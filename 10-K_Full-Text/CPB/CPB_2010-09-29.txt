Business

The
    Company

Campbell Soup Company (“Campbell” or the
    “company”), together with its consolidated
    subsidiaries, is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Campbell was
    incorporated as a business corporation under the laws of New
    Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor
    organizations, it traces its heritage in the food business back
    to 1869. The company’s principal executive offices are in
    Camden, New Jersey

08103-1799.

The company’s operations are organized and reported in the
    following segments: U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages; Baking
    and Snacking; International Soup, Sauces and Beverages; and
    North America Foodservice. The segments are discussed in greater
    detail below.

U.S.
    Soup, Sauces and Beverages

The U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment comprises the
    U.S. retail business, including the following products:

Campbell’s

condensed and

ready-to-serve

soups;

Swanson

broth, stocks and canned poultry;

Prego

pasta sauce;

Pace

Mexican sauce;

Campbell’s

canned pasta, gravies, and beans;

V8

vegetable
    juices;

V8 V-Fusion

juices and beverages;

V8 Splash

juice drinks; and

Campbell’s

tomato juice.

Baking
    and Snacking

The Baking and Snacking segment includes the following
    businesses:

Pepperidge Farm

cookies, crackers, bakery and
    frozen products in U.S. retail; and

Arnott’s

biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific. As previously
    disclosed in May 2008, the company completed the divestiture of
    certain salty snack food brands and assets in Australia, which
    were historically included in this segment.

International
    Soup, Sauces and Beverages

The International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment includes
    the soup, sauce and beverage businesses outside of the United
    States, including Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific
    region, as well as the emerging markets of Russia and China, and
    the retail business in Canada. The segment’s operations
    include

Erasco

and

Heisse Tasse

soups in Germany,

Liebig

and

Royco

soups in France,

Devos Lemmens

mayonnaise and cold sauces and

Campbell’s

and

Royco

soups in Belgium, and

Blå Band

soups
    and sauces in Sweden. In Asia Pacific, operations include

Campbell’s

soup and stock,

Swanson

broths,

V8

beverages and

Prego

pasta sauce. In Canada,
    operations include

Habitant

and

Campbell’s

soups,

Prego

pasta sauce,

Pace

Mexican sauce,

V8

beverages and certain Pepperidge Farm products. The
    French sauce and mayonnaise business, which was marketed under
    the

Lesieur

brand and divested on September 29,
    2008, was historically included in this segment.

North
    America Foodservice

The North America Foodservice segment includes the
    company’s Away From Home operations, which represent the
    distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrees,
    beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm
    products through various food service channels in the United
    States and Canada.

Ingredients
    and Packaging

The ingredients and packaging required for the manufacture of
    the company’s food products are purchased from various
    suppliers. These items are subject to fluctuations in price
    attributable to a number of factors, including changes in crop
    size, cattle cycles, product scarcity, demand for raw materials,
    energy costs, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import
    and export requirements and weather conditions (including the
    potential effects of climate change) during the growing and
    harvesting seasons. To help reduce some of this price
    volatility, the company uses a combination of purchase orders,
    short- and long-term contracts and various commodity risk
    management tools for most of its ingredients and packaging.
    Ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall


and decline during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients
    of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only
    at certain seasons, the company makes commitments for the
    purchase of such ingredients during their respective seasons. At
    this time, the company does not anticipate any material
    restrictions on availability or shortages of ingredients or
    packaging that would have a significant impact on the
    company’s businesses. For information on the impact of
    inflation on the company, see “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition.”

Customers

In most of the company’s markets, sales activities are
    conducted by the company’s own sales force and through
    broker and distributor arrangements. In the United States,
    Canada and Latin America, the company’s products are
    generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass
    discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience
    stores, drug stores, dollar stores and other retail, commercial
    and non-commercial establishments. In Europe, the company’s
    products are generally resold to consumers in retail food
    chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores,
    convenience stores and other retail, commercial and
    non-commercial establishments. In the Asia Pacific region, the
    company’s products are generally resold to consumers
    through retail food chains, convenience stores and other retail,
    commercial and non-commercial establishments. The company makes
    shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance of orders.

The company’s largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and
    its affiliates, accounted for approximately 18% of the
    company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2010 and fiscal
    2009, and 16% in fiscal 2008. All of the company’s segments
    sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No
    other customer accounted for 10% or more of the company’s
    consolidated net sales.

Trademarks
    and Technology

As of September 15, 2010, the company owned over 4,100
    trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries
    and believes that its trademarks are of material importance to
    its business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks
    generally are valid as long as they are in use

and/or

their
    registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to
    have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be
    renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. The
    company believes that its principal brands, including

Campbell’s

,

Erasco

,

Liebig

,

Pepperidge Farm

,

Goldfish

,

V8

,

Pace

,

Prego

,

Swanson

, and

Arnott’s,

are
    protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are
    used. In addition, some of the company’s products are sold
    under brands that have been licensed from third parties.

Although the company owns a number of valuable patents, it does
    not regard any segment of its business as being dependent upon
    any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, the
    company owns copyrights, both registered and unregistered, and
    proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and
    other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

Competition

The company experiences worldwide competition in all of its
    principal products. This competition arises from numerous
    competitors of varying sizes, including producers of generic and
    private label products, as well as from manufacturers of other
    branded food products, which compete for trade merchandising
    support and consumer dollars. As such, the number of competitors
    cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition
    are brand recognition, quality, price, advertising, promotion,
    convenience and service.

Working
    Capital

For information relating to the company’s cash and working
    capital items, see “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”



Capital
    Expenditures

During fiscal 2010, the company’s aggregate capital
    expenditures were $315 million. The company expects to
    spend approximately $300 million for capital projects in
    fiscal 2011. Major fiscal 2011 capital projects include
    continued enhancement of the company’s corporate
    headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, an upgrade to the
    company’s research and development capabilities and the
    upgrade of certain manufacturing equipment at various facilities
    in the U.S.

Research
    and Development

During the last three fiscal years, the company’s
    expenditures on research activities relating to new products and
    the improvement and maintenance of existing products for
    continuing operations were $123 million in 2010,
    $114 million in 2009, and $115 million in 2008. The
    increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in
    compensation and benefit costs, costs associated with an
    initiative to simplify the soup-making process in
    North America, and the impact of currency. The decrease
    from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to the impact of currency.
    The company conducts this research primarily at its headquarters
    in Camden, New Jersey, although important research is undertaken
    at various other locations inside and outside the United States.

Environmental
    Matters

The company has requirements for the operation and design of its
    facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules
    and regulations. Of the company’s $315 million in
    capital expenditures made during fiscal 2010, approximately
    $10 million was for compliance with environmental laws and
    regulations in the United States. The company further estimates
    that approximately $7 million of the capital expenditures
    anticipated during fiscal 2011 will be for compliance with
    United States environmental laws and regulations. The company
    believes that continued compliance with existing environmental
    laws and regulations will not have a material effect on capital
    expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the
    company.

Seasonality

Demand for the company’s products is somewhat seasonal,
    with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the
    highest sales volume due primarily to demand for the
    company’s soup products. Demand for the company’s
    sauce, beverage, baking and snacking products, however, is
    generally evenly distributed throughout the year.

Employees

On August 1, 2010, there were approximately
    18,400 employees of the company.

Financial
    Information

    and identifiable assets attributable to the company’s
    business segments and geographic areas, see Note 6 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report,
    the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely
    affect the company’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations. Additional risks



and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the
    company currently deems immaterial also may impair the
    company’s business operations and financial condition.

The
    company operates in a highly competitive industry

The company operates in the highly competitive food industry and
    experiences worldwide competition in all of its principal
    products. The principal areas of competition are brand
    recognition, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience
    and service. A number of the company’s primary competitors
    have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A
    strong competitive response from one or more of these
    competitors to the company’s marketplace efforts, or a
    consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in
    the company reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other
    expenditures,

and/or

losing market share.

The
    company faces risks related to recession, financial and credit
    market disruptions and other economic conditions

Customer and consumer demand for the company’s products may
    be impacted by recession or other economic downturns in the
    United States or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in
    financial and credit markets may impact the company’s
    ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its
    customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in any
    one of the following factors in the United States or other
    nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market
    disruptions or other reasons, could impact the company: tax
    rates, interest rates or equity markets.

Increased
    regulation could adversely affect the company’s business or
    financial results

The manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively
    regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the
    processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising,
    labeling, quality and safety of the company’s food
    products, as well as the health and safety of the company’s
    employees and the protection of the environment. In the United
    States, the company is subject to regulation by various
    government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration,
    the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade
    Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
    and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various
    state and local agencies. The company is also regulated by
    similar agencies outside the United States and by voluntary
    organizations, such as the National Advertising Division and the
    Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative of the
    Council of Better Business Bureaus. Changes in regulatory
    requirements (such as proposed requirements designed to enhance
    food safety or restrict food marketing), or evolving
    interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result
    in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other
    financial obligations that could adversely affect the
    company’s business or financial results.

Fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the
    company’s results

The company holds assets and incurs liabilities, earns revenue,
    and pays expenses in a variety of currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar, Canadian
    dollar, and the euro. The company’s consolidated financial
    statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and therefore the
    company must translate its assets, liabilities, revenue, and
    expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes.
    As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may
    materially and negatively affect the value of these items in the
    company’s consolidated financial statements, even if their
    value has not changed in their original currency.

The
    company’s results may be adversely impacted by increases in
    the price of raw and packaging materials

The raw and packaging materials used in the company’s
    business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry,
    vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these
    materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of
    factors, including product scarcity, demand for raw materials,
    commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency
    fluctuations, weather conditions (including the potential
    effects of climate change), import and export requirements and
    changes in government-sponsored agricultural programs. To the
    extent any of these factors result



in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, the company
    may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or
    price increases or through its commodity hedging activity.

The
    company’s results are dependent on successful marketplace
    initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the company’s
    products

The company’s results are dependent on successful
    marketplace initiatives and acceptance by consumers of the
    company’s products. The company’s product
    introductions and product improvements, along with its other
    marketplace initiatives, are designed to capitalize on customer
    or consumer trends. In order to remain successful, the company
    must anticipate and react to these trends and develop new
    products or processes to address them. While the company devotes
    significant resources to meeting this goal, the company may not
    be successful in developing new products or processes, or its
    new products or processes may not be accepted by customers or
    consumers.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and
    costs related to its defined benefit pension plans

The company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans
    for employees in the United States and various foreign
    locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded
    with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio
    of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory
    requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment
    returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the
    funded status of the company’s defined benefit pension
    plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost,
    future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status
    as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in the
    company’s obligations or future funding requirements could
    have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the
    company.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by the increased significance
    of some of its customers

The retail grocery trade continues to consolidate. These
    consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with
    increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek
    lower prices or increased promotional programs funded by their
    suppliers. These customers may also in the future use more of
    their shelf space, currently used for the company’s
    products, for their private label products. If the company is
    unable to use its scale, marketing expertise, product innovation
    and category leadership positions to respond to these customer
    initiatives, the company’s business or financial results
    could be negatively impacted. In addition, the disruption of
    sales to any of the company’s large customers for an
    extended period of time could adversely affect the
    company’s business or financial results.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or failure
    of, its information technology systems

Each year the company engages in several billion dollars of
    transactions with its customers and vendors. Because the amount
    of dollars involved is so significant, the company’s
    information technology resources must provide connections among
    its marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer
    service, and accounting functions. If the company does not
    allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build
    and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure and to
    maintain the related computerized and manual control processes,
    the company’s business or financial results could be
    negatively impacted.

The
    company may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost
    savings or benefits from, its ongoing supply chain, information
    technology or other initiatives

The company’s success is partly dependent upon properly
    executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from,
    its ongoing supply chain, information technology and other
    initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make
    the company more efficient in the manufacture and distribution
    of its products, which is necessary in the company’s highly
    competitive industry. These initiatives are often complex, and a
    failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not
    meeting projected cost savings or benefits, result in an
    interruption to the company’s sales, manufacturing,
    logistics, customer service or accounting functions.



Disruption
    to the company’s supply chain could adversely affect its
    business

Damage or disruption to the company’s suppliers or to the
    company’s manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to
    weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes,
    or other reasons could impair the company’s ability to
    manufacture

and/or

sell
    its products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the
    likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively
    manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is
    sourced from a single location, could adversely affect the
    company’s business or financial results.

The
    company may be adversely impacted by the failure to execute
    acquisitions and divestitures successfully

From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or
    divestitures. The success of any such acquisition or divestiture
    depends, in part, upon the company’s ability to identify
    suitable buyers or sellers, negotiate favorable contractual
    terms and, in many cases, obtain governmental approval. For
    acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently
    integrating the acquired business into the company’s
    existing operations, successfully managing new risks associated
    with the acquired business and achieving expected returns and
    other benefits. Acquisitions outside the United States may
    present unique challenges or increase the company’s
    exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including
    foreign currency risks and the risks of complying with foreign
    regulations. Finally, for acquisitions, the company may incur
    substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely
    impact its credit rating. In cases where acquisitions or
    divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, the
    company’s business or financial results could be negatively
    impacted.

The
    company’s results may be impacted negatively by political
    conditions in the nations where the company does
    business

The company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. Because of its
    global reach, the company’s performance may be impacted
    negatively by politically motivated factors, such as unfavorable
    changes in tariffs or export and import restrictions, in the
    nations where it does business. The company may also be impacted
    by political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities
    and terrorist acts in the nations where it does business.

If the
    company’s food products become adulterated or are
    mislabeled, the company might need to recall those items and may
    experience product liability claims if consumers are
    injured

The company may need to recall some of its products if they
    become adulterated or if they are mislabeled. The company may
    also be liable if the consumption of any of its products causes
    injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant
    losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product
    inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product
    for a period of time. The company could also suffer losses from
    a significant product liability judgment against it. A
    significant product recall or product liability case could also
    result in adverse publicity, damage to the company’s
    reputation and a loss of consumer confidence in the
    company’s products. In addition, the company’s results
    could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the
    safety and quality of the company’s products, ingredients
    or packaging, even in the absence of a recall or a product
    liability case. Adverse publicity about the company’s
    products, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from
    buying the company’s products.

Each of the foregoing manufacturing facilities is company-owned,
    except that the Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia, facility, and
    the East Brunswick, New Jersey, facility are leased. The
    Utrecht, Netherlands, facility is subject to a ground lease. The
    company has proposed the transfer of ownership of the Utrecht,
    Netherlands, facility to a third party in fiscal 2011 as part of
    a contract manufacturing arrangement. The company also operates
    retail bakery thrift stores in the United States and other
    plants, facilities and offices at various locations in the
    United States and abroad, including additional executive offices
    in Norwalk, Connecticut, Puurs, Belgium, and North Strathfield,
    Australia. The Wauseon, Ohio, facility was closed and sold in
    fiscal 2010, and the Guasave, Mexico, facility was closed in
    fiscal 2010.

Management believes that the company’s manufacturing and
    processing plants are well maintained and are generally adequate
    to support the current operations of the businesses.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition

Overview

Description
    of the Company

Campbell Soup Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
    high-quality, branded convenience food products. The company is
    organized and reports in the following segments: U.S. Soup,
    Sauces and Beverages; Baking and Snacking; International Soup,
    Sauces and Beverages; and North America Foodservice. See
    Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information on segments.

Key
    Strategies

The company’s strategies for driving consistent and
    sustainable sales and earnings growth for long-term total
    shareowner value are:

1. grow its icon brands within simple meals, baked snacks
    and healthy beverages;

2. deliver higher levels of consumer satisfaction through
    superior innovation focused on wellness while providing good
    value, quality and convenience;

3. make its products more broadly available and relevant in
    existing and new markets, consumer segments and eating occasions;

4. strengthen its business through outside partnerships and
    acquisitions;

5. increase margins by improving price realization and
    company-wide total cost management;

6. improve overall organizational excellence, diversity and
    engagement; and

7. advance a powerful commitment to sustainability and
    corporate social responsibility.



Grow the company’s icon brands within simple meals,
    baked snacks and healthy
    beverages.

Campbell’s overarching business
    strategy is to drive profitable growth by focusing on three
    large and growing categories — simple meals, baked
    snacks, and healthy beverages — in geographies where
    it has strong brands, leading share positions and regional
    scale. Most of the company’s sales currently are
    attributable to the United States, Australia, Canada, France,
    Germany and Belgium. Its major brands in these categories and
    geographies include

Campbell’s, Swanson, Pace, Prego,
    Liebig, Erasco, Pepperidge Farm, Arnott’s,

and

V8.

The company intends to enhance the growth of its healthy
    beverages and baked snacks portfolio of businesses through
    increased innovation and marketing support. The company also
    expects to grow its simple meal businesses by increasing its
    focus on meal-makers, which are ingredients and components used
    to make a meal, such as broth, sauces and cooking soups, while
    continuing investments behind its condensed eating and

ready-to-serve

soups.

Deliver higher levels of consumer satisfaction through
    superior innovation focused on wellness while providing good
    value, quality and convenience.

Consumers are
    seeking and will continue to seek products with a strong
    value-orientation and with health and wellness benefits.
    Campbell is pursuing initiatives designed to address these
    consumer trends and to drive strong levels of consumer
    satisfaction. For example, in fiscal 2011, building on the
    success of the

V8 V-Fusion

juice offerings, the company
    will introduce a number of new

V8 V-Fusion

Plus Tea

products. In the baked snacks category, the company
    plans to continue upgrading the health credentials of its
    cracker (or savory biscuit) offerings. Responding to the
    consumer’s value-oriented focus,

Campbell’s

condensed soups will be relaunched with a new contemporary
    packaging design and an upgrade to the company’s
    gravity-fed shelving system. In the

ready-to-serve

soup portfolio, a number of the company’s offerings in the
    United States, Canada, Germany, France, Belgium and Australia
    will be enhanced. Finally, all of the company’s

Campbell’s

-branded U.S. soups will benefit from
    a unified advertising campaign focusing on the taste and
    nutritional attributes of the company’s soup products.

Make the company’s products more broadly available and
    relevant in existing and new markets, consumer segments and
    eating occasions.

Campbell will pursue strategies
    designed to expand the availability and relevance of its
    products in existing and new markets, including new consumer
    segments and eating occasions. Campbell will continue to develop
    its businesses in the emerging markets of Russia and China. In
    addition, to capitalize on the global trend of more in-home meal
    preparation by consumers, the company will focus consumers on
    its extensive portfolio of meal-maker offerings, such as broths,
    sauces and cooking soups.

Strengthen the company’s business through outside
    partnerships and acquisitions.

Campbell continues
    to explore opportunities to accelerate sales and earnings growth
    through value-creating external development in its core and
    adjacent categories.

Increase margins by improving price realization and
    company-wide total cost management.

Over the long
    term, the company is committed to increasing margins though a
    combination of pricing and cost management efforts. In fiscal
    2010, with the assistance of a number of successful supply chain
    initiatives, costs per unit declined. Campbell will continue
    these efforts in fiscal 2011 by leveraging its new SAP
    enterprise-resource planning system and by simplifying the
    soup-making process in its North American manufacturing network.
    The company also will pursue efficiency initiatives in its
    selling and administrative costs.

Improve overall organizational excellence, diversity and
    engagement.

Campbell is committed to building a
    world-class organization that is diverse, inclusive and engaged.
    In order to attract, develop and retain the best talent, the
    company focuses on manager quality, employee engagement,
    leadership behavior, employee affinity groups, workplace
    flexibility and employee wellness. As part of these efforts, the
    company recently opened a new 80,000-square foot employee center
    at its world headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.

Advance a powerful commitment to sustainability and corporate
    social responsibility (CSR).

The company’s
    commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility
    is centered around four key pillars: environmental performance,
    community outreach, workplace excellence, and the nutrition and
    wellness attributes of the company’s products. The company
    has established long-term destination goals against each of
    these four pillars and developed strategies to attain these
    goals. The goals and strategies are described in the
    company’s 2010 CSR report.

    and net earnings per share:

Continuing
    Operations

•

In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the company recorded
    deferred tax expense of $10 million, or $.03 per share, to
    reduce deferred tax assets as a result of the U.S. health
    care legislation enacted in March 2010. The law changed the tax
    treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription
    drug benefits to retirees;

•

In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the company recorded a
    restructuring charge of $12 million ($8 million after
    tax or $.02 per share) for pension benefit costs related to the

Earnings from continuing operations were $844 million in
    2010 ($2.42 per share) and $732 million ($2.03 per share)
    in 2009. After adjusting for the items impacting comparability,
    Earnings from continuing operations increased primarily due to
    improved gross margin performance and the impact of currency,
    partially offset by lower sales volume. Earnings per share from
    continuing operations benefited from a reduction in the weighted
    average diluted shares outstanding, which was primarily due to
    share repurchases under the company’s strategic share
    repurchase program.

Earnings from discontinued operations of $4 million in 2009
    represented an adjustment to the tax liability associated with
    the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business.

Earnings
    from Continuing and Discontinued Operations — 2009
    Compared with 2008

Net earnings were $736 million in 2009 ($2.05 per share)
    and $1,165 million ($3.03 per share) in 2008.

In addition to the 2009 items that impacted comparability of net
    earnings and net earnings per share, the following items also
    impacted comparability:

Continuing
    Operations

•

In fiscal 2008, the company recorded a pre-tax restructuring
    charge of $175 million ($102 million after tax or $.27
    per share) and $7 million ($5 million after tax or
    $.01 per share) of accelerated depreciation in Cost of products
    sold. The aggregate impact was $182 million
    ($107 million after tax or $.28 per share) related to the
    initiatives. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements and “Restructuring Charges” for additional
    information; and

•

In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the company recognized a
    non-cash tax benefit of $13 million ($.03 per share) from
    the favorable resolution of a state tax contingency in the
    United States.

Discontinued
    Operations

•

In 2008, the company recognized a pre-tax gain of
    $698 million ($462 million after tax or $1.20 per
    share) from the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business.

The sum of the individual per share amounts does not equal due
    to rounding.

Earnings from continuing operations were $732 million in
    2009 ($2.03 per share) and $671 million ($1.75 per share)
    in 2008. After adjusting for the items impacting comparability,
    Earnings from continuing operations increased primarily due to
    lower interest expense, lower marketing and selling expenses,
    partially offset by the negative impact of currency translation.
    Earnings per share from continuing operations benefited from a
    reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
    The reduction was primarily due to share repurchases utilizing
    the net proceeds from the divestiture of the Godiva Chocolatier
    business and the company’s strategic share repurchase
    programs. Earnings per share from continuing operations were
    negatively impacted by $.09 from currency translation in 2009.

Earnings from discontinued operations of $4 million in 2009
    represented an adjustment to the tax liability associated with
    the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business. Earnings from
    discontinued operations were $494 million in 2008 and
    included the $462 million gain from the sale of the Godiva
    Chocolatier business. Earnings per share from discontinued
    operations were $.01 in 2009 and $1.28 in 2008. The operations
    of Godiva contributed to earnings of $.08 per share in 2008.

Basis
    of Presentation

There were 52 weeks in fiscal 2010 and 2009, and
    53 weeks in fiscal 2008.

In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued accounting guidance related to the calculation of
    earnings per share. The guidance provides that unvested
    share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights
    to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid)
    are participating securities and shall be included in the
    computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class
    method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula
    that determines earnings per share for each class of common
    stock and participating security according to dividends declared
    and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The company
    adopted and retrospectively applied the new guidance in the
    first quarter of 2010. The retrospective application of the
    provision resulted in the following reductions to basic and
    diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008:

    entered into a master licensing agreement with Wolfgang Puck
    Worldwide, Inc. for the use of the

    sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products sold under
    the

Lesieur

brand in France. The business had annual net
    sales of approximately $70 million. The sale was completed
    on September 29, 2008 and generated $36 million of
    proceeds. The purchase price was subject to working capital and
    other post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional
    $6 million of proceeds. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information.

In the third quarter of 2008, the company entered into an
    agreement to sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and
    assets. The transaction, which was completed on May 12,
    2008, included salty snack brands such as

Cheezels

,

Thins

,

Tasty Jacks

,

French Fries

, and

Kettle Chips

, certain other assets and the assumption of
    liabilities. Proceeds of the sale were nominal. The business had
    annual net sales of approximately $150 million. This
    transaction is included in the restructuring initiatives
    described in Note 7.

In March 2008, the company completed the sale of its Godiva
    Chocolatier business for $850 million, pursuant to a Sale
    and Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The
    purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments,
    which resulted in an additional $20 million of proceeds.
    The company has reflected the results of this business as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    earnings. The company used approximately $600 million of
    the net proceeds to purchase company stock. See Note 3 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Represents revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer
    coupon redemption programs.

In 2010, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales decreased
    2%. U.S. soup sales decreased 4%, due to the following:

•

Sales of

Campbell’s

condensed soups declined 2%, as
    declines in eating varieties were partially offset by gains in
    cooking varieties.

•

Sales of

ready-to-serve

soups decreased 9% with declines in both canned and microwavable
    varieties.

•

Broth sales increased 3% reflecting benefits from growth of
    in-home eating occasions and consumer demand for 100% natural
    product offerings.

Within the U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment,
    beverage sales increased 4% in 2010 primarily due to higher
    sales of

V8 V-Fusion

vegetable and fruit juice and gains
    in

V8 Splash

juice drinks, partly offset by lower sales
    of

V8

vegetable juice.

V8 V-Fusion

vegetable and
    fruit juice sales increased double digits due to increased
    advertising and new item launches.

Prego

pasta sauce
    sales increased, reflecting growth of

Prego

Heart Smart
    varieties, while

Pace

Mexican sauce sales declined.

In 2009, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased
    3%. U.S. soup sales increased 5% as

ready-to-serve

soup sales increased 4%, condensed soup sales increased 5% and
    broth sales increased 9%. The

ready-to-serve

soup sales increase was primarily due to the successful launches
    of

Campbell’s Select Harvest

soups and

Campbell’s V8

soups, partially offset by declines in

Campbell’s Chunky

soups. Within

ready-to-serve,

sales declined in the convenience platform, which includes soups
    in microwavable bowls and cups. In condensed, sales increased
    with growth in cooking and in eating varieties. The increase in
    broth sales was due to growth in aseptic varieties and the
    introduction of

Swanson

stock products. The

Wolfgang
    Puck

soup, stock and broth business acquired in June 2008
    contributed modestly to U.S. soup sales growth. Beverage
    sales decreased due to declines in

V8

vegetable juice,



partially offset by gains in

V8 V-Fusion

vegetable and
    fruit juice.

Prego

pasta sauce sales increased double
    digits and sales of

Pace

Mexican sauces increased
    reflecting growth of in-home eating occasions.

In 2010, Baking and Snacking sales increased 7% primarily due to
    currency. Pepperidge Farm sales were comparable to a year ago,
    as the additional sales from the acquisition of Ecce Panis, Inc.
    and volume gains were offset by increased promotional spending.
    Arnott’s sales increased due to currency and growth in

Tim Tam

chocolate biscuits and

Shapes

savory
    crackers.

In 2009, Baking and Snacking sales decreased 10%. Pepperidge
    Farm achieved sales growth with gains in the cookies and
    crackers business, reflecting significant growth in

Goldfish

snack crackers. Arnott’s sales declined due to the
    divestiture of certain salty snack food brands in May 2008, the
    unfavorable impact of currency and the impact of one less week
    in 2009. Excluding these items, Arnott’s sales increased
    due to growth in savory and chocolate biscuit products and
    growth in Indonesia.

In 2010, International Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales
    increased 5% primarily due to currency, partly offset by the
    divestiture of the company’s French sauce and mayonnaise
    business in September 2008. In Europe, sales declined,
    reflecting lower sales in Germany and the impact of the
    divestiture, partly offset by the impact of currency. In Asia
    Pacific, sales increased due to currency and volume-driven gains
    in Japan, Australia and Malaysia. In Canada, sales increased due
    to currency, partially offset by lower sales volume of

ready-to-serve

soups.

In 2009, International Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales declined
    16%. In Europe, sales declined due to the divestiture of the
    French sauce and mayonnaise business, the impact of currency,
    one less week in 2009, and lower sales in Germany. In the Asia
    Pacific region, sales declined due to the impact of currency and
    one less week in 2009, partially offset by gains in Malaysia and
    in the Australian soup business. In Canada, sales decreased due
    to currency and one less week in 2009, partially offset by gains
    in the soup business.

In 2010, North America Foodservice sales declined 4% primarily
    due to continued weakness in the food service sector.

In 2009, North America Foodservice sales declined 9% primarily
    due to weakness in the food service sector and the unfavorable
    impact of currency.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold,
    increased by $122 million in 2010 from 2009 and decreased
    by $143 million in 2009 from 2008. As a percent of sales,
    gross profit was 41.0% in 2010, 39.9% in 2009, and 39.6% in
    2008. The percentage point increase in 2010 was due to higher
    selling prices (approximately 0.8 percentage point),
    productivity improvements (approximately 2.1 percentage
    points), costs in the prior year related to the initiatives to
    improve operational efficiency and long-term profitability
    (approximately 0.3 percentage point), and mix
    (0.1 percentage point), partially offset by a higher level
    of promotional spending (approximately 1.2 percentage
    points) and the impact of cost inflation and other factors
    (approximately 1 percentage point). The percentage point
    increase in 2009 was due to higher selling prices (approximately
    4.4 percentage points), productivity improvements
    (approximately 1.8 percentage points) and mix
    (0.4 percentage point), partially offset by a higher level
    of promotional spending (approximately 1.1 percentage
    points) and the impact of cost inflation and other factors
    (approximately 5.2 percentage points).

Marketing
    and Selling Expenses

Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 13.8%
    in 2010, 14.2% in 2009, and 14.5% in 2008. Marketing and selling
    expenses decreased 2% in 2010 from 2009. The decrease was
    primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion costs
    (approximately 3 percentage points) and lower marketing
    expenses (approximately 1 percentage point), partially
    offset by the impact of currency (approximately
    2 percentage points). The lower advertising expenses in the
    current year reflected a reduction in media rates and a shift to
    trade promotion in many of the businesses. Marketing and selling
    expenses decreased 7% in 2009 from 2008. The decrease was
    primarily due to the impact of currency (approximately
    3 percentage points), lower marketing expenses
    (approximately 2 percentage points), and lower selling
    expenses (approximately 2 percentage points). In 2009,
    while



advertising expenses increased in U.S. soup to support the
    launch of new products, marketing expenses were reduced in other
    businesses to fund increased promotional activity.

Administrative
    Expenses

Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.9% in 2010,
    7.8% in 2009, and 7.6% in 2008. Administrative expenses
    increased by 2% in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to the impact
    of currency (approximately 2 percentage points), an
    increase in compensation and benefit costs, including pension
    expense (approximately 2 percentage points), partially
    offset by the company’s cost management efforts and other
    factors (approximately 2 percentage points). Administrative
    expenses declined 3% in 2009 from 2008 due primarily to the
    impact of currency.

Research
    and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses increased $9 million or
    8% in 2010 from 2009. The increase was primarily due to an
    increase in compensation and benefit costs (approximately
    4 percentage points), costs associated with an initiative
    to simplify the soup-making process in North America
    (approximately 2 percentage points), and the impact of
    currency (approximately 2 percentage points). Research and
    development expenses decreased $1 million or 1% in 2009
    from 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of
    currency (approximately 3 percentage points), partially
    offset by an increase in wages and other costs (approximately
    2 percentage points).

Other
    Expenses/(Income)

Other expense in 2009 included a $67 million impairment
    charge associated with certain European trademarks primarily
    used in Germany and the Nordic region. The charge was recorded
    as a result of the company’s annual review of intangible
    assets and was reflected in the International Soup, Sauces and
    Beverages segment. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Other expense in 2008 included $6 million of impairment
    charges associated with certain trademarks used in the
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment and the pending
    sale of the sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products
    sold under the

Lesieur

brand in France. See also
    Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating
    Earnings

Segment operating earnings increased 14% in 2010 from 2009 and
    increased 5% in 2009 from 2008. The 2010 results included
    $12 million of restructuring charges. The 2009 results
    included $22 million of restructuring-related costs and a
    $67 million impairment charge. The 2008 results included
    $182 million of restructuring charges and related costs.

Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased 2%
    in 2010 versus 2009 primarily due to an improvement in gross
    margin percentage and lower advertising expenses, partially
    offset by lower sales.

Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces, and Beverages increased 4%
    in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to pricing, net of increased
    promotional spending, and productivity improvements, which more
    than offset cost inflation and lower sales volume.

Earnings from Baking and Snacking increased 23% in 2010 versus
    2009. The prior year included $3 million in
    restructuring-related costs. The increase in operating earnings
    was due to the impact of currency and earnings growth in
    Pepperidge Farm and Arnott’s.

Earnings from Baking and Snacking increased from
    $120 million in 2008 to $262 million in 2009. Earnings
    in 2009 included $3 million in accelerated depreciation and
    other exit costs and earnings in 2008 included $144 million
    of restructuring charges related to the initiatives to improve
    operational efficiency and long-term profitability. Excluding
    these items, operating earnings growth in Pepperidge Farm and
    Arnott’s was mostly offset by the negative impact of
    currency and one less week.

Earnings from International Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased
    to $161 million from $69 million in 2009. Earnings in
    2009 included a $67 million impairment charge on certain
    European trademarks, primarily in Germany and the Nordic region.
    Excluding the impairment charge, the increase in operating
    earnings was primarily due to the impact of currency and growth
    in the businesses in Europe as well as Asia Pacific, partially
    offset by declines in Canada.

Earnings from International Soup, Sauces and Beverages decreased
    from $179 million in 2008 to $69 million in 2009.
    Earnings in 2009 included a $67 million impairment charge
    on certain European trademarks, primarily in Germany and the
    Nordic region. Earnings in 2008 included $9 million of
    restructuring charges related to the initiatives to improve
    operational efficiency and long-term profitability. Excluding
    these items, operating earnings declined, primarily due to the
    impact of currency and costs associated with establishing
    businesses in Russia and China.

Earnings from North America Foodservice increased to
    $43 million in 2010 from $34 million in 2009. The
    current year included $12 million in restructuring charges,
    and the prior year included $19 million in
    restructuring-related costs. Excluding these items, earnings
    increased slightly due to cost reduction efforts.

Earnings from North America Foodservice decreased 15% in 2009
    from 2008. Earnings in 2009 included $19 million in
    restructuring-related costs and earnings in 2008 included
    $29 million of restructuring charges and costs associated
    with the initiatives to improve operational efficiency and
    long-term profitability. Excluding these items, earnings
    decreased reflecting the reduction in sales.

Unallocated corporate expenses increased from $107 million
    in 2009 to $121 million in 2010. The increase was primarily
    due to foreign exchange gains recorded in the prior year and
    higher equity-related benefit costs in the current year.

Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $25 million from
    $132 million in 2008 to $107 million in 2009. The
    decrease was primarily due to lower expenses associated with the
    company’s North American SAP implementation.



Interest
    Expense/Income

Interest expense increased to $112 million in 2010 from
    $110 million in 2009 primarily due to an increase in
    fixed-rate debt and higher average debt levels, partially offset
    by lower average short-term rates. Interest income increased to
    $6 million in 2010 from $4 million in 2009 primarily
    due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents.

Interest expense decreased to $110 million in 2009 from
    $167 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates.
    Interest income declined to $4 million in 2009 from
    $8 million in 2008 primarily due to lower levels of cash
    and cash equivalents.

Taxes
    on Earnings

The effective tax rate was 32.0% in 2010, 32.2% in 2009, and
    28.5% in 2008. The following factors impacted the comparability
    of the tax rate in 2010 versus 2009:

•

In 2010, the company recognized deferred tax expense of
    $10 million as a result of the enactment of
    U.S. health care legislation in March 2010. The law changed
    the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide
    prescription drug benefits to retirees. The company recorded the
    adjustment to reduce the value of the deferred tax asset
    associated with the subsidy.

•

In 2009, the company recognized an $11 million benefit
    following the finalization of tax audits.

The effective rate decreased in 2010 from 2009 reflecting
    additional tax expense associated with the repatriation of
    foreign earnings in the prior year.

The following factors impacted the 2008 tax rate:

•

In 2008, the company recognized a tax benefit of
    $75 million on the $182 million pre-tax restructuring
    charge and related costs.

•

In 2008, the company recognized a $13 million benefit from
    the resolution of a state tax contingency.

The effective rate increased in 2009 from 2008 reflecting
    additional tax expense associated with the repatriation of
    foreign earnings. The 2008 effective rate reflects a benefit for
    tax rate changes in foreign jurisdictions.

Restructuring
    Charges

On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of
    initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands
    and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities
    in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the company’s
    management structure. As a result of these initiatives, in 2008,
    the company recorded a restructuring charge of $175 million
    ($102 million after tax or $.27 per share). The charge
    consisted of a net loss of $120 million ($64 million
    after tax) on the sale of certain Australian salty snack food
    brands and assets, $45 million ($31 million after tax)
    of employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated
    impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and
    $10 million ($7 million after tax) of property, plant
    and equipment impairment charges. In addition, approximately
    $7 million ($5 million after tax or $.01 per share) of
    costs related to these initiatives were recorded in Cost of
    products sold, primarily representing accelerated depreciation
    on property, plant and equipment. The aggregate after-tax impact
    of restructuring charges and related costs in 2008 was
    $107 million, or $.28 per share.

In 2009, the company recorded approximately $22 million
    ($15 million after tax or $.04 per share) of costs related
    to the 2008 initiatives in Cost of products sold. Approximately
    $17 million ($12 million after tax) of the costs
    represented accelerated depreciation on property, plant and
    equipment; approximately $4 million ($2 million after
    tax) related to other exit costs; and approximately
    $1 million related to employee severance and benefit costs,
    including other pension charges.

In 2010, the company recorded a restructuring charge of
    $12 million ($8 million after tax or $.02 per share)
    for pension benefit costs, which represented the final costs
    associated with the 2008 initiatives.



Details of the components of the initiatives are as follows:

In the third quarter of 2008, as part of the initiatives, the
    company entered into an agreement to sell certain Australian
    salty snack food brands and assets. The transaction was
    completed on May 12, 2008. Proceeds of the sale were
    nominal. In connection with this transaction, the company
    recognized a net loss of $120 million ($64 million
    after tax) in 2008. The terms of the agreement required the
    company to provide a loan facility to the buyer of AUD
    $10 million, or approximately USD $9 million. The
    facility was drawn down in AUD $5 million increments in
    2009. Borrowings under the facility are to be repaid five years
    after the closing date. See also Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information.

In April 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company announced
    plans to close the Listowel, Ontario, Canada food plant. The
    Listowel facility produced primarily frozen products, including
    soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm products, as well as ramen
    noodles. The facility employed approximately 500 people.
    The company closed the facility in April 2009. Production was
    transitioned to its network of North American contract
    manufacturers and to its Downingtown, Pennsylvania plant. The
    company recorded $20 million ($14 million after tax)
    of employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated
    impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and
    $7 million ($5 million after tax) in accelerated
    depreciation of property, plant and equipment in 2008. In 2009,
    the company recorded $1 million of employee severance and
    benefit costs, including other pension charges, $16 million
    ($11 million after tax) in accelerated depreciation of
    property, plant and equipment and $2 million
    ($1 million after tax) of other exit costs. In 2010, the
    company recorded $12 million ($8 million after tax)
    for pension benefit costs, which represented the final costs
    associated with the initiatives.

In April 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company also
    announced plans to discontinue the private label biscuit and
    industrial chocolate production at its Miranda, Australia
    facility. The company closed the Miranda facility, which
    employed approximately 150 people, in the second quarter of
    2009. In connection with this action, the company recorded
    $10 million ($7 million after tax) of property, plant
    and equipment impairment charges and $8 million
    ($6 million after tax) in employee severance and benefit
    costs in 2008. In 2009, the company recorded $1 million in
    accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment and
    $2 million ($1 million after tax) of other exit costs.

As part of the 2008 initiatives, the company streamlined its
    management structure and eliminated certain overhead costs.
    These actions began in the fourth quarter of 2008 and were
    substantially completed in 2009. In connection with this action,
    the company recorded $17 million ($11 million after
    tax) in employee severance and benefit costs in 2008.

In aggregate, the company incurred pre-tax costs of
    approximately $216 million in 2008 through 2010 by segment
    as follows: Baking and Snacking — $147 million,
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages —
    $9 million and North America Foodservice —
    $60 million.

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

Discontinued
    Operations

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850 million, pursuant to a
    Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The
    purchase price was subject to working capital and other
    post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional
    $20 million of proceeds. The company has reflected the
    results of this business as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of earnings. The company used
    $600 million of the net proceeds from the sale to purchase
    company stock. In fiscal 2008, the company recognized a pre-tax
    gain of $698 million ($462 million after tax or $1.20
    per share) on the sale. In fiscal 2009, the company recognized a
    $4 million tax benefit as a result of an adjustment to the
    tax liability associated with the sale.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital
    resource requirements, including cash outflows to repurchase
    shares, pay dividends and fund pension plan contributions, will
    be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term
    borrowings under its shelf registration statement; short-term
    borrowings, including commercial paper; and cash and cash
    equivalents. Over the last three years, operating cash flows
    totaled approximately $3 billion. This cash generating
    capability provides the company with substantial financial
    flexibility in meeting its operating and investing needs. The
    company expects that its sources of financing are adequate to
    meet its future liquidity and capital resource requirements. The
    cost and terms of any future financing arrangements may be
    negatively impacted by capital and credit market disruptions and
    will depend on the market conditions and the company’s
    financial position at the time.

The company generated cash from operations of
    $1.057 billion in 2010, compared to $1.166 billion
    last year. The decline was primarily due to a $260 million
    contribution to a U.S. pension plan in 2010, partially
    offset by improvements in working capital requirements.

Net cash flows from operating activities provided
    $1.166 billion in 2009, compared to $766 million in
    2008. The increase was due to higher cash earnings and lower tax
    payments. In 2008, net cash flows from operations included tax
    payments associated with the divestiture of Godiva.

Capital expenditures were $315 million in 2010,
    $345 million in 2009, and $298 million in 2008.
    Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately
    $300 million in 2011. Capital expenditures in 2010 included
    expansion and enhancements of the company’s corporate
    headquarters (approximately $36 million), expansion of
    Arnott’s production capacity (approximately
    $21 million), the ongoing implementation of SAP in
    Australia and New Zealand (approximately $15 million) and
    expansion of Pepperidge Farm’s production capacity
    (approximately $14 million). Capital expenditures in 2009
    included expansion of the U.S. beverage production capacity
    (approximately $54 million) and expansion and enhancements
    of the company’s corporate headquarters (approximately
    $20 million). Capital expenditures in 2008 included
    investments to expand the Pepperidge Farm bakery production
    capacity, implement the SAP enterprise-resource planning system
    in North America, expand the U.S. beverage production
    capacity, and expand the warehouse at the Maxton, North Carolina
    facility.

Business acquired, as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows,
    represented the acquisition of the Ecce Panis, Inc. business in
    the fourth quarter of 2009 and the Wolfgang Puck soup business
    in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Net cash provided by investing activities in 2009 included
    $38 million of proceeds from the sale of the sauce and
    mayonnaise business in France, net of cash divested. Net cash
    provided by investing activities in 2008 included
    $828 million of proceeds from the sale of the Godiva
    Chocolatier business and certain Australian salty snack food
    brands and assets, net of cash divested.

Long-term borrowings in 2010 included the issuance in July of
    $400 million of 3.05% notes that mature in July 2017.
    Long-term borrowings in 2009 included the issuance in January of
    $300 million of 4.5% notes that mature in February
    2019 and the issuance in July of $300 million of
    3.375% notes that mature in August 2014. The net proceeds
    from these issuances were used for the repayment of commercial
    paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. There
    were no new long-term borrowings in 2008.



Dividend payments were $365 million in 2010,
    $350 million in 2009, and $329 million in 2008. Annual
    dividends declared in 2010 were $1.075 per share, $1.00 per
    share in 2009, and $.88 per share in 2008. The 2010 fourth
    quarter rate was $.275 per share.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares and
    for stock option exercises, the company repurchased
    14 million shares at a cost of $472 million during
    2010. Approximately 7 million of the shares repurchased in
    2010 were repurchased pursuant to the company’s June 2008
    publicly announced share repurchase program. Under this program,
    the company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of
    up to $1.2 billion of company stock through the end of
    fiscal 2011. Approximately $550 million remained available
    under the June 2008 repurchase program as of August 1,
    2010. In addition to the June 2008 publicly announced share
    repurchase program, the company also purchased shares to offset
    the impact of dilution from shares issued under the
    company’s stock compensation plans. The company expects to
    continue this practice in the future. See “Market for
    Registrant’s Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and
    Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for more information.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares,
    the company repurchased 17 million shares at a cost of
    $527 million during 2009. Approximately 13 million of
    the shares repurchased in 2009 were repurchased pursuant to the
    company’s June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase
    program. In addition to the June 2008 publicly announced share
    repurchase program, the company also purchased shares to offset
    the impact of dilution from shares issued under the
    company’s stock compensation plans.

Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax
    withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares,
    the company repurchased 26 million shares at a cost of
    $903 million during 2008. During fiscal 2008, the company
    purchased shares pursuant to two publicly announced share
    repurchase programs. Under the first program, which was
    announced on November 21, 2005, the company’s Board of
    Directors authorized the purchase of up to $600 million of
    company stock through the end of fiscal 2008. The November 2005
    program was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
    Under the second program, which was announced on March 18,
    2008, the company’s Board of Directors authorized using
    approximately $600 million of the net proceeds from the
    sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business to purchase company
    stock. The March 2008 program was completed during the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition to the publicly announced
    share repurchase programs, the company also purchased shares to
    offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the
    company’s stock compensation plans. Of the 2008
    repurchases, approximately 23 million shares at a cost of
    $800 million were made pursuant to publicly announced share
    repurchase programs. The remaining shares were repurchased to
    offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the
    company’s stock compensation plans.

At August 1, 2010, the company had $835 million of
    short-term borrowings due within one year and $25 million
    of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company.
    The company had a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit
    facility maturing in September 2011, which was unused at
    August 1, 2010, except for $25 million of standby
    letters of credit. In September 2010, the company entered into a
    $975 million committed

364-day

revolving credit facility that contains a one-year term-out
    feature. The company also entered into a $975 million
    revolving credit facility that matures in September 2013. These
    facilities replaced the existing $1.5 billion revolving
    credit facility. These agreements support the company’s
    commercial paper programs.

In November 2008, the company filed a registration statement
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an
    indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration
    statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on
    market conditions.

The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its
    revolving credit facilities and debt securities.

Contractual
    Obligations

The following table summarizes the company’s obligations
    and commitments to make future payments under certain
    contractual obligations. For additional information on debt, see
    Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial



Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered into for
    warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment. Purchase
    commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase
    arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients,
    supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments
    are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other
    long-term liabilities primarily represent payments related to
    deferred compensation obligations. For additional information on
    other long-term liabilities, see Note 19 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments

The company guarantees approximately 1,900 bank loans to
    Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party
    financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The
    maximum potential amount of the future payments the company
    could be required to make under the guarantees is
    $161 million. The company’s guarantees are indirectly
    secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe
    that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee
    payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.
    In connection with the sale of certain Australian salty snack
    food brands and assets, the company agreed to provide a loan
    facility to the buyer of AUD $10 million, or approximately
    USD $9 million. The facility was drawn down in AUD
    $5 million increments in 2009. Borrowings under the
    facility are to be repaid five years after the closing date. See
    also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    information on off-balance sheet arrangements.

Inflation

In fiscal 2008 and 2009, inflation, on average, had been
    significantly higher than in the years preceding 2008, and was
    primarily reflected in Cost of products sold. In 2010, inflation
    was not as significant. The company uses a number of strategies
    to mitigate the effects of cost inflation. These strategies
    include increasing prices, pursuing cost productivity
    initiatives such as global procurement strategies, commodity
    hedging and making capital investments that improve the
    efficiency of operations.



Market
    Risk Sensitivity

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
    commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity
    price changes related to certain deferred compensation
    obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in
    interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and
    fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to
    maintain its

variable-to-total

debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations,
    which accounted for approximately 29% of 2010 net sales,
    are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France,
    Germany and Belgium. The company manages its foreign currency
    exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and
    utilizing cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. Swaps and
    forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with
    related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions
    independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into
    contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged
    instruments.

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders
    and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in
    connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain
    commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters
    into commodity futures and option contracts to reduce the
    volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, wheat, natural
    gas, soybean oil, aluminum, sugar, cocoa, and corn, which impact
    the cost of raw materials.

The information below summarizes the company’s market risks
    associated with debt obligations and other significant financial
    instruments as of August 1, 2010. Fair values included
    herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or
    pricing models using current market rates. The information
    presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 13
    through 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The table below presents principal cash flows and related
    interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations.
    Interest rates disclosed on variable-rate debt maturing in 2010
    represent the weighted-average rates at the period end. Notional
    amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are
    presented by fiscal year of maturity. For the swaps, variable
    rates are the weighted-average forward rates for the term of
    each contract.

As of August 2, 2009, fixed-rate debt of approximately
    $2.2 billion with an average interest rate of 5.50% and
    variable-rate debt of approximately $374 million with an
    average interest rate of 0.58% were outstanding. As of
    August 2, 2009, the company had swapped $500 million
    of fixed-rate debt to variable. The average rate to be



received on these swaps was 4.95% and the average rate paid was
    estimated to be 2.81% over the remaining life of the swaps.

The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk related to its
    international operations, including non-functional currency
    intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries. The
    following table summarizes the cross-currency swaps outstanding
    as of August 1, 2010, which hedge such exposures. The

The cross-currency swap contracts outstanding at August 2,
    2009 represented one pay fixed SEK/receive fixed USD swap with a
    notional value of $32 million, two pay fixed CAD/receive
    fixed USD swaps with notional values totaling $141 million,
    one pay variable CAD/receive variable USD swap with a notional
    value of $37 million, one pay fixed EUR/receive fixed USD
    swap with a notional value totaling $102 million, three pay
    variable EUR/receive variable USD swaps with notional values
    totaling $158 million and two pay variable AUD/receive
    variable USD swaps with notional values totaling
    $249 million. The aggregate notional value of these swap
    contracts was $719 million as of August 2, 2009, and
    the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a loss of
    $35 million as of August 2, 2009.

The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result
    of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency
    of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company
    utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to
    hedge these exposures. The following table summarizes the
    foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related

The company had an additional $14 million in a number of
    smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies,
    such as the Australian dollar, euro, and Japanese yen, as of
    August 1, 2010. The aggregate fair value of all contracts
    was not material as of August 1, 2010. The total forward
    exchange contracts outstanding as of August 2, 2009 were
    $405 million with a fair value loss of $10 million.

The company enters into commodity futures and options contracts
    to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities.
    The notional value of these contracts was $50 million and
    the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of
    $3 million as of August 1, 2010. The total notional
    value of these contracts was $51 million and the aggregate
    fair value was not material as of August 2, 2009.

The company had swap contracts outstanding as of August 1,
    2010, which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain
    deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of
    the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the total return
    of the company’s capital stock and the total return of the
    Puritan Fund. Under these contracts, the company pays variable
    interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index total return, the
    Puritan Fund total return, or the total return on company
    capital stock. The notional value of the contract that is linked
    to the return on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    was $12 million at August 1, 2010 and $8 million
    at August 2, 2009. The average forward interest rate
    applicable to the contract, which expires in 2011, was 0.84% at
    August 1, 2010. The notional value of the contract that is
    linked to the return on the Puritan Fund was $9 million at
    August 1, 2010 and $6 million at August 2, 2009.
    The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract,
    which expires in 2011, was 1.39% at August 1, 2010. The
    notional value of the contract that is linked to the total
    return on company capital stock was $54 million at
    August 1, 2010 and $34 million at August 2, 2009.
    The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract,
    which expires in 2011, was 1.25% at August 1, 2010. The
    fair value of these contracts was a $2 million loss at
    August 1, 2010 and a $4 million gain at August 2,
    2009.

The company’s utilization of financial instruments in
    managing market risk exposures described above is consistent
    with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial
    instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt
    repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign
    currency, and the company’s acquisition and divestiture
    activities.

Significant
    Accounting Estimates

The consolidated financial statements of the company are
    prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. The preparation of these
    financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments
    and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates and
    assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies.
    The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex
    judgments, estimates and assumptions:

Trade and consumer promotion programs

— The
    company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and
    consumers, such as cooperative advertising programs, feature
    price discounts, in-store display incentives and coupons. The
    recognition of the costs for these programs, which are
    classified as a reduction of revenue, involves the use of
    judgment related to performance and redemption estimates.
    Estimates are made based



on historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may
    differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary
    from estimates.

Valuation of long-lived assets

— Fixed assets
    and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as
    events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the
    carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted
    cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment
    exists. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is
    calculated based on estimated fair value.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at
    least annually for impairment, or as events or changes in
    circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the
    asset may not be recoverable.

Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the
    fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value. Fair
    value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The
    discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant
    management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating
    margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic
    and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting
    unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The
    amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying
    value of the goodwill and the “implied” fair value,
    which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been
    acquired and accounted for as a business combination. As of
    August 1, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill was
    $1.919 billion. The company has not recognized any
    impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing, which
    began in 2003. As of the 2010 measurement, the fair value of
    each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 80%.
    Holding all other assumptions used in the 2010 measurement
    constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average
    cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any
    reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by
    comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value.
    Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses
    that include significant management assumptions such as revenue
    growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of
    capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less
    than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value. As
    of August 1, 2010, the carrying value of trademarks was
    $496 million. Holding all other assumptions used in the
    2010 measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the
    weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of
    trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately
    $13 million. In 2009, as part of the company’s annual
    review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of
    $67 million was recognized related to certain European
    trademarks, primarily in Germany and the Nordic region, used in
    the International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment. The
    trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a
    decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced
    expectations for discounted cash flows in comparison to prior
    year. The reduction was due in part to a deterioration in market
    conditions and an increase in the weighted average cost of
    capital. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible
    assets.

The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable
    management judgment and are based upon assumptions about
    expected future operating performance, economic conditions,
    market conditions, and cost of capital. Assumptions used in
    these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. However,
    inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties
    beyond the company’s control, such as capital markets. The
    actual cash flows could differ from management’s estimates
    due to changes in business conditions, operating performance,
    and economic conditions.

Pension and postretirement benefits

— The
    company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to
    employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with
    such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions,
    including discount rates, expected return on plan assets,
    compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend
    rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the
    required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that
    differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated
    and amortized over future periods.

The discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal
    year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate,
    the company reviews published market indices of high-quality
    debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In
    addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield
    curves to the expected benefit



payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a
    long-term assumption based upon historical experience and
    expected future performance, considering the company’s
    current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on
    an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real
    returns for each asset class, and a premium for active
    management. Within any given fiscal period, significant
    differences may arise between the actual return and the expected
    return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the
    calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated
    method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual
    fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. Gains
    and losses resulting from differences between actual experience
    and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If
    the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets
    or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the
    following year.

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was
    $92 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and
    $54 million in 2008. The 2010 expense included
    $12 million of pension settlement costs related to the
    closure of a plant in Canada. The 2008 expense included $2
    million of special termination benefits and curtailment costs
    related to the Godiva divestiture, which was recorded in
    discontinued operations. The 2008 expense also included
    $4 million of special termination and curtailment costs
    related to the restructuring initiatives. Significant
    weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year are as
    follows:




Pension

Discount rate for benefit obligations

5.46

6.00

6.87

Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are
    as follows: a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate
    would increase expense by approximately $12 million; a
    50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets
    assumption would increase expense by approximately
    $10 million. A one percentage point increase in assumed
    health care costs would increase postretirement service and
    interest cost by approximately $1 million.

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to
    increase to approximately $100 million in 2011 primarily
    due to a reduction in the discount rate for benefit obligations
    and increased amortization of unrecognized losses.

Given the adverse impact of declining financial markets on the
    funding levels of the plans, the company contributed
    $260 million to a U.S. plan in 2010. The company made
    a voluntary contribution of $70 million in 2008 to a
    U.S. plan. Contributions to international plans were
    $24 million in 2010, $13 million in 2009, and
    $8 million in 2008. The company contributed
    $100 million to U.S. plans in the first quarter of
    2011. Additional contributions to U.S. plans are not expected in
    2011. Contributions to

non-U.S. plans

are expected to be approximately $43 million in 2011.

See also Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information on pension and postretirement
    expenses.

Income taxes

— The effective tax rate reflects
    statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the
    various jurisdictions in which the company operates and
    management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various
    tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in
    determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax
    positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable
    or payable in the current year and include the effect of
    deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the future impact of differences between the
    financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
    and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss
    and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences
    are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances
    are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely
    than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.



At the beginning of fiscal 2008, the company adopted revised
    accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes. Upon adoption, the company recognized a
    cumulative-effect adjustment of $6 million as an increase
    in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including
    interest and penalties, and a reduction in retained earnings.
    Prior to the adoption, tax reserves were established to reflect
    the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. As of
    August 1, 2010, the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits, including interest and penalties, was $45 million.

See also Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion on income taxes.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In addition to the guidance related to the calculation of
    earnings per share described in “Basis of
    Presentation” and in Note 9 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, recent accounting pronouncements are as
    follows:

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which
    establishes accounting and reporting standards for the
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
    deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It requires a noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary, which was formerly known as minority
    interest, to be classified as a separate component of total
    equity in the consolidated financial statements. The company
    retrospectively adopted the new noncontrolling interest guidance
    in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have a
    material impact on the financial statements. See Note 10 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In January 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative
    guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The
    guidance requires disclosure of details of significant transfers
    in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
    measurements. Level 1 fair value measurements are based on
    unadjusted quoted market prices. Level 2 fair value
    measurements are based on significant inputs, other than
    Level 1, that are observable for the asset/liability
    through corroboration with observable market data. The guidance
    also clarifies the existing disclosure requirements for the
    level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and the
    disclosures on inputs and valuation techniques. The company
    adopted these provisions in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
    The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated
    financial statements. In addition, the guidance requires a gross
    presentation of the activity within the Level 3 roll
    forward, separately presenting information about purchases,
    sales, issuances and settlements. The roll forward information
    must be provided by the company for the first quarter of fiscal
    2012, as the provision is effective for annual reporting periods
    beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim reporting
    periods within those years.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that
    changed the consolidation model for variable interest entities.
    The provisions are effective for the first quarter of fiscal
    2011. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on
    the company’s consolidated financial statements.

See also Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further discussion on new accounting standards.

Cautionary
    Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Report contains “forward-looking” statements that
    reflect the company’s current expectations regarding future
    results of operations, economic performance, financial condition
    and achievements of the company. The company tries, wherever
    possible, to identify these forward-looking statements by using
    words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “estimate,” “expect,” “will” and
    similar expressions. One can also identify them by the fact that
    they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
    These statements reflect the company’s current plans and
    expectations and are based on information currently available to
    it. They rely on a number of assumptions regarding future events
    and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are inherently
    subject to risks and uncertainties.

The company wishes to caution the reader that the following
    important factors and those important factors described in
    Part 1, Item 1A and elsewhere in the commentary, or in
    the Securities and Exchange Commission



filings of the company, could affect the company’s actual
    results and could cause such results to vary materially from
    those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on
    behalf of, the company:

•

the impact of strong competitive response to the company’s
    efforts to leverage its brand power with product innovation,
    promotional programs and new advertising, and of changes in
    consumer demand for the company’s products;

•

the risks in the marketplace associated with trade and consumer
    acceptance of product improvements, shelving initiatives, new
    product introductions, and pricing and promotional strategies;

•

the company’s ability to achieve sales and earnings
    guidance, which is based on assumptions about sales volume,
    product mix, the development and success of new products, the
    impact of marketing and pricing actions, product costs and
    currency;

•

the company’s ability to realize projected cost savings and
    benefits;

•

the company’s ability to successfully manage changes to its
    business processes, including selling, distribution,
    manufacturing, information management systems and the
    integration of acquisitions;

•

the increased significance of certain of the company’s key
    trade customers;

•

the impact of inventory management practices by the
    company’s trade customers;

•

the impact of fluctuations in the supply and inflation in
    energy, raw and packaging materials cost;

•

the impact associated with portfolio changes and completion of
    acquisitions and divestitures;

•

the uncertainties of litigation described from time to time in
    the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings;

•

the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, tax rates,
    interest rates, debt and equity markets, inflation rates,
    economic conditions and other external factors; and

•

the impact of unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of
    the company’s markets due to political instability, civil
    disobedience, armed hostilities, natural disasters or other
    calamities.

This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but
    is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the
    company’s outlook. The company disclaims any obligation or
    intent to update forward-looking statements made by the company
    in order to reflect new information, events or circumstances
    after the date they are made.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(currency in millions, except per share amounts)

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

— The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the company and its
    majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are
    eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior-year
    financial statements were reclassified to conform to the
    current-year presentation. The company’s fiscal year ends
    on the Sunday nearest July 31. There were 52 weeks in
    2010 and 2009, and 53 weeks in 2008.

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850, pursuant to a Sale and
    Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The company has
    reflected the results of this business as discontinued
    operations in the consolidated statements of earnings. See
    Note 3 for additional information on the sale.

Revenue Recognition

— Revenues are recognized
    when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when products
    are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements, title and
    risk of loss transfer to customers, collection is probable and
    pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenues are recognized net of
    provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Certain sales
    promotion expenses, such as coupon redemption costs, cooperative
    advertising programs, new product introduction fees, feature
    price discounts and in-store display incentives, are classified
    as a reduction of sales.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— All highly liquid
    debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
    less are classified as cash equivalents.

Inventories

— All inventories are valued at the
    lower of average cost or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
    and equipment are recorded at historical cost and are
    depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line
    method. Buildings and machinery and equipment are depreciated
    over periods not exceeding 45 years and 20 years,
    respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when
    conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes
    in business climate or a plan of disposal.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

— Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather
    are tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for
    impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur
    indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
    Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the
    estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment. Goodwill
    impairment testing first requires a comparison of the fair value
    of each reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying
    value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is
    considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the
    difference between the carrying value of goodwill and the
    “implied” fair value, which is calculated as if the
    reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a
    business combination. Impairment testing for indefinite-lived
    intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value
    and carrying value of the asset. If carrying value exceeds the
    fair value, the asset is reduced to fair value. Fair values are
    primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses. See
    Note 5 for information on goodwill and other intangible
    assets.

Derivative Financial Instruments

— The company
    uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of
    hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates, interest rates, commodities and equity-linked employee
    benefit obligations. These derivative contracts are entered into
    for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and
    do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The
    company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative
    purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The
    company’s derivative programs include strategies that both
    qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair
    value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the
    company designates the derivative as a hedge of the fair value
    of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment
    (fair-value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of
    the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to
    a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge), or a hedge of
    a net investment in a foreign operation. Some derivatives may
    also be considered natural hedging instruments (changes in fair
    value act as



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

economic offsets to changes in fair value of the underlying
    hedged item) and are not designated for hedge accounting.

Changes in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the
    gain or loss on the underlying hedged asset or liability
    (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in
    current-period earnings. The effective portion of gains and
    losses on cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive
    income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of
    cash flows. If a derivative is used as a hedge of a net
    investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value, to
    the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss). Any ineffective portion of
    designated hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.
    Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated
    for hedge accounting are recognized in current-period earnings.

Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in Net cash
    provided by operating activities.

Use of Estimates

— Generally accepted
    accounting principles require management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect assets and liabilities, contingent
    assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. Actual
    results could differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes

— Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences
    between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for
    operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
    and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
    on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
    is recognized in income in the period that includes the
    enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce
    deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax
    benefit will not be realized.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued authoritative guidance which establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. It requires a noncontrolling interest in a
    subsidiary, which was formerly known as minority interest, to be
    classified as a separate component of total equity in the
    consolidated financial statements. The company retrospectively
    adopted the new noncontrolling interest guidance in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have a material
    impact on the financial statements. See Note 10 for
    additional information.

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for
    business combinations, which establishes the principles and
    requirements for how an acquirer recognizes the assets acquired,
    the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
    acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values
    as of that date with limited exceptions. The guidance requires
    acquisition-related transaction costs to be expensed as incurred
    rather than capitalized as a component of the business
    combination. The provisions as revised were effective as of the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010 and will be applied to any business
    combinations entered into thereafter.

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for
    fair value measurements, which establishes a definition of fair
    value, provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands
    the disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. This
    guidance does not require any new fair value measurements but
    rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that
    require or permit fair value measurements. In February 2008, the
    FASB issued authoritative guidance which delayed by a year the
    effective date for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities.
    The company adopted the provisions of the guidance for financial
    assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The
    adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated
    financial statements. The company adopted the remaining
    provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for nonfinancial
    assets and liabilities, including goodwill and intangible
    assets. The adoption likewise did not have a material impact on
    the consolidated financial statements. See Note 15 for
    additional information.

In January 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative
    guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The
    guidance requires disclosure of details of significant transfers
    in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
    measurements. Level 1 fair value measurements are based on
    unadjusted quoted market prices. Level 2 fair



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

value measurements are based on significant inputs, other than
    Level 1, that are observable for the asset/liability
    through corroboration with observable market data. The guidance
    also clarifies the existing disclosure requirements for the
    level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and the
    disclosures on inputs and valuation techniques. The company
    adopted these provisions in the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
    The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated
    financial statements. In addition, the guidance requires a gross
    presentation of the activity within the Level 3 roll
    forward, separately presenting information about purchases,
    sales, issuances and settlements. The roll forward information
    must be provided by the company for the first quarter of fiscal
    2012, as the provision is effective for annual reporting periods
    beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim reporting
    periods within those years.

In June 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to
    the calculation of earnings per share. The guidance provides
    that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
    (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall
    be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to
    the two-class method. Upon adoption, a company is required to
    retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data (including
    any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings
    and selected financial data) to conform with the new provisions.
    The company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal
    2010. Prior periods have been restated. See Note 9 for
    additional information.

In June 2009, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
    (Codification) was issued to become the source of authoritative
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be
    applied by nongovernmental entities and supersede all
    then-existing non-Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    accounting and reporting standards. Rules and interpretive
    releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws
    are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All
    other nongrandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not
    included in the Codification became nonauthoritative. The
    Codification was effective for financial statements issued for
    interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009.
    The company adopted the provisions in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2010. The adoption did not impact the company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued additional authoritative
    guidance related to employers’ disclosures about the plan
    assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans.
    The required disclosures include a description of how investment
    allocation decisions are made, major categories of plan assets,
    valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan
    assets, the impact of measurements using significant
    unobservable inputs and concentrations of risk within plan
    assets. The disclosures about plan assets required by this
    additional guidance must be provided for fiscal years ending
    after December 15, 2009. The company adopted the provisions
    in fiscal 2010. See Note 11 for additional information.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that
    changed the consolidation model for variable interest entities.
    The provisions are effective for the first quarter of fiscal
    2011. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on
    the company’s consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued
    Operations

On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its
    Godiva Chocolatier business for $850. The purchase price was
    subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in
    an additional $20 of proceeds. The company has reflected the
    results of this business as discontinued operations in the
    consolidated statements of earnings. The company used
    approximately $600 of the net proceeds to purchase company
    stock. The 2008 results included a $462 after-tax gain, or $1.20
    per share, on the Godiva Chocolatier sale. The company
    recognized a $4 benefit in 2009 as a result of an adjustment to
    the tax liability associated with the sale.

In the third quarter of 2008, the company entered into an
    agreement to sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and
    assets. The transaction, which was completed on May 12,
    2008, included the following salty snack brands:

Cheezels

,

Thins

,

Tasty Jacks

,

French
    Fries

, and

Kettle Chips

, certain other assets and the
    assumption of liabilities. Proceeds of the sale were nominal.
    The business was historically included in the Baking and
    Snacking segment and had annual net sales of approximately $150.
    In connection with this transaction, the company recognized a
    pre-tax loss of $120 ($64 after tax or $.17 per share). This
    charge was included in the Restructuring charges on the
    Statements of Earnings in 2008. See also Note 7. The terms
    of the agreement required the company to provide a loan facility
    to the buyer of AUD $10, or approximately USD $9. The facility
    was drawn down in AUD $5 increments in 2009. Borrowings under
    the facility are to be repaid five years after the closing date.

In July 2008, the company entered into an agreement to sell its
    sauce and mayonnaise business comprised of products sold under
    the

Lesieur

brand in France. The company recorded a
    pre-tax impairment charge of $2 to adjust the net assets to
    estimated realizable value in 2008. The sale was completed on
    September 29, 2008 and resulted in $36 of proceeds. The
    purchase price was subject to working capital and other
    post-closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional $6 of
    proceeds. The business was historically included in the
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment and had annual
    net sales of approximately $70.

The company has provided certain indemnifications in connection
    with the divestitures. As of August 1, 2010, known
    exposures related to such matters are not material.

intangible assets consist of trademarks. Amortizable intangible

Amortization was less than $1 in 2010, 2009, and 2008. The
    estimated aggregated amortization expense for each of the five
    succeeding fiscal years is less than $1 per year. Asset useful
    lives range from ten to twenty years.

In 2009, as part of the company’s annual review of
    intangible assets, an impairment charge of $67 was recognized
    related to certain European trademarks, primarily in Germany and
    the Nordic region, used in the International Soup, Sauces and
    Beverages segment. The trademarks were determined to be impaired
    as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands,
    resulting from reduced expectations for discounted cash flows in
    comparison to prior year. The reduction was due in part to a
    deterioration in market conditions and an increase in the
    weighted average cost of capital.

In May 2009, the company acquired Ecce Panis, Inc. Intangible
    assets from the acquisition totaled $16. See Note 8 for
    additional information.

In 2008, the company recognized an impairment charge of $4
    related to the performance of certain trademarks used in the
    International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment.

Restructuring
    Charges

On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of
    initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long-term
    profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands
    and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities
    in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the company’s
    management structure. As a result of these initiatives, in 2008,
    the company recorded a restructuring charge of $175 ($102 after
    tax or $.27 per share). The charge consisted of a net loss of
    $120 ($64 after tax) on the sale of certain Australian salty
    snack food brands and assets; $45 ($31 after tax) of employee
    severance and benefit costs, including the estimated impact of
    curtailment and other pension charges; and $10 ($7 after tax) of
    property, plant and equipment impairment charges. In addition,
    approximately $7 ($5 after tax or $.01 per share) of costs
    related to these initiatives were recorded in Cost of products
    sold, primarily representing accelerated depreciation on
    property, plant and equipment. The aggregate after-tax impact of
    restructuring charges and related costs in 2008 was $107, or
    $.28 per share.

In 2009, the company recorded approximately $22 ($15 after tax
    or $.04 per share) of costs related to the 2008 initiatives in
    Cost of products sold. Approximately $17 ($12 after tax) of the
    costs represented accelerated depreciation on property, plant
    and equipment; approximately $4 ($2 after tax) related to other
    exit costs; and approximately $1 related to employee severance
    and benefit costs, including other pension charges.

In 2010, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $12 ($8
    after tax or $.02 per share) for pension benefit costs, which
    represented the final costs associated with the 2008 initiatives.

Of the aggregate $216 of pre-tax costs for the total program,
    approximately $40 were cash expenditures, the majority of which
    was spent in 2009.

Details of the components of the initiatives are as follows:

In the third quarter of 2008, as part of the initiatives, the
    company entered into an agreement to sell certain Australian
    salty snack food brands and assets. The transaction was
    completed on May 12, 2008. Proceeds of the sale were
    nominal. See also Note 3.

In April 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company announced
    plans to close the Listowel, Ontario, Canada food plant. The
    Listowel facility produced primarily frozen products, including
    soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm products, as well as ramen
    noodles. The facility employed approximately 500 people.
    The company closed the facility in April 2009. Production was
    transitioned to its network of North American contract
    manufacturers and to its Downingtown, Pennsylvania plant. The
    company recorded $20 ($14 after tax) of employee severance and
    benefit costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and
    other pension charges, and $7 ($5 after tax) in accelerated



NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

depreciation of property, plant and equipment in 2008. In 2009,
    the company recorded $1 of employee severance and benefit costs,
    including other pension charges, $16 ($11 after tax) in
    accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment and $2
    ($1 after tax) of other exit costs. In 2010, the company
    recorded a restructuring charge of $12 ($8 after tax) for
    pension benefit costs, which represented the final costs
    associated with the initiatives.

In April 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company also
    announced plans to discontinue the private label biscuit and
    industrial chocolate production at its Miranda, Australia
    facility. The company closed the Miranda facility, which
    employed approximately 150 people, in the second quarter of
    2009. In connection with this action, the company recorded $10
    ($7 after tax) of property, plant and equipment impairment
    charges and $8 ($6 after tax) in employee severance and benefit
    costs in 2008. In 2009, the company recorded $1 in accelerated
    depreciation of property, plant, and equipment, and $2 ($1 after
    tax) in other exit costs.

As part of the 2008 initiatives, the company streamlined its
    management structure and eliminated certain overhead costs.
    These actions began in the fourth quarter of 2008 and were
    substantially completed in 2009. In connection with this action,
    the company recorded $17 ($11 after tax) in employee severance
    and benefit costs in 2008.

    sales, net earnings or earnings per share for the prior periods
    would not have been material. As part of the purchase price
    allocation, $46 was allocated to intangible assets primarily

Earnings
    per Share

In June 2008, the FASB issued accounting guidance related to the
    calculation of earnings per share. The guidance provides that
    unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable
    rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or
    unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in
    the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class
    method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula
    that determines earnings per share for each class of common
    stock and participating security according to dividends declared
    and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The company
    adopted and retrospectively applied the new guidance in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010. The retrospective application of
    the provisions resulted in a reduction of basic and diluted
    earnings per share:

    were less than $1 in 2010, 2009, and 2008, and were included in

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

Pension Benefits

— Substantially all of the
    company’s U.S. and certain

non-U.S. employees

are covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. In
    1999, the company implemented significant amendments to certain
    U.S. plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are
    determined based on percentages of annual pay and



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

age. To minimize the impact of converting to the new formula,
    service and earnings credit continues to accrue for active
    employees participating in the plans under the formula prior to
    the amendments through the year 2014. Employees will receive the
    benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher.
    Benefits become vested upon the completion of three years of
    service. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to
    trustees and insurance companies or are paid directly by the
    company from general funds. In 2010, the company amended its
    U.S. pension plans. Employees hired or rehired on or after
    January 1, 2011 and who are not covered by collective
    bargaining agreements will not be eligible to participate in the
    plans.

Postretirement Benefits

— The company provides
    postretirement benefits including health care and life insurance
    to substantially all retired U.S. employees and their
    dependents. In 1999, changes were made to the postretirement
    benefits offered to certain U.S. employees. Participants
    who were not receiving postretirement benefits as of May 1,
    1999 will no longer be eligible to receive such benefits in the
    future, but the company will provide access to health care
    coverage for non-eligible future retirees on a group basis.
    Costs will be paid by the participants. To preserve the economic
    benefits for employees near retirement as of May 1, 1999,
    participants who were at least age 55 and had at least
    10 years of continuous service remain eligible for
    postretirement benefits.

In 2005, the company established retiree medical account
    benefits for eligible U.S. retirees, intended to provide
    reimbursement for eligible health care expenses. In 2010, the
    retirement medical program was amended to discontinue retiree
    medical accounts for employees not covered by collective
    bargaining agreements and who are not at least age 50 with
    at least 10 years of service as of December 31, 2010.

The company uses the fiscal year end as the measurement date for
    the benefit plans.

The changes in other comprehensive loss associated with pension
    benefits included the reclassification of actuarial losses into
    earnings of $49 and $19 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    remaining changes in other comprehensive loss associated with
    pension benefits were primarily due to net actuarial losses
    arising during the period. The change in other comprehensive
    income associated with postretirement benefits in 2010 included
    $50 of net actuarial losses arising during the period and $18 of
    prior service credit. The change in other comprehensive income
    associated with postretirement benefits in 2009 was primarily
    due to $19 of net actuarial losses arising during the period.

The discount rate is established as of the company’s fiscal

    the company reviews published market indices of high-quality
    debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In
    addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield
    curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The
    expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based
    upon historical experience and expected future performance,
    considering the company’s current and projected investment
    mix.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation,

Pension
    Plan Assets

The fundamental goal underlying the investment policy is to
    ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent
    manner to meet the obligations of the plans as these obligations
    come due. The primary investment objectives include providing a
    total return which will promote the goal of benefit security by
    attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan
    obligations, to provide for real asset growth while also
    tracking plan obligations, to diversify investments across and
    within asset classes, to reduce the impact of losses in single
    investments, and to follow investment practices that comply with
    applicable laws and regulations.

The primary policy objectives will be met by investing assets to
    achieve a reasonable tradeoff between return and risk relative
    to the plans’ obligations. This includes investing a
    portion of the assets in funds selected in part to hedge the
    interest rate sensitivity to plan obligations.

The portfolio includes investments in the following asset
    classes: fixed income, equity, real estate and alternatives.
    Fixed income will provide a moderate expected return and
    partially hedge the exposure to interest rate risk of the
    plans’ obligations. Equities are used for their high
    expected return. Additional asset classes are used to provide
    diversification.

Asset allocation is monitored on an ongoing basis relative to
    the established asset class targets. The interaction between
    plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to
    assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation
    targets. The investment policy permits variances from the
    targets within certain parameters. Asset rebalancing occurs when
    the underlying asset class allocations move outside these
    parameters at which time the asset allocation is rebalanced back
    to the policy target weight.

Short-term investments

— Investments include
    cash and cash equivalents, and various short-term debt
    instruments and short-term investment funds. Institutional
    short-term investment vehicles valued daily are classified as
    Level 1 at cost which approximates market value. Other
    investment vehicles are valued based upon a net asset value and
    are classified as Level 2.

Equities

— Common stocks and preferred stocks
    are classified as Level 1 and are valued using quoted
    market prices in active markets. Investments in commingled funds
    are classified as Level 2 assets as the funds are not
    traded in active markets. Commingled funds are valued based on
    the unit values of such funds. Unit values are based on the fair
    value of the underlying assets of the funds derived from inputs
    principally based on quoted market prices in an active market or
    corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other
    means.

Corporate bonds

— These investments are valued
    based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models
    using current market rates.

Government and agency bonds

— These investments
    are generally valued based on bid quotations and recent trade
    data for identical or similar obligations.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Mortgage and asset backed securities

— Fair
    value is based on prices obtained from third party pricing
    sources. The prices from third party pricing sources may be
    based on bid quotes from dealers and recent trade data. Mortgage
    backed securities are traded in the over the counter market.

Real estate

— Real estate investments consist
    of real estate investment trusts and property funds. Real estate
    investment trusts are classified as Level 1 and are valued
    based on quoted market prices. Property funds are classified as
    either Level 2 or Level 3 depending upon whether
    liquidity is limited or there are few observable market
    participant transactions. Fair value is based on third party
    appraisals.

Limited partnerships

— Investments in limited
    partnerships are valued based upon valuations provided by the
    general partners of the funds. The values of limited
    partnerships are based upon an assessment of each underlying
    investment, incorporating valuations that consider the
    evaluation of financing and sales transactions with third
    parties, expected cash flows, and market-based information,
    including comparable transactions and performance multiples
    among other factors. The investments are classified as
    Level 3 since the valuation is determined using
    unobservable inputs.

Hedge funds

— Hedge fund investments include
    hedge funds valued based upon a net asset value derived from the
    fair value of underlying securities and are therefore classified
    as Level 2 assets. Hedge fund investments may include long
    and short positions in equity and fixed income securities,
    derivative instruments such as futures and options, commodities,
    and other types of securities.

Guaranteed insurance contracts

— These assets
    are classified as Level 3 assets as they are valued using
    unobservable inputs. Guaranteed insurance contracts are valued
    based on the discounted stream of guaranteed benefit payments at
    a market rate increased for expected future profit sharing. The
    expected excess return is equal to expected indexation granted
    to participants. The discounted stream of guaranteed benefit
    payments is calculated based on the expected mortality rates of
    plan participants.

Other items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets included
    net accrued interest and dividends receivable, amounts due for
    securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased, and
    other payables.

Savings Plan

— The company sponsors employee
    savings plans which cover substantially all U.S. employees.
    The company provides a matching contribution of 60% (50% at
    certain locations) of the employee contributions up to 5% of
    compensation after one year of continued service. Amounts
    charged to Costs and expenses were $17 in 2010, and $18 in both
    2009 and 2008.

Effective January 1, 2011, the company will provide a
    matching contribution of 100% of employee contributions up to 4%
    of compensation for employees who are not covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. Employees hired or rehired on or after
    January 1, 2011 who will not be eligible to participate in
    the defined benefit plans and who are not covered by collective
    bargaining agreements will receive a contribution equal to 3% of

In the third quarter of 2010, the company recorded deferred tax
    expense of $10 due to the enactment of U.S. health care
    legislation in March 2010. The law changed the tax treatment of
    subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits
    to retirees. Accordingly, the company recorded the non-cash
    charge to reduce the value of the deferred tax asset associated
    with the subsidy.

In the second and third quarters of 2010, the company recorded a
    tax benefit of $9 following the finalization of tax audits. The
    company recorded an additional tax benefit of $2 during the year
    related to the resolution of other tax contingencies.

In the first quarter of 2009, the company recorded a tax benefit
    of $11 following the finalization of tax audits.

In the second quarter of 2008, the company recorded a tax
    benefit of $13 resulting from the resolution of a state tax
    contingency.

allowances have been established to offset $89 of these tax loss
    carryforwards. Additionally, at August 1, 2010,

non-U.S. subsidiaries

of the company have capital loss carryforwards of approximately
    $336, which are fully offset by valuation allowances.

The net change in the valuation allowance in 2010 was an
    increase of $15. The increase was primarily due to the impact of
    currency and the recognition of additional valuation allowances
    on foreign loss carryforwards that are not expected to be
    utilized prior to the expiration date. The net change in the
    valuation allowance in 2009 was a decrease of $7, primarily due
    to currency. The net change in the valuation allowance in 2008
    was an increase of $79. The increase was primarily due to
    establishing a $72 valuation allowance for an increase in
    capital loss carryforwards generated by the divestiture of the
    Australian snack food brands.

As of August 1, 2010, U.S. income taxes have not been
    provided on approximately $605 of undistributed earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries,

which are deemed to be permanently reinvested. It is not
    practical to estimate the tax liability that might be incurred
    if such earnings were remitted to the U.S.

The company adopted the provisions related to accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes as of July 30, 2007 (the
    beginning of fiscal 2008). Upon adoption, the company recognized
    a cumulative-effect adjustment of $6 as an increase in the
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and
    penalties, and a corresponding reduction in retained earnings. A
    reconciliation of the activity related to unrecognized tax
    benefits follows:

As of August 1, 2010, August 2, 2009, and
    August 3, 2008, there were $22, $28, and $37, respectively,
    of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the
    annual effective tax rate. The total amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits can change due to audit settlements, tax examination
    activities, statute expirations and the recognition and
    measurement criteria under accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes. The company is unable to estimate what this change could
    be within the next twelve months, but does not believe it would
    be material to the financial statements.

The company’s accounting policy with respect to interest
    and penalties attributable to income taxes is to reflect any
    expense or benefit as a component of its income tax provision.
    The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the
    Statements of Earnings was an expense of $2 in 2010 and a
    benefit of $1 and $4, respectively for 2009 and 2008. The total
    amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets as of August 1, 2010 and August 2, 2009
    was $9 and $8, respectively.

None of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, including
    interest and penalties, are expected to be settled within the
    next twelve months. The $45 and $50 of unrecognized tax benefit
    liabilities, including interest and penalties, are reported as
    other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
    as of August 1, 2010 and August 2, 2009, respectively.

The company does business globally and, as a result, files
    income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
    various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of
    business, the company is subject to examination by taxing
    authorities throughout the world, including such major
    jurisdictions as the United States, Australia, Canada, Belgium,
    France and Germany. The 2010 tax year is currently under audit
    by the IRS. In addition, several state income tax examinations
    are in progress for fiscal years 2001 to 2009.



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The company has been notified of a limited scope audit in
    Australia for fiscal years 2007 through 2009. With limited
    exceptions, the company has been audited for income tax purposes
    in Canada and France through fiscal year 2005 and in Belgium and
    Germany through fiscal year 2007.

    and amounts related to interest rate swaps designated as
    fair-value hedges. For additional information on fair-value
    interest rate swaps, see Note 14.

In July 2010, the company issued $400 of 3.05% notes which
    mature on July 15, 2017. Interest on the notes is due
    semi-annually on January 15 and July 15, commencing on
    January 15, 2011. The company may redeem the notes in whole
    or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the
    principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed to
    ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early
    redemption.

In July 2009, the company issued $300 of 3.375% notes which
    mature on August 15, 2014. Interest on the notes is due
    semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing on
    February 15, 2010. The company may redeem the notes in
    whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of
    the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed
    to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early
    redemption.

In January 2009, the company issued $300 of 4.50% notes
    which mature on February 15, 2019. Interest on the notes is
    due semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing
    on August 15, 2009. The company may redeem the notes in
    whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of
    the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed
    to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early
    redemption.

The fair value of the company’s long-term debt, including
    the current portion of long-term debt in Short-term borrowings,
    was $2,829 at August 1, 2010 and $2,394 at August 2,
    2009.

In November 2008, the company filed a registration statement
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an
    indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration
    statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on
    market conditions.

Principal amounts of debt mature as follows: 2011-$832 (in
    current liabilities); 2012-$2; 2013-$400; 2014-$300; 2015-$300
    and beyond-$900.

14.

Financial
    Instruments

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate
    fair value. The fair value of long-term debt as indicated in
    Note 13 is based on quoted market prices or pricing models
    using current market rates.

The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and
    commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity
    price changes related to certain deferred compensation
    obligations. In order to manage these exposures, the company
    follows established risk management policies and procedures,
    including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps,
    forwards and commodity futures and option contracts. These
    derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent
    with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute
    positions independent of those exposures. The company does not
    enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and
    does not use leveraged instruments. The company’s
    derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do
    not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

The company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to
    derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual
    obligations. The company minimizes the counterparty credit risk
    on these transactions by dealing only with leading,
    credit-worthy financial institutions having long-term credit
    ratings of “A” or better. In addition, the contracts
    are distributed among several financial institutions, thus
    minimizing credit-risk concentration. The company does not have
    credit-risk-related contingent features in its derivative
    instruments as of August 1, 2010.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Risk

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related
    to its international operations, including non-functional
    currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries.
    The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result
    of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency
    of certain



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

subsidiaries. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward
    purchase and sale contracts as well as cross-currency swaps to
    hedge these exposures. The contracts are either designated as
    cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. The company
    typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency
    transaction exposure with foreign exchange forward contracts for
    up to 18 months. To hedge currency exposures related to
    intercompany debt, cross-currency swap contracts are entered
    into for periods consistent with the underlying debt. As of
    August 1, 2010, cross-currency swap contracts mature in
    2011 through 2015. Principal currencies hedged include the
    Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Swedish krona, New
    Zealand dollar, British pound and Japanese yen. The notional
    amount of foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap
    contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges was $261 and $322 at
    August 1, 2010 and August 2, 2009, respectively. The
    effective portion of the changes in fair value on these
    instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and
    is reclassified into the Statements of Earnings on the same line
    item and same period in which the underlying hedge transaction
    affects earnings. The notional amount of foreign exchange
    forward and cross-currency swap contracts that are not
    designated as accounting hedges was $757 and $802 at
    August 1, 2010 and August 2, 2009, respectively.

Interest
    Rate Risk

The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by
    optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by
    utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its

variable-to-total

debt ratio within targeted guidelines. Receive fixed rate/pay
    variable rate interest rate swaps are accounted for as
    fair-value hedges. The notional amount of outstanding fair-value
    interest rate swaps at August 1, 2010 and August 2,
    2009 totaled $500.

During fiscal 2010, the company entered into forward starting
    interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges
    with a combined notional value of $200 to hedge a July 2010
    anticipated debt offering. These swaps were settled concurrent
    with the July 2010 debt issuance of $400 seven-year
    3.05% notes at a loss of $14, which was recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss). The loss on the swap contracts will
    be amortized over the life of the debt as additional interest
    expense.

In June 2008, the company entered into two forward starting
    interest rate swap contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges
    with a combined notional value of $200 to hedge an anticipated
    debt offering in fiscal 2009. These swaps were settled as of
    November 2, 2008, at a loss of $13, which was recorded in
    other comprehensive income (loss). In January 2009, the company
    issued $300 ten-year 4.50% notes. The loss on the swap
    contracts will be amortized over the life of the debt as
    additional interest expense.

Commodity
    Price Risk

The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders
    and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in
    connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain
    commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters
    into commodity futures and options contracts to reduce the
    volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, wheat, natural
    gas, soybean oil, aluminum, sugar, cocoa, and corn, which impact
    the cost of raw materials. Commodity futures and option
    contracts are typically accounted for as cash-flow hedges or are
    not designated as accounting hedges. Commodity futures and
    option contracts are typically entered into to hedge a portion
    of commodity requirements for periods up to 18 months. The
    notional amount of commodity contracts accounted for as
    cash-flow hedges was $7 at August 1, 2010 and
    August 2, 2009. The notional amount of commodity contracts
    that are not designated as accounting hedges was $43 and $44 at
    August 1, 2010 and August 2, 2009, respectively. As of
    August 1, 2010, the contracts mature within 12 months.

Equity
    Price Risk

The company hedges a portion of exposures relating to certain
    deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of
    the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the total return
    of the company’s capital stock and the total return of the
    Puritan Fund. Under these contracts, the company pays variable
    interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the
    total return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
    the total return of the Puritan Fund, or the total return on
    company capital stock. These instruments are not designated as
    hedges for accounting purposes. The contracts are

typically entered into for periods not exceeding 12 months.
    The notional amounts of the company’s deferred compensation
    hedges as of August 1, 2010 and August 2, 2009 were
    $75 and $48, respectively.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The company is required to categorize financial assets and
    liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices
    (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active
    markets.

•

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in
    Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability
    through corroboration with observable market data.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions.

Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that
    would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    as of the measurement date. When available, the company uses
    unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair value and
    classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices
    are not available, the company bases fair value upon internally
    developed models that use current market-based or independently
    sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency
    rates.

The company has authorized 560 million shares of Capital
    stock with $.0375 par value and 40 million shares of
    Preferred stock, issuable in one or more classes, with or
    without par as may be authorized by the Board of Directors. No
    Preferred stock has been issued.

Share
    Repurchase Programs

In November 2005, the company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the purchase of up to $600 of company stock through
    fiscal 2008. This program was completed during the third quarter
    of 2008. In March 2008, the company’s Board of Directors
    authorized using approximately $600 of the net proceeds from the
    sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business to purchase company
    stock. This program was completed during the fourth quarter of
    2008. In June 2008,



NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of
    up to $1,200 of company stock through fiscal 2011. This program
    began in fiscal 2009. In addition to these publicly announced
    programs, the company repurchases shares to offset the impact of
    dilution from shares issued under the company’s stock
    compensation plans.

In 2010, the company repurchased 14 million shares at a
    cost of $472. Of the 2010 repurchases, approximately
    7 million shares at a cost of $250 were made pursuant to
    the company’s June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase
    program. Approximately $550 remained available under this
    program as of August 1, 2010.

In 2009, the company repurchased 17 million shares at a
    cost of $527. Of the 2009 repurchases, approximately

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In 2003, shareowners approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan,
    which authorized the issuance of 28 million shares to
    satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including
    performance restricted stock) and performance units.
    Approximately 3.2 million shares available under a previous
    long-term plan were rolled into the 2003 Long-Term Incentive
    Plan, making the total number of available shares approximately
    31.2 million. In November 2005, shareowners approved the
    2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of
    an additional 6 million shares to satisfy the same types of
    awards.

Awards under the 2003 and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans may be
    granted to employees and directors. The term of a stock option
    granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date
    of grant. Options granted under these plans vest cumulatively
    over a three-year period at a rate of 30%, 60% and 100%,
    respectively. The option price may not be less than the fair
    market value of a share of common stock on the date of the
    grant. Restricted stock granted in fiscal 2004 and 2005 vests in
    three annual installments of


/


each, beginning


/


years
    from the date of grant.

Pursuant to the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, in July 2005 the
    company adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which
    provides for grants of total shareowner return (TSR) performance
    restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units,
    and time-lapse restricted stock/units. Initial grants made in
    accordance with this program were approved in September 2005.
    Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted
    stock/units will be earned by comparing the company’s total
    shareowner return during a three-year period to the respective
    total shareowner returns of companies in a performance peer
    group. Based upon the company’s ranking in the performance
    peer group, a recipient of TSR performance restricted
    stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 225% of
    the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted
    stock/units will be earned based upon the company’s
    achievement of annual earnings per share goals. During the
    three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance
    restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to
    100% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted
    stock/units will vest ratably over the three-year period. Annual
    stock option grants are not part of the long-term incentive
    compensation program for 2008, 2009, and 2010. However, stock
    options may still be granted on a selective basis under the 2003
    and 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans.

Total pre-tax stock-based compensation recognized in Earnings
    from continuing operations was $88 for 2010, $84 for 2009, and
    $83 for 2008. Tax related benefits of $33 were recognized for
    2010 and $31 were recognized for 2009 and 2008. Stock-based
    compensation associated with 2008 discontinued operations was $3
    after-tax.

The fair value of time-lapse restricted stock/units and EPS
    performance restricted stock/units is determined based on the
    number of shares granted and the quoted price of the
    company’s stock at the date of grant. Time-lapse restricted
    stock/units granted in fiscal 2006 and forward are expensed on a
    straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards
    issued to retirement-eligible participants, which are expensed
    on an accelerated basis. EPS performance restricted stock/units
    are expensed on a graded-vesting basis, except for awards issued
    to retirement-eligible participants, which are expensed on an
    accelerated basis.

As of August 1, 2010, total remaining unearned compensation
    related to nonvested time-lapse restricted stock/units and EPS
    performance restricted stock/units was $35, which will be
    amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of
    1.7 years. The fair value of restricted stock/units vested
    during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $32, $47, and $70, respectively.
    The weighted-average grant-date fair value of restricted
    stock/units granted during 2009 and 2008 was $39.50 and $36.57,
    respectively.

The fair value of TSR performance restricted stock/units is
    estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation.
    Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service
    period. As of August 1, 2010, total remaining unearned
    compensation related to TSR performance restricted stock/units
    was $54, which will be amortized over the weighted-average
    remaining service period of 1.7 years. In the first quarter
    of fiscal 2010, recipients of TSR performance restricted
    stock/units earned 85% of their initial grants based upon the
    company’s total shareowner return ranking in a performance
    peer group during a three-year period ended July 31, 2009.
    As a result, approximately 165,000 shares were forfeited.
    The total fair value of TSR performance restricted stock/units
    vested during 2010 and 2009 was $31 and $58, respectively. The
    grant-date fair value of TSR performance restricted stock/units
    granted during 2009 and 2008 was $47.20 and $34.64, respectively.

Prior to fiscal 2009, employees could elect to defer all types
    of restricted stock awards. These awards are classified as
    liabilities because of the possibility that they may be settled
    in cash. The fair value is adjusted quarterly. The total cash
    paid to settle the liabilities in 2010, 2009, and 2008 was not
    material. The liability for deferred awards was $7 at
    August 1, 2010.

The excess tax benefits on the exercise of stock options and
    vested restricted stock presented as cash flows from financing
    activities in 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $11, $18, and $8,
    respectively. Cash received from the exercise of stock options
    was $139, $72, and $47 for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively,
    and is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The company is a party to legal proceedings and claims arising
    out of the normal course of business.

Management assesses the probability of loss for all legal
    proceedings and claims and has recognized liabilities for such
    contingencies, as appropriate. Although the results of these
    matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in management’s
    opinion, the final outcome of legal proceedings and claims will
    not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results
    of operations or financial condition of the company.

The company has certain operating lease commitments, primarily
    related to warehouse and office facilities, retail store space
    and certain equipment. Rent expense under operating lease
    commitments was $48 in 2010, $47 in 2009, and $80 in 2008. Rent
    expense in 2008 included $33 related to discontinued operations.
    Future minimum annual rental payments under these operating
    leases are as follows:

The company guarantees approximately 1,900 bank loans made to
    Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party
    financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes.
    The maximum potential amount of future payments the company
    could be required to make under the guarantees is $161. The
    company’s guarantees are indirectly secured by the
    distribution routes. The company does not believe it is probable
    that it will

be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults
    on the bank loans guaranteed. The amounts recognized as of
    August 1, 2010 and August 2, 2009 were not material.

In connection with the sale of certain Australian salty snack
    food brands and assets, the company agreed to provide a loan
    facility to the buyer of AUD $10, or approximately USD $9. The
    facility was drawn down in AUD $5 increments in 2009. Borrowings
    under the facility are to be repaid five years after the closing
    date.

The company has provided certain standard indemnifications in
    connection with divestitures, contracts and other transactions.
    Certain indemnifications have finite expiration dates.
    Liabilities recognized based on known exposures related to such
    matters were not material at August 1, 2010.

Depreciation expense was $251 in 2010, $264 in 2009, and $288 in

The deferred compensation obligation represents unfunded plans
    maintained for the purpose of providing the company’s
    directors and certain of its executives the opportunity to defer
    a portion of their compensation. All forms of compensation
    contributed to the deferred compensation plans are accounted for
    in accordance with the underlying program. Contributions are
    credited to an investment account in the participant’s
    name, although no funds are actually contributed to the
    investment account and no investment choices are actually
    purchased. Six investment choices are available, including:
    (1) a book account that tracks the total return on company
    stock; (2) a book account that tracks performance of
    Fidelity’s Spartan U.S. Equity Index Fund; (3) a book
    account that tracks the performance of Fidelity’s Puritan
    Fund; (4) a book account that tracks the performance of
    Fidelity’s Spartan International Index Fund; (5) a
    book account that tracks the performance of Fidelity’s
    Spartan Extended Market Index Fund; and (6) a book account
    that credits interest based on the Wall Street Journal indexed
    prime rate. Participants can reallocate investments daily and
    are entitled to the gains and losses on investment funds. The
    company recognizes an amount in the Statements of Earnings for
    the market appreciation/depreciation of each fund.

Reports
    of Management

Management’s
    Report on Financial Statements

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the
    company’s management in conformity with generally accepted
    accounting principles to reflect the financial position of the
    company and its operating results. The financial information
    appearing throughout this Annual Report is consistent with the
    financial statements. Management is responsible for the
    information and representations in such financial statements,
    including the estimates and judgments required for their
    preparation. The financial statements have been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
    entirely of Directors who are not officers or employees of the
    company, meets regularly with the company’s worldwide
    internal auditing department, other management personnel, and
    the independent auditors. The independent auditors and the
    internal auditing department have had, and continue to have,
    direct access to the Audit Committee without the presence of
    other management personnel, and have been directed to discuss
    the results of their audit work and any matters they believe
    should be brought to the Committee’s attention. The
    internal auditing department and the independent auditors report
    directly to the Audit Committee.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
    America.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
    only in accordance with authorizations of management and
    Directors of the company; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
    the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
    the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    August 1, 2010. In making this assessment, management used
    the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on this
    assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of August 1, 2010.



The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of August 1, 2010 has been audited
    by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareowners and Directors of Campbell Soup Company

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
    the related consolidated statements of earnings, of equity and
    of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of Campbell Soup Company and its subsidiaries
    at August 1, 2010 and August 2, 2009, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    fiscal years in the period ended August 1, 2010 in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of August 1, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 9 and Note 12 to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it
    accounts for unvested share-based payment awards that contain
    non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents in
    the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class
    method in 2010 and the manner in which it accounts for uncertain
    tax positions in 2008.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Controls
    and Procedures

The company, under the supervision and with the participation of
    its management, including the President and Chief Executive
    Officer and Senior Vice President — Chief Financial
    Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)) as of August 1, 2010 (the
    “Evaluation Date”). Based on such evaluation, the
    President and Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice
    President — Chief Financial Officer and Chief
    Administrative Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation
    Date, the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are
    effective.

The annual report of management on the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is provided under
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” on
    page 74. The attestation report of PricewaterhouseCoopers
    LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, regarding the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting is provided under “Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data” on page 76.

During the quarter ended August 1, 2010, as part of the
    previously announced SAP enterprise-resource planning system
    implementation, the company implemented SAP software at its
    Everett, Washington, and its Marleston, South Australia,
    manufacturing facilities. In conjunction with this SAP
    implementation, the company modified the design, operation and
    documentation of its internal control over financial reporting.
    Specifically, the company modified controls in the business
    processes impacted by the new system, such as user access
    security, system reporting and authorization and reconciliation
    procedures. There were no other changes in the company’s
    internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, such
    internal control over financial reporting.
