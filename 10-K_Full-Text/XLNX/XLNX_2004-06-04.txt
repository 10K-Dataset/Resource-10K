ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company) designs, develops and markets complete programmable logic solutions, including advanced integrated circuits (ICs), software design
tools, predefined system functions delivered as intellectual property (IP) cores, design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. The programmable logic devices (PLDs)
include field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs). These devices are standard products that our customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our
products are designed to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers primarily in the communications, storage, server, consumer,
industrial and other markets. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors, through direct sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by a network of
independent sales representative firms and through a direct sales management organization.

Xilinx
was founded in California in February 1984. In April 1990, the Company reincorporated in Delaware. Our corporate facilities and executive offices are located at 2100 Logic Drive,
San Jose, California 95124, and our website address is www.xilinx.com.

Industry Overview

There are three principal types of ICs used in most digital electronic systems: processors, which generally are utilized for control and computing tasks; memory devices, which
are used for storing program instructions and data; and logic devices, which generally are used to manage the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system. Almost every electronic
system contains application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which include custom gate arrays, standard cells and programmable logic. These devices all compete with each other since they may be
utilized in the same types of applications within electronic systems. However, variables in pricing, product performance, reliability, power consumption, density, adaptability, ease of use and
time-to-market determine the degree to which the devices compete for specific applications.

Programmable
logic has a primary advantage over custom gate arrays and standard cells in that it enables faster time-to-market with shorter design cycles. Users of PLDs can
program their design directly into the PLD, using software, thereby allowing customers to revise their designs relatively quickly with lower development costs. Since PLDs are programmable, they
typically have a larger die size resulting in higher costs per unit compared to custom gate arrays and standard cells, which are customized with a fixed function during wafer fabrication. Custom gate
arrays and standard cells, however, generally require longer fabrication lead times and higher up-front costs than PLDs.

PLDs
are standard components. This means that the same device type can be sold to many different customers for many different applications. As a result, the development cost of PLDs can be spread over
a large number of customers. Custom gate arrays and standard cells, on the other hand, are custom chips for an individual customer for use in a specific application. This involves a high
up-front cost to customers. Technology advances are enabling PLD companies to reduce costs considerably, making PLDs an increasingly attractive alternative to custom gate arrays and
standard cells.

Products

Integral to the future success of our business is the timely introduction of new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively with respect to price,
functionality and performance. Software design tools, IP cores, technical support and design services are also critical components that enable our customers to implement their design specifications
into our PLDs. Altogether, these products form a comprehensive programmable logic solution. A brief overview of these products follows. Our product families mentioned in the table below are not
all inclusive but they comprise the majority of revenues. They are our newest product families and are currently being designed into our customers' next generation products. Some of our more mature

Virtex FPGAs

The Virtex-II Pro FPGA family consists of nine members. The family has up to two IBM PowerPC™ processors, up to 20 Rocket I/O™ multi-gigabit
transceivers, up to eight megabits of embedded memory, embedded software design tools and operating system support. Virtex-II Pro devices are delivered on 300mm wafers employing
130-nanometer copper process technology. The Virtex-II Pro solution enables ultra-high bandwidth system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs
that were previously the exclusive domain of custom ASICs. This family enables leading-edge system architectures in networking applications, storage systems, wireless base stations,
embedded systems, professional broadcast and digital signal processing (DSP) systems.

In
addition, the Virtex-II Pro family is available as Virtex-II Pro™ EasyPath devices, which provide customers up to 80% cost reduction when compared to the
standard FPGA device with no conversion risk. This enables customers to move to lower cost, higher unit volumes without any conversion issues, engineering effort or additional time required to move to
a structured ASIC. Virtex-II Pro EasyPath devices are FPGAs that have been custom tested for a specific customer application and are available for the higher density members of the
Virtex-II Pro family. Customers purchasing these devices must meet certain minimum order requirements.

The
Virtex-II FPGA family is a complete platform for programmable logic that allows digital system designers to rapidly implement a single-chip solution. The
Virtex-II FPGA family currently has eleven devices, all on 300mm wafers. In March 2002,
the Virtex™-II EasyPath solution was introduced. Virtex-II EasyPath devices enable up to an 80% cost reduction compared to the standard FPGA device with no
conversion risk to the customer. As with Virtex-II Pro EasyPath devices, these are available only for the highest density members of the Virtex-II FPGA family and customers
purchasing them must meet certain minimum order requirements.

The
first generation of the Virtex™ architecture includes the Virtex-E FPGA family and Virtex FPGA family. The Virtex-E FPGA family consists of 11 members and is
delivered on 180-nanometer process


technology.
The original Virtex FPGA family, introduced in October 1998, includes nine 2.5-volt Virtex devices that are currently in production on 220-nanometer process
technology with densities ranging from 50,000 to 1 million system gates.

Spartan FPGAs

The Spartan-3 FPGA family was the first PLD family shipping on 90-nanometer process technology. This family consists of eight devices and is one of the
lowest cost FPGAs in the marketplace. These devices are programmable alternatives to ASICs that address customer demand for low cost solutions. The Spartan-3 family addresses a larger
range of cost-sensitive high volume applications than prior Spartan family generations and enables new consumer electronic market opportunities for programmable logic.

The
Spartan-IIE family has seven members shipping and is delivered on 150-nanometer process technology. The Spartan-II family has seven members shipping on
180-nanometer process technology.

The
Spartan™-XL family consists of five members with up to 40,000 system gates on 250-nanometer process technology operating at 3.3 volts. The original
Spartan™ family was introduced in early 2000. It has five members shipping with densities up to 40,000 system gates on 350-nanometer process technology operating at 3.5 volts.

XC4000 FPGAs

The XC4000 family, introduced in 1990, was the first FPGA offering on-board distributed RAM. The XC4000 became an industry standard and was the Company's fastest
growing programmable logic family until the Virtex family was introduced in October 1998. The XC4000 family consists of a number of generations manufactured on 250 to 600-nanometer
process technologies.

CPLDs

The XC9500, XC9500XL and XC9500XV product families offer low cost, high speed and in-system programmability for 5.0-volt, 3.3-volt and
2.5-volt systems, respectively.

In
August 1999, we acquired Philips Semiconductors' line of low power CPLDs called the CoolRunner family. The CoolRunner "XPLA3" line was the first family of CPLD products to combine very low
power with high speed, high density and high I/O counts in a single device. This family has six devices shipping on 350-nanometer process technology. CoolRunner CPLDs also use far less
dynamic power during actual operation compared to conventional CPLDs, an important feature for today's mobile computing applications.

The
CoolRunner-II family is a next-generation family with six devices shipping on 180-nanometer process technology. CoolRunner-II CPLDs contain enhanced
power management and system features at no performance or cost penalty to the customer. We believe that this new class of devices is ideal for both performance-intensive applications as well as power
conscious designs targeting the growing consumer electronics markets.

for information about our revenues from our classes of products.


Research and Development

Our research and development activities are primarily directed towards the design of new ICs, the development of new software design tools for hardware and embedded software,
cores of logic, advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, ongoing cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products. Our primary areas of focus have been to: obtain density and
performance leadership (Virtex-II and Virtex-II Pro FPGA devices); tightly integrate PowerPC microprocessors and multi-gigabit transceivers (Virtex-II Pro and
Virtex-II Pro X); design a low-cost ASIC alternative FPGA solution (Spartan-3 devices); develop CPLD products (CoolRunner-II families); provide a cost
reduction path for FPGA volume production (EasyPath Virtex-II and EasyPath Virtex-II Pro devices); and extend leadership in serial connectivity solutions (RocketPHY and
Virtex-II Pro X). In software and IP cores, we focused on maximum design performance and ease of use by introducing new versions of design tools (Foundation Series ISE software), as well
as embedded software development tools (Embedded Systems Development Kit) cores of logic and a system level design environment for high performance DSP (System Generator for DSP). We collaborated with
our foundry suppliers in the development of 130 and 90-nanometer complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing technology and we believe we are one of the first companies in
the industry to move aggressively to 300mm wafer technology for cost reduction.

Our
research and development challenge is to continue to develop new products that create cost-effective solutions for customers. In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, our research and
development expenses were $247.6 million, $222.1 million and $204.8 million, respectively. These amounts include $3.8 million, $6.4 million and $8.5 million
of non-cash deferred stock compensation associated with the November 2000 acquisition of RocketChips. We expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and
development. We believe technical leadership is essential to our future success and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development effort. However, there can be no
assurance that any of our research and development efforts will be successful, timely or cost-effective.

Acquisition

In March 2004, Xilinx completed the acquisition of Triscend Corporation (Triscend), a privately held fabless semiconductor company with expertise in configurable
embedded microcontroller technology. The total purchase price for Triscend was $30 million in cash plus $1.2 million of acquisition related costs. The acquisition brings to Xilinx both
talent and technology expertise in the microcontroller space. Many of Triscend's 37 employees are or will be deployed to work on future embedded solution projects.

The
Triscend team is comprised of a hardware engineering team, a software development team and individuals focused on sales and administration, such as marketing, finance, operations and IT.
Triscend's family of configurable system-on-chip devices and software solutions will be phased out, freeing most of the team to work on other projects.

Sales and Distribution

We sell our products to OEMs and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to OEMs, or their subcontract manufacturers.

Xilinx
also uses a dedicated global sales and marketing organization as well as independent sales representatives to generate sales. In general, Xilinx focuses its direct demand creation efforts on a
limited number of key accounts while independent sales representatives generally address a defined territory or defined set of customers. Distributors generally provide vendor managed inventory and
logistics for large OEM customers and also create demand within the balance of our customer base.

Regardless
of whether Xilinx, the independent sales representative, or the distributor generate the sale, a local distributor will process and fulfill over 90% of all orders from customers.
Distributors are the legal sellers of the products and as such they bear all risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, such as credit loss, inventory shrinkage and theft as well as
foreign currency fluctuations.

In
accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted the distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also
receive price concessions for unsold product in the case of a subsequent decrease in list prices. Revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to
the end customer.


The
Memec Group (Memec) and Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distribute our products worldwide. No end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues in fiscal year 2004, 2003 or 2002. As of
April 3, 2004, two distributors (Memec and Avnet) accounted for 59% and 22% of total accounts receivable, respectively. As of March 29, 2003, Memec and Avnet accounted for 49% and 34% of
total accounts receivable, respectively. Memec accounted for 47%, 45% and 44% of worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Avnet accounted for 31%, 32% and 30% of worldwide
net revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We also use other regional distributors throughout the world. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors, as we deem appropriate
given the level of business and their performance. We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics
services. Since PLDs are standard products, they do not present many of the inventory risks to distributors posed by custom gate arrays, and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical
support. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for information about concentrations of credit risk. Please also
see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for financial information about our revenues from external customers and
domestic and international operations.

Please
see our consolidated statements of operations, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for financial information about our net income (loss) for fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002. Please see Item 6. "Selected Financial Data" for information about our total assets for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Backlog

As of April 3, 2004, our backlog from OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our distributors scheduled for delivery within the next three months was
$215 million. As of March 29, 2003, our backlog from OEM customers and end customers was $145 million. Orders from end customers to our distributors are subject to changes in
delivery schedules or to cancellation without significant penalty. As a result, end customer backlog to distributors as of any particular period may not be a reliable indicator of revenue for any
future period.

Wafer Fabrication

As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture wafers used for our products. Rather, we purchase wafers from multiple foundry partners including United
Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko). Currently, UMC manufactures the majority of our wafers. Precise terms with
respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations between Xilinx and the wafer foundries.

Our
strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs and software design tools rather than on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry
relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from both our main suppliers as well as other suppliers of leading-edge process technologies. As a result, we have entered into agreements
with UMC, Seiko and IBM as discussed below.

In
September 1995, Xilinx, UMC and other parties entered into a joint venture to construct a wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan, known as United Silicon Inc. (USIC) (see Note 3
to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"). In January 2000, as a result of the merger of USIC into UMC, our equity position in USIC was
converted into shares of UMC, which are publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. We retain monthly guaranteed wafer capacity rights in UMC as long as we retain a certain percentage of our
original UMC shares.

In
fiscal 1997, we signed a wafer purchasing agreement with Seiko that was amended in fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000. Seiko manufactures wafers for our older, more mature product lines.

In
fiscal 2002, we signed a Custom Sales Agreement with IBM, giving us the right to purchase wafers from IBM.


Sort, Assembly and Test

Wafers purchased are sorted by the foundry, independent sort subcontractors, or by Xilinx. Sorted wafers are assembled by subcontractors. During the assembly process, the
wafers are separated into individual die, which are then assembled into various package types. Following assembly, the packaged units are tested by Xilinx personnel at our San Jose, California or
Dublin, Ireland facilities or by independent test subcontractors. We purchase most of our assembly and some of our testing services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. (SPIL) in Taiwan
and from Amkor Technology, Inc. in Korea and the Philippines. Xilinx achieved ISO9001 quality certification in 1995 in San Jose, California and in 2001 in Dublin, Ireland and both locations
achieved TL9000 quality certification in 2003.

Patents and Licenses

While the Company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, Xilinx believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any
particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. Through April 3, 2004, we held 962 issued United States patents, which vary in duration, relating to our products.
We maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of, but not limited to, software, IC architecture, system design, testing methodologies and other technologies relating to
PLDs. Because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire. As a result, we believe that the duration of the
applicable patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. We intend to vigorously protect our intellectual property. We believe that failure to enforce our intellectual property
rights (for example, patents, copyrights and trademarks) or to effectively protect our trade secrets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In the future,
we may incur litigation expenses to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties. Any such litigation may not be successful. Please see Item 3. "Legal Proceedings" and Note 13
to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

We
have acquired various software licenses that permit us to grant object code sublicenses to our customers for certain third party software programs licensed with our software design tools. In
addition, we have licensed certain software for internal use in product design.

Employees

As of April 3, 2004, Xilinx had 2,770 employees compared to 2,612 at the end of the prior year. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not
experienced any work stoppages and believe we maintain good employee relations.

Competition

Our PLDs compete in the logic industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product
obsolescence and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors, Altera Corporation (Altera) and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice), from the ASIC
market, which has been an ongoing competitor since the inception of FPGAs, and from new companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market segment. We believe that important
competitive factors in the logic industry include:

•

product
pricing;

•

time-to-market;

•

product
performance, reliability, power consumption and density;

•

field
upgradability;

•

adaptability
of products to specific applications;

•

ease
of use and functionality of software design tools;

•

functionality
of predefined cores of logic;

•

inventory
management;

•

access
to leading-edge process technology; and,

•

ability
to provide timely customer service and support.

Our
strategy for expansion in the logic market segment includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address high-volume, low-cost applications as well as
high-performance, high-density


applications.
In addition, we anticipate continued price reductions proportionate with our ability to lower the cost for established products. However, we may not be successful in achieving these
strategies.

Other
competitors include manufacturers of:

•

high-density
programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;

•

high-volume
and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for standard cell or custom gate array based ASICs and application specific standard

Several
companies, both large and small, have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to enter the PLD segment. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not
successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The
benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to the logic market segment. We recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are
developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software design
tools that support the full range of Xilinx IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors in the PLD segment.

We
could also face competition from our licensees. Under a license from us, Lucent Technologies (Lucent) had rights to manufacture and market our XC3000 FPGA products and to employ that technology to
provide additional high-density FPGA products. In 2001, Lucent assigned its rights to Agere Systems Inc. (Agere). Agere has subsequently sold a portion of its programmable logic
business to Lattice. Under the terms of the Xilinx license grant, no rights of Agere are transferable to Lattice.

Seiko
has rights to manufacture some of our older products and market them in Japan and Europe, but is not currently doing so. We granted a license to use some of our patents to Advanced Micro Devices
(AMD). AMD produced certain PLDs under that license through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Vantis. In June 1999, AMD sold the Vantis subsidiary to Lattice.

In
conjunction with Xilinx's settlement of the patent litigation with Altera in July 2001, both companies entered into a royalty-free patent cross license agreement for many of each
company's patents.

Corporate Governance

The Board of Directors is the ultimate decision-making body of the Company except with respect to those matters reserved for decision of stockholders. The Board is responsible
for selection of the executive management team, providing oversight responsibility and direction to management, and evaluating the performance of this team on behalf of the stockholders.
Responsibility for day-to-day management of operations is delegated to the executive management team.

The
Board of Directors is composed primarily of independent directors (currently six of eight are independent as defined by the NASDAQ National Marketplace Rules). There is a formal calendar of board
meetings throughout the year. The Board of Directors has appointed three committees to support it in its mandate—the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and
Governance Committee. The Board reviews the responsibilities of these committees periodically.

The
Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities to the stockholders relating to the Company's financial statements and the financial reporting process,
the systems of internal controls, and the audit process. In addition to each of the members of the Audit Committee being independent, the Board of Directors has determined that at least one member of
the Committee—Harold E. Hughes, Jr.—qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules. Stockholders should understand that this designation is a
disclosure requirement of the SEC related to Mr. Hughes's experience and understanding with respect to certain accounting and auditing matters.


The
designation does not impose upon Mr. Hughes, any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than are generally imposed on him as a member of the Audit Committee and the Board, and
his designation as an audit committee financial expert pursuant to this SEC requirement does not affect the duties, obligations or liability of any other member of the Audit Committee or the Board.

The
Compensation Committee has responsibility for establishing the compensation policies of the Company. The Committee determines the compensation of the Company's Board of Directors and its executive
officers and has exclusive authority to grant options to directors and executive officers under the 1997 Stock Plan.

The
Nominating and Governance Committee has responsibility for nominating individuals to serve as members of the Board of Directors, and to establish policies affecting corporate governance. The
Nominating and Governance Committee, among other things, determines the size and composition of the Company's Board of Directors and nominates directors and executive officers for election.

As
a leader in our business segment and underlining our commitment to quality, we believe in strong corporate governance principles and practices. Our corporate governance principles are reviewed by
the Board, executive management and General Counsel and are periodically revised in response to changing legal and regulatory requirements and evolving best practices. The Company has taken a number
of steps in recent years designed to improve its corporate governance process. Among the steps taken, the Company:

•

determined
that a substantial majority of the Board of Directors will be independent directors. Currently six of eight directors are independent;

•

has
adopted and implemented a self-evaluation process for the Board of Directors;

•

requires
compliance with the NASDAQ National Marketplace issuer requirements for independent directors;

•

requires
that directors or employees asked to serve on the Board of Directors of other companies seek a determination from the CEO and the General Counsel of Xilinx as to
whether such board participation would be problematic to Xilinx;

•

determined
that all directors are to be elected annually at the annual stockholder meeting;

•

adopted
a retirement policy for directors under which directors may not stand for re-election after age 75;

•

appointed
a lead independent director to serve when the Chairman of the Board is also the Chief Executive Officer;

•

restricts
participation on the Audit Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and Compensation Committee to independent directors;

•

requires
that independent directors are given an opportunity to meet on a regular basis outside the presence of other Board members and management representatives, and the
lead independent director is responsible for setting the agenda and running the meetings;

•

requires
that the Board of Directors and its committees have authority to engage independent advisors and consultants;

•

updated
its Codes of Conduct applicable to employees and directors and its significant corporate governance principles and published these on the Company's website;

•

introduced
a code of ethics for senior financial officers and the finance function;

•

issued
procedures and guidelines governing securities trades by employees, including limitations on the ability of senior officers to trade other than in the period
following the announcement of the Company's quarterly earnings;

•

closely
monitors the auditing and services provided by the outside auditor and requires pre-approval of all non-audit services to ensure auditor
independence; and,

•

introduced
a formal "whistle blowing" process for employees that includes anonymous reporting, if desired.

Xilinx's
success is founded on its reputation of integrity and ethical business practices and has built this reputation over time through the efforts of its employees. The Company has adopted eight
Corporate Values (Customer Focus, Respect, Excellence, Accountability, Teamwork, Integrity, Very Open Communications and Enjoying Our Work) to provide a framework for all employees in pursuit of high
standards of integrity and ethical behavior.


The
Xilinx Code of Conduct and Business Ethics contains the Company's core expectations of the manner in which employees will conduct business on behalf of Xilinx. All of our employees are required to
abide by our long-standing standards of Business Ethics and Conduct to ensure that Xilinx operates in a consistent legal and ethical manner. The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of
Ethics pertaining to the Board, which covers topics including insider trading, conflicts of interest, financial reporting and compliance with other laws.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate offices, which include the administrative, sales, customer support, marketing, research and development and final testing groups are located in San Jose,
California. The site consists of adjacent buildings providing 588,000 square feet of space, which we own. We purchased 87 acres of land in South San Jose near our corporate facility in
February 2000. Plans for infrastructure and the future development of this land have not been finalized. In July 2000, due to the anticipated rapid growth of the Company, we purchased
two adjacent buildings near downtown San Jose providing 200,000 square feet of office space. These buildings were renovated, but the Company never took occupancy. During fiscal 2004 and 2003, the
Company recognized impairment losses on excess facilities related to the vacant property in San Jose. In March 2004, the Company sold this facility. See Note 6 to our consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

In
addition, we own a 228,000 square foot administrative, research and development and final testing facility in the metropolitan area of Dublin, Ireland. The Irish facility is primarily used to
service our customer base outside of North America.

We
also own a 130,000 square foot facility in Longmont, Colorado. The Longmont facility serves as the primary location for our software efforts in the areas of research and development, manufacturing
and quality control. In July 2000, the Company also purchased a 200,000 square foot facility and 40 acres of land adjacent to the Longmont facility for future expansion. The facility is being
partially leased to tenants under short-term lease agreements and partially used by the Company.

We
own a 45,000 square foot facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico used for the development of our CoolRunner CPLD product families as well as IP cores. We lease office facilities for our engineering
design centers in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Austin, Texas and our subsidiary, Triscend Corporation in Mountain View, California.

We
also lease North American sales offices in various locations which include the metropolitan areas of Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Nashua, Ottawa, Raleigh, San Diego, San Jose and Toronto
as well as international sales offices located in the metropolitan areas of Brussels, Hong Kong, London, Milan, Munich, Osaka, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Stockholm, Taipei, Tel Aviv and Tokyo.

In
April 2004, we entered into a sublease on a 15,000 square foot facility in Singapore. The Singapore facility will serve as our regional headquarters in Asia and will support our customers in
Asia Pacific and Japan.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Company for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. To date, several issues have been settled with
the Appeals Office of the IRS. As of April 3, 2004, unresolved issues asserted by the IRS total $19.0 million in additional taxes due, including penalties and a reduction of future net
operating losses of $31.2 million.


We
filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court on March 26, 2001, in response to assertions by the IRS that the Company owed additional tax for fiscal years 1996 through 1998. Several issues,
including the arm's length royalty issue discussed below, have been settled with the Appeals Office of the IRS.

In
October 2002, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency for fiscal year 1999. The notice of deficiency was based on issues that were also asserted in the previous notice of deficiency for fiscal
years 1996 through 1998. On January 14, 2003, the Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court in response to the October 2002 notice of deficiency.

In
October 2003, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency for fiscal year 2000. The notice of deficiency was based on issues that were also asserted in the previous notices of deficiency for
fiscal years 1996 through 1999. In addition, the IRS disallowed a carryback of general business credits from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 1995. The Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court
on January 16, 2004, in response to the October 2003 notice of deficiency.

On
April 6, 2004, we filed a settlement stipulation concerning the arm's length royalty for the license between the Company and Xilinx Ireland for fiscal years 1996 through 1999. On
April 29, 2004, we filed a settlement stipulation concerning the arm's length royalty for the license between the Company and Xilinx Ireland for fiscal year 2000. The IRS agreed not to increase
Xilinx's taxable income for this issue. The IRS had asserted increased taxable income of $242 million for fiscal years 1996 through 1999 and $57 million for fiscal year 2000.

One
of the unresolved issues relates to whether the value of compensatory stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Company and the IRS filed cross motions
for summary judgment in 2002 relating to this stock option cost sharing issue. In March 2003, the IRS changed its position concerning the treatment of stock options in cost sharing agreements.
The IRS now excludes stock options granted prior to the beginning of the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The IRS change in position reduced the amount originally at issue on the treatment
of stock options in cost sharing agreements, which was the subject of the summary judgment motions. On October 28, 2003, the Tax Court issued an order denying both Xilinx's and the IRS's cross
motions for summary judgment on the stock option cost sharing issue. The order stated that evidence is necessary to establish whether the stock options are a cost related to research and development
and to determine whether unrelated parties would share the cost of stock options in a cost sharing agreement. The Court has granted an IRS motion to amend its answer to assert an alternative
deficiency based on the Black-Scholes value of stock options on grant. The trial for this issue has been set for July 14, 2004, and fiscal year 1999 has been combined with the fiscal years 1997
to 1998.

We
are in discussions with the Appeals Office to resolve and settle the remaining issues, other than the stock option cost sharing issue discussed above. It is premature to comment further on the
likely outcome of any issues that have not been settled to date. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the remaining adjustments and sufficient taxes have been provided.

Other
than as stated above, we know of no legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or agency against the Company.

In
March 2002, Aldec, Inc (Aldec) filed a complaint in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, alleging copyright infringement and breach of contract by the Company
arising from the expiration of a license agreement for certain Aldec software. Aldec sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) simultaneous with the filing of its complaint. The Court denied the
request for a TRO.

On
September 2, 2003, the Company settled all outstanding litigation with Aldec, for an amount that was immaterial to the Company's results of operations or its financial condition.

In
fiscal year 2004, the Company allowed sales representative agreements with three related European entities, Rep'tronic S.A., Rep'tronic España, and Acsis S.r.l., a Rep'tronic Company
(collectively Rep'tronic) to expire pursuant to their terms. In May 2003, Rep'tronic filed lawsuits in the High Court of Ireland against the Company claiming compensation arising from
termination of an alleged commercial agency between Rep'tronic and the Company. On March 31, 2004, Rep'tronic amended each of its statements of claim to include an additional claim related to
the termination of the alleged commercial agency. The Company has not yet been required to file its defense and no significant discovery has occurred.


On
January 21, 2004, Rep'tronic S.A. joined Xilinx SARL into a lawsuit before the Labor Court of Versailles brought by five former Rep'tronic S.A. employees against Rep'tronic S.A. for unfair
dismissal. Rep'tronic S.A. is seeking indemnification from Xilinx SARL on the theory that the employees of Rep'tronic S.A. became the employees of Xilinx SARL or Xilinx Ireland upon the expiration of
the sales representative agreement. Xilinx SARL will file its evidence on July 14, 2004. A hearing has been set for September 20, 2004.

On
February 10, 2004, Rep'tronic S.A. filed a lawsuit against Xilinx SARL in the Commercial Court of Versailles. The lawsuit is pled as an unfair competition matter but the claims and the facts
upon which they are based are essentially the same as the commercial agency claims being addressed before the High Court of Ireland. Xilinx SARL has filed its defense. No hearing has been set.

The
Company has accrued amounts that represent anticipated payments for liability for the Rep'tronic litigation under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (SFAS 5), "Accounting for Contingencies."

Except
as stated above, there are no pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Cautionary Statement

The statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis that are forward looking involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader
should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under "Factors Affecting Future Results" and elsewhere in this document. Forward looking statements
can often be identified by the use of forward looking words, such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "continue," "plan," "intend," "project," or other
similar words.

Nature of Operations

Xilinx designs, develops and markets complete programmable logic solutions, including advanced ICs, software design tools, predefined system functions delivered as IP cores,
design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs and CPLDs. These devices are standard products that our customers program to perform desired logic
functions. Our products are designed to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers primarily in the communications, storage,
server, consumer, industrial and other markets. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors, through direct sales to OEMs by a network of independent
sales representative firms and through a direct sales management organization.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and
require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical
policies include: valuation of financial instruments, which impacts gains (losses) on equity securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of revenues;
valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin; the assessment of impairment of long-lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets, which impacts
their valuation, and accounting for income taxes, which impacts the provision (benefit) recognized for income taxes, as well as the classification and valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities
recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as
subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult.

Valuation of Financial Instruments

The Company's short-term and long-term investments include marketable and non-marketable equity and debt securities. At April 3,
2004, the Company had an equity investment in UMC, a public Taiwanese semiconductor wafer manufacturing company, of $324.0 million and strategic investments in non-marketable equity
securities of $22.9 million. In determining if and when a decline in market value below cost of these investments is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates the
market conditions, offering prices, trends of earnings, price multiples, and other key measures for our investments. When a decline in value is deemed to be
other-than-temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline.


Revenue Recognition

Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to
distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to customers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the end
customer. Reported information includes product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment information, as well as inventory on hand. Distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to deferred
revenue balances monthly. Xilinx maintains system controls to validate the data and verify that the reported information is accurate. The effects of distributor price adjustments are recorded as a
reduction to deferred income on shipments to distributors reflecting the amount of gross margin expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from Xilinx. Accounts
receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to
collection under normal payment terms.

Revenue
from sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of
resulting receivables is reasonably assured, there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there were no formal
acceptance provisions with our direct customers.

Revenue
from software term licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is provided. Revenue
from support products, which includes software and services sales, was less than 10% of net revenues for all of the periods presented.

Allowances
for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending customer returns or allowances.

Valuation of Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or market (estimated net realizable value). The Company
reviews and sets standard costs quarterly at current manufacturing costs. The Company's manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted
spending over projected volumes. Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product life cycles, the Company writes down inventory based on backlog, forecasted demand and
technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that
may include uncertain elements. In addition, backlog is subject to revisions, cancellations and rescheduling. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material
effect on the Company's gross margins.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Intangibles

We adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142) effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Accordingly, for fiscal
2003 and future years, we no longer amortized goodwill from acquisitions, but we continued to amortize other acquisition-related intangibles. We expect amortization of other intangibles to be
approximately $5.0 million for fiscal 2005 compared with $9.8 million for fiscal 2004 and down from $15.3 million of amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related
intangibles in fiscal 2003.

At
April 3, 2004, the net book value of acquisition related intangibles totaled $128.4 million, comprised of unamortized goodwill of $111.6 million and other acquisition related
intangibles of $16.8 million. We completed the annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and found no impairment. Unless there are indicators of impairment,
our next impairment review will be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. To date, no impairment indicators have been identified.

We
are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level for which purpose we have previously determined that we operate in one reportable segment containing one reporting unit. If
we fail


to
deliver new products, if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance, or if market conditions fail to continue to improve, our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and we may
incur charges for impairment of goodwill. We also consider whether long-lived assets are impaired. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future
undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their
estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the
excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the overall profitability of the Company's business and our ability to
generate positive cash flows. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Xilinx is a multinational corporation operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. Xilinx must determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates
and assumptions, and apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. Xilinx undergoes routine audits by taxing authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of
income among various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between
jurisdictions with different tax rates.

In
determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the
determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Additionally, we
must estimate the amount and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or deficiency notices issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities' positions and our assessment can change over
time resulting in material impacts on the provision for income taxes in periods where these changes occur.

We
must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve, in the form of a
valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. As of April 3, 2004, we believe that all of our recorded deferred tax assets will
ultimately be recovered. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is "more
likely than not," under the provisions of SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," that the tax benefit associated with the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We
classify our product offerings into four categories: New, Mainstream, Base and Support Products. These product categories, excluding Support Products, are adjusted on a periodic basis to better
reflect advances in technology. The most recent adjustment was on March 30, 2003, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2004. Amounts for the prior periods presented have been reclassified to
conform to this latest categorization. New Products include our most recent product offerings and include the Spartan-IIE, Spartan-3, Virtex-II,
Virtex-II Pro, Virtex-II EasyPath and CoolRunner-II product lines. Mainstream Products include the XC4000XL, XC4000XLA, XC4000XV, Spartan-II, SpartanXL,
XC9500XL, XC9500XV, CoolRunner, Virtex-E and Virtex product lines. Base Products consist of our mature product families and include the XC3000, XC3100, XC4000, XC5200, XC9500, XC4000E,
XC4000EX and Spartan families. Support Products make up the remainder of our product offerings and include configuration solutions (serial PROMs), software, IP cores, customer training, design
services and support.

Xilinx's
net revenues increased 21% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to strong customer demand for our New Products and continued growth in our Consumer,
Industrial and Other end market segment. Xilinx's net revenues increased 14% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily due to the growth in the Storage and Consumer,
Industrial and Other market segments.

The
increase in revenues of New Products for both fiscal 2004 and 2003 compared to their respective prior fiscal years was due to the strong market acceptance of these products across
a broad base of end markets including storage, communications and consumer-based applications.

The
improved market conditions in the second half of fiscal 2004 were not enough to offset weakness in the first half of 2004 thus leading to relatively flat performance for Mainstream Products
compared to fiscal 2003. After an economic downturn in fiscal 2002, a gradual improvement led to small growth in fiscal 2003 for Mainstream Products.

The
small revenue growth in Base Products from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was due to improved market conditions. Revenue decline in Base Products in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was mainly due
to the weak overall economic environment. Lastly, both configuration solutions (serial PROMs) and software contributed to the strong fiscal 2004 for Support Products compared to 2003.

In
order to compete effectively, we pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is common
in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost. We have historically been able to offset much of
the revenue decline in our mature products with increased revenues from newer products.

The
improvement of North America revenue in fiscal 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to the growth in the Communications and Storage and Servers markets, which benefited from an
improved economy and healthier end market demand.

International
revenues grew 35% and 21% in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, and represented approximately 58%, 52% and 48% of total net revenues for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Europe grew in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to strength in industrial, automotive and wireless communication applications. Japan and Asia Pacific/Rest of World (APAC/ROW) grew in
fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 mainly due to consumer-based applications. APAC/ROW also benefited from the transfer of manufacturing by North American and European OEMs to Asia Pacific.

North
America, Europe, Japan, and APAC/ROW all experienced revenue increases in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 due to the strength in the storage and consumer sectors. APAC/ROW revenue
increase also benefited from the transfer of manufacturing by North American OEMs to Asia.


Net Revenues by End Markets

Our end market revenue data is derived from our understanding of our end customers' primary markets. We classify our revenue by end market in three categories: Communications;
Storage and Servers; and Consumer, Industrial and Other. Net revenues by end markets for the three years ended April 3, 2004 were as follows:

In
the latter part of fiscal 2004, the Communications market began to recover driven by wireless and networking applications. The decline in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002
reflects overall economic decline. Storage and Servers revenues increased in fiscal 2004 and 2003 compared to their respective prior fiscal years largely due to several customer designs entering
production. Storage and Servers business as a percentage of total revenues is expected to decline going forward as the other end markets gain strength and several large customer programs migrate to
newer products. The strong growth in the Consumer, Industrial and Other in fiscal 2004 and 2003 compared to their respective prior fiscal years was due to increasing acceptance of programmable logic
solutions in digital consumer, defense, instrumentation and automotive applications.

The
gross margin improvements in fiscal 2004 compared to 2003, and 2003 compared to 2002 was largely due to higher revenue, improved yields and lower manufacturing costs due to the
migration to 300-milimeter wafer production.

Gross
margin may be adversely affected in the future due to product mix shifts, competitive pricing pressure, manufacturing yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate this risk by migrating
wafer technology from 200-milimeter to 300-milimeter, developing 90-nanometer process technology and improving yields.

Sales
of inventory previously written off were not material during fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.

$8.5 million, respectively, associated with the November 2000 acquisition of RocketChips. The increase in R&D expenses from fiscal 2003 to 2004 was primarily related to process
technology and development of next generation products. The increase in R&D expenses from fiscal 2002 to 2003 was primarily related to process development of new products, an increase in employee
compensation expenses from reinstatement of full pay for fiscal 2003 and profit sharing expenses.

We
will continue to invest in R&D efforts in a wide variety of areas such as 90-nanometer and more advanced process technologies, IP cores and the development of new design and layout
software.

The
increase in SG&A expenses from fiscal 2003 to 2004 was primarily related to increased commissions associated with higher revenues, expenses related to increased sales resources in
key markets and increased marketing activities. The increase in SG&A expenses from fiscal 2002 to 2003 was primarily related to higher sales commissions, higher employee compensation expenses due to
the reinstatement of full pay for fiscal 2003 and profit sharing expenses, partially offset by a reduction in legal expenses due to the settlement of the Altera litigation in July 2001 (see
"Altera Corporation Lawsuit Settlement" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations).

Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Amortization expense for all intangible assets for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $9.8 million, $15.3 million and $49.0 million, respectively. Of these
amounts, $9.6 million, $14.6 million and $43.0 million for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to the RocketChips acquisition and the remaining amounts related to
other technology acquisitions. Amortization expense for these intangible assets has declined due to the complete amortization of certain intangibles associated with the RocketChips' acquisition and
the cessation of goodwill amortization after fiscal 2002.

Goodwill
and acquired intangibles were amortized through fiscal year 2002 using an estimated useful life of four to seven years. Under the provisions of SFAS 142, as of the beginning of fiscal
2003, we no longer amortized goodwill which instead is subject to periodic impairment tests, but we continued to amortize other intangible assets.

Impairment Losses

The impairment loss on excess facilities and equipment recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 of $54.7 million related primarily to excess facilities owned
in San Jose, California. The Company lost a potential long-term arrangement to lease the facilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2003, leaving the Company with no
near-term leasing alternatives or prospects for sale. The amount of the impairment was based on management's evaluation of future cash flows and an independent appraisal obtained during
the third quarter of fiscal 2003.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company received a purchase offer from a prospective buyer for an amount less than the facilities' net book value of $35.4 million. In accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 144, an additional impairment charge of $3.4 million was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company
sold the facilities for $33.8 million ($32.0 million, net of selling costs), resulting in no additional loss or gain.

The
impairment loss on investments of $10.4 million and $4.3 million recognized during fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to non-marketable equity securities
in private companies. Of the $4.3 million of impairment losses on investments in fiscal 2002, $2.8 million is separately disclosed and $1.5 million was included in research and
development expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

We
recognized an impairment loss on intangible assets and equipment of $25.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 consisting of $14.9 million relating to goodwill and other
intangible assets associated with a number of technology acquisitions completed during fiscal 2001 and 2000 and $10.4 million for the write-down of excess testers that were acquired
in anticipation of higher unit growth.

Write-Off of Acquired In-Process Research and Development

In connection with the acquisition of Triscend in fiscal 2004, approximately $7.0 million of in-process research and development costs were written off. The
projects identified as in-process would have required additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility. These projects had identifiable technological


risk
factors that indicated that even though successful completion was expected, it was not assured. If an identified project is not successfully completed, there is no alternative future use for the
project and the expected future income will not be realized. The acquired in-process research and development represented the fair value of technologies in the development stage that had
not yet reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses.

The
acquired in-process research and development components consist of a graphical user interface and design implementation software. We do not plan to sell or provide these products to
Xilinx or Triscend customers, however they will be integrated into Xilinx's product set. These products were approximately 60% complete at the time of acquisition. We expect to complete the
development project by the end of fiscal 2005 with an estimated cost to complete of $2 million.

To
determine the value of the in-process research and development, the expected future cash flow attributable to the in-process technology was discounted, taking into account
the percentage of completion, utilization of pre-existing "core" technology, risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology, existing and future markets, and
technological risk associated with completing the development of the technology. We expensed these non-recurring charges in the period of acquisition. See Note 14 to our
consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Investment in United Microelectronics Corporation

In September 1995, Xilinx, UMC and other parties entered into a joint venture to construct a wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan, known as USIC. The Company made a
total cumulative cash investment of $107.1 million in USIC. The investment entitled Xilinx to receive up to 31.25% of USIC's wafer capacity.

In
January 2000, USIC merged into UMC and Xilinx's equity position in USIC converted into shares of UMC, which are publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. As a result of this merger, we
received approximately 222 million shares of UMC common stock, which represent approximately 2% of the combined UMC Group, and we recognized a non-cash gain of $674.7 million
($398.1 million net of taxes) in fiscal 2000. Since the merger, Xilinx has received a total of approximately 145 million UMC shares in four separate annual stock dividend distributions
increasing our investment holdings to approximately 367 million shares. We retain wafer capacity rights in UMC equivalent to those we previously had in USIC, so long as we retain a certain
percentage of our original UMC shares. If our holdings fall below the specified level, our wafer capacity rights would be prorated in accordance with the UMC shares we hold.

Restrictions
on the sale of these shares, imposed by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange, began to expire in July 2000 and fully expired in January 2004. As of April 3, 2004, the
entire UMC investment was unrestricted.

We
account for our investment in UMC as available-for-sale marketable securities in accordance with SFAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Debt and Equity Securities." At
March 29, 2003, the restricted portion of the investment in UMC was accounted for as a cost method investment.

The
fair value of our UMC shares declined to $239.0 million as of September 29, 2001. Because of the continued downturn in the global economy, in general, and in the technology sector in
particular, we believed that the decline in the market value of our investment in UMC as of September 29, 2001 was other than temporary. Accordingly, during this second quarter of fiscal 2002,
we recognized a pre-tax impairment loss on our investment in UMC of $191.9 million ($113.2 million, net of tax) to reflect this other-than-temporary
decline in market value. The fair value of our unrestricted UMC shares subsequently increased by $141.4 million during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002, increasing the total value
of our UMC investment to $380.4 million at March 30, 2002. Under the provisions of SFAS 115, we increased the value of the UMC investment by $141.4 million, recognized
deferred tax liabilities of $58.0 million and increased accumulated other comprehensive income by $83.4 million.

At
March 29, 2003, our equity investment in UMC shares was valued at $209.3 million on the Company's consolidated balance sheet reflecting a $171.1 million decrease in value
during fiscal 2003. Under SFAS 115, we decreased the value of our UMC investment by $171.1 million, recognized a deferred tax benefit of $70.2 million and decreased accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) by $100.9 million. As of March 29, 2003, the market value of our total UMC investment was $29.7 million below its adjusted


cost
of $239.0 million. We deemed the decline in value of our total investment in UMC to be temporary in nature.

Altera Corporation Lawsuit Settlement

On July 18, 2001, the Company settled all of its outstanding patent litigation with Altera, under which Altera paid Xilinx $20 million and both parties exchanged
limited patent licenses and executed agreements not to sue under any patent for at least five years. During fiscal 2002 we recorded the lawsuit settlement received of $19.4 million, net of
settlement costs of approximately $600 thousand.

The
decrease from fiscal 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to miscellaneous items of other income, net. Additionally, lower interest rates in fiscal 2004 largely offset the benefit of
higher average cash and investment balances compared to the prior year. The decrease from fiscal 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to a reduction in capital gains recognized and lower interest rates in
fiscal 2003 compared to the prior year. The amount of interest income and other, net in the future will continue to be impacted by the level of our average cash and investment balances, prevailing
interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.

The
effective tax rates in all years reflect the impact of foreign income/loss at different rates and tax credits earned in the United States. The fiscal year 2004 effective tax rate
reflects the one-time benefit for reversing previously accrued reserves for an IRS audit that disputed the calculation of royalty payments that the Company's Ireland subsidiary paid to
license the Company's technology. The IRS agreed to a stipulation in April 2004 concurring with the Company's original royalty calculations. The increase in the Company's fiscal year 2002
effective tax rate resulted from one-time write-offs of impaired assets that were not deductible for tax purposes, and the amortization of nondeductible goodwill.

The
Company filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court on March 26, 2001 and January 14, 2003 in response to assertions by the IRS that the Company owed additional tax for fiscal years 1996
through 1999. The Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court on January 16, 2004, in response to assertions by the IRS that the Company owed additional tax for fiscal year 2000. See
Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."


Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing to support ongoing business activities, acquire critical technologies and
make investments in complementary technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our Common Stock under our stock repurchase program and finance working capital. Additionally, our
investment in UMC is available for future sale.

Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and Long-term Investments

The combination of cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments at April 3, 2004 totaled $1.6 billion compared with
$1.1 billion at March 29, 2003.

We
generated positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2004. As of April 3, 2004, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $799 million and working
capital of $920.4 million. Cash provided by operations of $432.5 million for fiscal 2004 was $87.5 million higher than the $345.0 million generated during fiscal 2003.
Increases in cash generated by operations resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash related items, and increases in accounts payable and deferred income on shipments to
distributors, which were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable.

Net
cash used in investing activities of $354.8 million during fiscal 2004 included net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $325.8 million,
$41.0 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment and $20.0 million for the acquisition of Triscend, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $32.0 million of proceeds
from the sale of buildings and land.

cash provided by financing activities was $45.6 million in fiscal 2004 and consisted of $108.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans,
partially offset by $62.3 million for the acquisition of treasury stock.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments increased 25.9% from $197.7 million at the end of
fiscal 2003 to $249.0 million at the end of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased level of revenue and an increase in shipments late in the year.

Inventories

Inventories decreased from $111.5 million at March 29, 2003 to $102.5 million at April 3, 2004 due to an increased demand for new products, and our
continued focus on supply chain management.

We
attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product, package and speed configurations in order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand. Conversely, we also
attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing
process advancements. We continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost.

Property, Plant and Equipment

During 2004, we invested $41.0 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $46.0 million in 2003. Primary investments in fiscal 2004 were for test
equipment, computer equipment, IT equipment and software. Software investments included additional enterprise resource planning software functionality and automation of critical business processes.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we sold excess facilities consisting of two buildings and land near downtown San Jose, California for $33.8 million ($32.0 million, net of
selling costs). After recognizing previous impairment losses on these excess facilities of $53.8 million in fiscal 2003 and $3.4 million in fiscal 2004, there was no gain or loss on the
sale of the buildings and land.


Current Liabilities

Current liabilities increased from $313.8 million at the end of fiscal 2003 to $381.1 million at the end of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily attributable
to the increase in accounts payable and deferred income on shipments to distributors. The increase in accounts payable was a result of increased purchases and the increase in deferred income on
shipments to distributors was due to increased inventory levels at distributors, related to higher revenue levels in 2004 compared to 2003 and an increase in shipments to distributors later in the
year.

Stockholders' Equity

Stockholders' equity increased $532.3 million during fiscal 2004, principally as a result of $303.0 million in net income for the year ended April 3, 2004,
the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $109.2 million, $3.8 million in amortization of deferred compensation related to the RocketChips acquisition, the related tax
benefits associated with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan and cumulative translation adjustment totaling $110.7 million and by $68.4 million in unrealized
gains on available-for-sale securities, net of deferred taxes, primarily from our investment in UMC stock. The increases were partially offset by the acquisition of treasury
stock of $62.8 million.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and Long-term Investments

The combination of cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments at March 29, 2003 totaled $1.1 billion compared with
$799 million at March 30, 2002.

We
generated positive cash flows from operations during fiscal 2003. As of March 29, 2003, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $675.6 million and
working capital of $861.4 million. Cash provided by operations of $345.0 million for fiscal 2003 was $64.1 million higher than the $280.9 million generated during fiscal
2002. Increases in cash generated by operations resulted primarily from net income adjusted for receipt of federal income tax refunds of approximately $74.1 million and an increase in deferred
income on shipments to distributors, which were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable.

During
fiscal 2003, net cash used in investing activities of $355.1 million included net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $315.6 million and
$46.0 million of property, plant and equipment purchases partially offset by $6.5 million of proceeds from the sale of a building.

For
fiscal 2003, net cash used in financing activities of $6.2 million included $60.8 million for the acquisition of treasury stock, partially offset by $54.6 million of proceeds
from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments increased 33.2% from $148.4 million at the end of
fiscal 2002 to $197.7 million at the end of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased level of revenue and an increase in shipments late in the year, which were
reflected in the higher levels of inventory at our distributors.

Inventories

Inventories increased from $79.3 million at March 30, 2002 to $111.5 million at March 29, 2003 due to an increased demand for new products, which
led to higher levels of inventory production.

Property, Plant and Equipment

During 2003, we invested $46.0 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $94.9 million in 2002. Primary investments in fiscal 2003 were for building
expansion, enterprise resources planning software and computer and IT equipment.


Current Liabilities

Current liabilities increased from $195.8 million at the end of fiscal 2002 to $313.8 million at the end of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily attributable
to the increase in income taxes payable and deferred income on shipments to distributors. The increase in income taxes payable was a result of higher taxable income and the increase in deferred income
on shipments to distributors was due to increased inventory levels at distributors, related to higher revenue levels in 2003 compared to 2002.

Stockholders' Equity

Stockholders' equity increased $47.0 million during fiscal 2003, principally as a result of $125.7 million in net income for the year ended March 31, 2003,
the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $54.6 million, $6.4 million in amortization of deferred compensation related to the RocketChips acquisition, and the related
tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan and cumulative translation adjustment totaling $18.3 million. The increases were partially offset by
$97.6 million in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, net of deferred taxes, primarily from our investment in UMC stock and the acquisition of treasury
stock of $60.4 million.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at April 3, 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash
flows in future periods. This table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at April 3, 2004.

(2)

Due
to the nature of our business, we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The lengthy subcontractor lead
times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to pay for the materials and services when completed. We expect to receive and pay for the materials and services
in the next three to six months.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

As of April 3, 2004, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC
Regulation S-K.

Summary of Liquidity and Capital Resources

On April 22, 2004, the Board of Directors declared our first quarterly common stock dividend, of $0.05 per share, which is payable on June 2, 2004 to stockholders
of record at the close of business on May 12, 2004. Our dividend policy is impacted by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and
development, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs and other strategic investments.

We
anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, the risk factors discussed below could
affect our cash positions adversely. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities,
development of new products, and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could complement our business. We may use available cash or other sources of funding for such purposes.


Factors Affecting Future Results

The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company's management currently deems immaterial also may
impair its business operations. If any of the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be materially adversely affected.

The
semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and cyclical market patterns which contribute to create factors that may affect our future operating
results including:

Market Demand

•

limited
visibility of demand for products, especially new products;

•

fluctuations
in demand for our products and services;

•

increased
dependence on turns orders (orders received and shipped within the same fiscal quarter);

•

reduced
capital spending by our customers;

•

weaker
demand for our products or those of our customers due to a prolonged period of economic uncertainty;

•

excess
inventory within the supply chain including overbuilding of OEM products;

•

additional
excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding write-downs due to a significant deterioration in demand;

•

inability
to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product in a timely manner;

•

inability
to obtain manufacturing capacity in sufficient volume;

•

inability
to predict the success of our customers' products in their markets;

•

an
unexpected increase in demand resulting in longer lead times that causes delays in customer production schedules;

•

dependence
on the health of the end markets and customers we serve;

Competitive Environment

•

price
and product competition in the semiconductor industry, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation;

•

major
customers converting to ASIC designs from Xilinx's PLDs;

•

erosion
of average selling prices;

•

timely
introduction of new products;

Technology

•

lower
gross margins due to product mix shifts and reduced manufacturing efficiency improvements;

•

failure
to retain or attract specialized technical/management personnel;

•

timely
implementation of new manufacturing technologies;

•

ability
to safeguard the Company's products from competitors by means of patents and other intellectual property protections;

•

impact
of new technologies which result in rapid escalation of demand for some products in the face of equally steep declines in demand for others;

Other

•

changes
in accounting rules;

•

dependence
on distributors to generate sales and process customer orders;

•

impact
of changes to current export/import laws and regulations;

•

volatility
of the securities market, particularly as it relates to the high technology sector and our investment in UMC;

•

global
events impacting the world economy or specific regions of the world; and,

•

catastrophes
that impact the ability of our supply chain partners to operate or deliver product.


We
attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. For example, the
overbuilding in the telecommunications industry resulted in a reduction in capital spending causing a slowdown in orders for our products. Due to these and other factors, our past results, including
those described in this report, are much less reliable predictors of the future than with companies in many older, more stable and mature industries. Based on the factors noted herein, we may
experience substantial fluctuations in future operating results.

Our
results of operations are impacted by global economic and political conditions, dependence on new products, dependence on independent manufacturers and subcontractors, competition, intellectual
property, and litigation, each of which is discussed in greater detail below.

Potential Effect of Global Economic and Political Conditions

Sales and operations outside of the United States subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments. Our financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates
affecting those countries. For example, we have sales and operations in Asia Pacific and Japan. Past economic weakness in these markets adversely affected revenues, and such conditions may occur in
the future. Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. While the recent movement of the Euro and Yen against the U.S. dollar had no material impact to our
business, increased volatility could impact our European and Japanese customers. Currency instability may increase credit risks for some of our customers and may impair our customers' ability to repay
existing obligations. Increased currency volatility could also positively or negatively impact our foreign currency denominated costs. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations in the future.

Our
financial condition and results of operations are becoming increasingly dependent on the global economy. Any instability in worldwide economic environments, such as experienced after the terrorist
attacks on September 11, 2001, could lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers. Additional risks to us include U.S. military actions, economic sanctions imposed by the U.S.
government, government regulation of exports, imposition of tariffs and other potential trade barriers, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and generally longer
receivable collection periods. Moreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political conflicts in Taiwan where our main wafer provider, UMC, as well
as a significant number of suppliers to the semiconductor industry, end customers and contract manufacturers who provide manufacturing services worldwide, are located.

Dependence on New Products

Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price,
density, functionality and performance. The success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors, including:

•

timely
completion of new product designs;

•

ability
to generate new design wins;

•

ability
to engage in key relationships with companies that provide synergistic products and services;

•

ability
to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies including a transition to 300 millimeter wafers as well as to circuit geometries on 90 nanometers and
smaller;

•

achieving
acceptable yields;

•

ability
to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly subcontractors;

•

ability
to obtain advanced packaging;

•

availability
of supporting software design tools;

•

utilization
of predefined cores of logic;

•

industry
acceptance; and,

•

successful
deployment of systems by our customers.


We
cannot assure you that our product development efforts will be successful, that our new products will achieve industry acceptance or that we will achieve the necessary volume of production that
would lead to further per unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future. As a result, we will be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from
design wins for our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost
reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while
maintaining consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our products do not achieve market
acceptance at prices with higher margins, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Dependence on Independent Manufacturers and Subcontractors

We do not manufacture our own silicon wafers. During fiscal year 2004, all of our wafers were manufactured in Taiwan by UMC, in Japan by Seiko and in the United States by IBM.
Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations between Xilinx and these wafer
foundries, which usually result in short-term agreements. We are dependent on these foundries, especially UMC, which supplies over 70% of our wafers. We rely on UMC to produce wafers with
competitive performance and cost attributes, which include transitioning to advanced manufacturing process technologies, producing wafers at acceptable yields, and delivering them in a timely manner.
We cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies. In
addition, greater demand for wafers produced by the foundries raises the likelihood of potential wafer price increases.

UMC's
foundries in Taiwan and Seiko's foundries in Japan as well as many of our operations in California are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the recent past. Should there be a
major earthquake in our suppliers' or our operating locations in the future, our operations, including our manufacturing activities, may be disrupted. This type of disruption could result in our
inability to ship products in a timely manner, thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, disruption of operations at these foundries for
any reason, including other natural disasters such as fires or floods, as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our
products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We
are also dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly, test and shipment services. Any prolonged inability to obtain wafers or assembly, test or shipment services with competitive
performance cost attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Competition

Our future success depends on our ability to be competitive in the semiconductor industry. See "Competition" in Item 1. "Business."

Intellectual Property

We rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We cannot assure you that such intellectual property rights can
be successfully asserted in the
future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to
technologies that are important to us. We cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future, that assertions by third parties will not result in costly
litigation or that we would prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation, regardless of its outcome,
could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations.

Litigation

We are currently engaged in several legal matters. See Item 3. "Legal Proceedings."


ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving
principal and meeting liquidity needs. The portfolio includes tax-advantaged municipal bonds, tax-advantaged auction rate securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds and U.S.
Treasury securities. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. These securities are
subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market interest rates compared to interest rates at
April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003 would not materially affect the fair value of our available-for-sale securities and the impact on our investment portfolio would
be less than $10 million for each fiscal year.

Foreign Currency Risk

Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Gains
and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained, are deferred and included
in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses
in the consolidated statement of operations as they are incurred We did not execute material hedge transactions during fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004.

We
will enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas monthly operating expenses when deemed appropriate.

Our
investments in several subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at each quarter end during
consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments. These fluctuations are recorded within stockholders'
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). In addition, as our subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in other than local currencies, exchange rate fluctuations
will occur. A hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003 would not materially affect our
financial position or results of operations.

Our
investment in UMC consists of shares, the value of which is determined by the Taiwan Stock Exchange. This value is converted from new Taiwan dollars into U.S. dollars and included in our
determination of the change in the fair value of our investment in UMC which is accounted for under the provisions of SFAS 115. The market value of our investment in UMC was approximately
$324 million at April 3, 2004 as compared to our adjusted cost basis of approximately $239 million.

XILINX, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Nature of Operations

Xilinx designs, develops and markets complete programmable logic solutions, including advanced integrated circuits, software design tools, predefined system functions delivered
as intellectual property cores, design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. The wafers used to manufacture its products are obtained from independent wafer
manufacturers located in Taiwan, Japan and the United States. The Company is dependent on these foundries to produce and deliver wafers on a timely basis. The Company is also dependent on
subcontractors, located in the Asia Pacific region, to provide semiconductor assembly, test and shipment services. Xilinx is a global company with manufacturing and test facilities in the United
States and Ireland and sales offices throughout the world. The Company derives over one-half its revenues from international sales, primarily in Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xilinx and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany
transactions. The Company uses a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2004 was a 53-week year ended on April 3,
2004. The additional week included in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 did not have a material effect on the results of operations. Fiscal 2003 was
a 52-week year ended on March 29, 2003. Fiscal 2002 was a 52-week year ended on March 30, 2002. Fiscal 2005 will be a 52-week year ending on
April 2, 2005.

The
consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2002 includes a reclassification of the Altera Corporation lawsuit settlement received of $19.4 million from a separate line after operating
income (loss) to a separate line before operating income (loss). Certain other amounts from the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Such estimates relate to, among others, the useful lives of assets, assessment of recoverability of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, inventory
write-downs, allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, potential reserves relating to litigation and tax matters as well as other accruals or reserves. Actual results may differ from
those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Short-term investments consist of tax-advantaged
municipal bonds, commercial paper, and tax-advantaged auction rate securities with maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year from the balance sheet date.
Long-term investments consist of U.S. Treasury notes, corporate bonds, government agency bonds, tax-advantaged municipal bonds with maturities greater than one year, unless the
investments are specifically identified to fund current operations, in which case they are classified as short-term investments, and equity investments.

The
Company invests its cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments through various banks and investment banking and asset management institutions. This
diversification of risk is consistent with its policy to maintain liquidity and ensure the ability to collect principal. The Company maintains an offshore investment portfolio denominated in U.S.
dollars with investments in non-U.S. based issuers. All investments are made pursuant to corporate investment policy guidelines. Investments include commercial paper, Euro dollar bonds,
Euro dollar floaters (Euro dollar bonds with coupon resets at predetermined intervals) and offshore money market funds.


Management
classifies investments as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designation at
each balance sheet date, although classification is not generally changed. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and the
ability to hold the securities until maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.
Such amortization, as well as any interest on the securities, is included in interest income. No investments were classified as held-to-maturity at April 3, 2004 or
March 29, 2003. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, included as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on
available-for-sale securities are included in interest income and other, net. The fair values for marketable debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. The
cost of securities matured or sold is based on the specific identification method.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method), or market (estimated net realizable value) and are
comprised of the following at fiscal year-ends:



(In thousands)

Raw materials

$

8,651

38,313

$

102,454

$

111,504

The
Company reviews and sets standard costs quarterly at current manufacturing costs. The Company's manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full
absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes. Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product life cycles, the Company writes down inventory to net
realizable value based on backlog, forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and
changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. In addition, backlog is subject to revisions, cancellations and rescheduling. Actual demand may differ from
forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on the Company's gross margins.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of two to five years for machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures and up to 30 years for buildings.
Depreciation expense totaled $53.7 million, $52.2 million and $51.7 million for fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company sold excess facilities consisting of two buildings and land near downtown San Jose, California for $33.8 million ($32.0 million, net
of selling costs). After recognizing previous impairment losses on these excess facilities of $53.8 million in fiscal 2003 and $3.4 million in fiscal 2004, there was no gain or loss on
the sale of the buildings and land.

During
fiscal 2003, the Company sold its former software facility in Boulder, Colorado for $6.5 million and recognized a gain of $508 thousand, which is included in interest income and
other, net on the consolidated statement of operations.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and acquired intangibles including goodwill on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment
indicators arise. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to long-lived assets. In the event such
cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows
attributable to the assets. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, Xilinx estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value.


Effective
the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company completed the adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142). As required by
SFAS 142, the Company stopped amortizing the remaining balances of goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. Goodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or earlier if indicators of
potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. All other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under
SFAS 144. The Company completed the initial goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of fiscal 2003, and completed the annual review during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and fiscal
2004, and found no impairment. Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for RocketChips and Triscend will be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

A
reconciliation of previously reported net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill amortization, is as follows:

Revenue Recognition

Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to
distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to customers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the end
customer. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment at which point the Company has a legally
enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms.

Revenue
from sales to the Company's direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection
of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, there are no customer acceptance requirements and there
are no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there were no formal acceptance provisions with the Company's direct customers.

Revenue
from software term licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is provided.

Allowances
for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending customer returns or allowances.

Foreign Currency Translation

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company's Ireland manufacturing facility. Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are
remeasured into U.S. dollars, and the resulting gains or losses are included in interest income and other, net.

The
functional currency is the local currency for each of the Company's other foreign subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at
month-end exchange rates and statements of operations are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Exchange gains or losses arising from translation of foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.


Derivative Financial Instruments

As part of the Company's ongoing asset and liability management activities, it periodically enters into financial arrangements to reduce financial market risks. Xilinx may use
derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency, equity and interest rate market exposures of underlying assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. For fiscal years 2004 and 2003, the use of derivative financial instruments was not material to the Company's results of operations or its financial
position and there were no outstanding derivative financial instruments as of April 3, 2004 or March 29, 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under Accounting Principles Board's Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related
interpretations, using the intrinsic value method. In addition, the Company has adopted the disclosure requirements related to its stock plans according to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS 123), as amended by SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure" (SFAS 148).

As
required by SFAS 148, the following table shows the estimated effect on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS 123 to stock-based compensation:

The
fair values of stock options and stock purchase plan rights under the stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan were estimated as of the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model was originally developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and requires the input of highly subjective assumptions
including expected stock price volatility. The Company's stock options and stock purchase plan rights have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Calculated under SFAS 123, the per share weighted-average fair values of stock options granted during 2004, 2003 and
2002 were $13.38, $19.73 and $19.22, respectively. The per share weighted-average fair values of stock purchase rights granted under the Stock Purchase Plan during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $12.53,
$10.10 and $16.13, respectively. The fair value of stock options and stock purchase plan rights granted in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were estimated at the date of grant using no expected
dividends and the following weighted average assumptions:

On
March 31, 2004, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft (ED), "Share-Based Payment—An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95." The proposed Statement
addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on
the fair value of the enterprise's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The proposed Statement would eliminate the ability to account for share-based
compensation transactions using APB 25, and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based method. As proposed, companies would be
required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share-based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans. As proposed, the new rules would be
applied on a modified prospective basis as defined in the ED, and would be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. Current estimates of option values
using the Black Scholes method (as shown above) may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted in the final rules.

Income Taxes

All income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method under SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" which amends and clarifies accounting
for derivative instruments and hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 149). SFAS 149 provides guidance
relating to decisions made (a) as part of the Derivatives Implementation Group process, (b) in connection with other FASB projects dealing with financial instruments and
(c) regarding implementation issues raised in the application of the definition of a derivative and
the characteristics of a derivative that contains financing components. SFAS 149 was effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after
June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

In
May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," (SFAS 150) which requires
freestanding financial instruments such as mandatorily redeemable shares, forward purchase contracts and written put options to be reported as liabilities by their issuers. The provisions of
SFAS 150 were effective for instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and to pre-existing instruments as of June 29, 2003. The adoption of
SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

In
May 2003, Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No 00-21, "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables," (EITF 00-21) was finalized. EITF
00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF
00-21 apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," which codifies and rescinds certain sections of SAB No. 101, "Revenue Recognition", in order to make this interpretive guidance
consistent with EITF No. 00-21. The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

In
December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51" ("FIN 46R" or the "Interpretation").
FIN 46R clarifies the application of ARB No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial
interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties, including the equity holders. FIN
46R requires the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest entities ("VIEs"), by the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary


beneficiary
is the entity, if any, that will absorb a majority of the entity's expected losses, receive a majority of the entity's expected residual returns, or both.

Among
other changes, the revisions of FIN 46R (a) clarified some requirements of the original FIN 46, which had been issued in January 2003, (b) eased some implementation
problems, and (c) added new scope exceptions. FIN 46R deferred the effective date of the Interpretation for Xilinx, to the period ended April 3, 2004, except that the Company applied the
unmodified provisions of the Interpretation to entities that were previously considered "special-purpose entities" in practice and under the FASB literature prior to the issuance of FIN 46R for the
period ended January 3, 2004.

Among
the scope exceptions, companies are not required to apply the modified Interpretation to an entity that meets the criteria to be considered a "business" as defined in the Interpretation unless
one or more of four specified conditions exist. FIN 46R applies immediately to a VIE created or acquired after January 31, 2003. The Company does not have any interests in VIEs.

Product Warranty and Indemnification

The Company generally sells products with a limited warranty for product quality. The Company provides for known product issues and an estimate of incurred but unidentified
product issues based on historical activity. The warranty accrual and related expense for known product issues, which were not significant for fiscal 2003, increased in fiscal 2004 predominately due
to a specific quality incident with one of our vendors. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's product warranty liability, which is included in other accrued liabilities on the
Company's consolidated balance sheet, for fiscal 2004:

The
Company generally sells its products with a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to the Company's products. Xilinx has
historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these provisions and has not been requested to make any significant payments pursuant to these provisions.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

As of April 3, 2004, two distributors (Memec and Avnet) accounted for 59% and 22% of total accounts receivable, respectively. As of March 29, 2003, Memec and
Avnet accounted for 49% and 34% of total accounts receivable, respectively. Memec accounted for 47%, 45% and 44% of worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Avnet accounted
for 31%, 32% and 30% of worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its distributors and believes their sales to
diverse end customers and to diverse geographies further serve to mitigate the Company's exposure to credit risk.

Xilinx
is subject to concentrations of credit risk primarily in its trade accounts receivable and investments in debt securities to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance
sheet. The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables through its credit evaluation process, collection terms, distributor sales to diverse end customers
and through geographical dispersion of sales. Xilinx generally does not require collateral for receivables from its end customers or from distributors. In the event of termination of a distributor
agreement, inventory held by the distributor must be returned.

No
end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.

The
Company mitigates concentrations of credit risk in its investments in debt securities by investing more than 90% of its portfolio in AA or higher grade securities as rated by Standard &
Poor's. Additionally, Xilinx limits its investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and attempts to further mitigate credit risk by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer.
At April 3, 2004, 55% and 45% of its


investments
in debt securities were domestic and foreign, respectively, and 39% were issued by corporate entities and 61% by government agencies and municipalities.

Note 3. Investment in United Microelectronics Corporation

In September 1995, Xilinx, UMC and other parties entered into a joint venture to construct a wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan, known as USIC. The Company made a
total cumulative cash investment of $107.1 million in USIC. The investment entitled Xilinx to receive up to 31.25% of USIC's wafer capacity.

In
January 2000, USIC merged into UMC and Xilinx's equity position in USIC converted into shares of UMC, which are publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. As a result of this merger,
Xilinx received approximately 222 million shares of UMC common stock, which represent approximately 2% of the combined UMC Group, and the Company recognized a non-cash gain of
$674.7 million ($398.1 million net of taxes) in fiscal 2000. Since the merger, Xilinx has received a total of approximately 145 million UMC shares in four separate annual stock
dividend distributions increasing the Company's investment holdings to approximately 367 million shares. The Company retains wafer capacity rights in UMC equivalent to those it previously had
in USIC, so long as it retains a certain percentage of its original UMC shares. If the Company's holdings fall below the specified level, its wafer capacity rights would be prorated in accordance with
the UMC shares held.

Restrictions
on the sale of these shares, imposed by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange, began to expire in July 2000 and fully expired in January 2004. As of April 3, 2004, the
entire UMC investment was unrestricted.

The
Company accounts for its investment in UMC as available-for-sale marketable securities in accordance with SFAS 115. At March 29, 2003, the restricted portion
of the investment in UMC was accounted for as a cost method investment.

The
fair value of the Company's UMC shares declined to $239.0 million as of September 29, 2001. Because of the continued downturn in the global economy, in general, and in the technology
sector in particular, the Company believed that the decline in the market value of its investment in UMC as of September 29, 2001 was other than temporary. Accordingly, during this second
quarter of fiscal 2002, Xilinx recognized a pre-tax impairment loss on its investment in UMC of $191.9 million ($113.2 million, net of tax) to reflect this
other-than-temporary decline in market value. The fair value of the Company's unrestricted UMC shares subsequently increased by $141.4 million during the third and
fourth quarters of fiscal 2002, increasing the total value of its UMC investment to $380.4 million at March 30, 2002. Under the provisions of SFAS 115, the Company increased the
value of the UMC investment by $141.4 million, recognized deferred tax liabilities of $58.0 million and increased accumulated other comprehensive income by $83.4 million.

At
March 29, 2003, the Company's equity investment in UMC shares was valued at $209.3 million on the Company's consolidated balance sheet reflecting a $171.1 million decrease in
value during fiscal 2003. Under SFAS 115, the Company decreased the value of its UMC investment by $171.1 million, recognized a deferred tax benefit of $70.2 million and decreased
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by $100.9 million. As of March 29, 2003, the market value of the total UMC investment was $29.7 million below its adjusted cost of
$239.0 million. The Company deemed the decline in value of its total investment in UMC to be temporary in nature.

The
following table summarizes the cost basis and carrying values of the restricted and unrestricted portions of the investment in UMC:

Note 6. Impairment Losses

The impairment loss on excess facilities and equipment recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 of $54.7 million related primarily to excess facilities owned
in San Jose, California. The Company lost a potential long-term arrangement to lease the facilities during the third quarter of fiscal 2003, leaving the Company with no
near-term leasing alternatives or prospects for sale. The amount of the impairment was based on management's evaluation of future cash flows and an independent appraisal obtained during
the third quarter of fiscal 2003.

During
the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company received a purchase offer from a prospective buyer for an amount less than the facilities' net book value of $35.4 million. In connection
with the offer, management determined the facilities should be reclassified from "held for use" to "held for sale" reflecting management's expectation that the facilities would be sold. An additional
impairment charge of $3.4 million was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company sold the facilities for $33.8 million
($32.0 million, net of selling costs), resulting in no additional loss or gain.

The
impairment loss on investments of $10.4 million and $4.3 million recognized during fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively, related to non-marketable equity securities in
private companies. Of the $4.3 million of impairment loss on investments in fiscal 2002, $2.8 million is separately disclosed and $1.5 million was included in research and
development expenses on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

During
fiscal year 2002, the Company recognized impairment losses on intangible assets and equipment totaling approximately $25.3 million. The total includes $14.9 million of charges
relating to goodwill and other intangible assets associated with a number of technology acquisitions completed during fiscal 2001 and 2000 and $10.4 million for the write-down of
excess testers that provided no future economic benefit as they were acquired in anticipation of higher unit growth.

Note 7. Commitments

Xilinx leases some of its facilities and office buildings under operating leases that expire at various dates through December 2014. Some of the operating leases require
payment of operating costs, including property taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance. Approximate future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows:

Most
of the Company's leases contain renewal options. Rent expense under all operating leases was approximately $4.6 million for fiscal 2004, $3.4 million for fiscal 2003
and $5.4 million for fiscal 2002.

Other
commitments at April 3, 2004 totaled $97.0 million and consist of purchases of inventory and other purchase obligations related to subcontractors that manufacture silicon wafers
and provide assembly and test services. The Company expects to receive and pay for the materials and services in the next three to six months.

Note 8. Net Income (Loss) Per Share

The computation of basic net income (loss) per share for all periods presented is derived from the information on the consolidated statements of operations, and there are no
reconciling items in the numerator used to compute diluted net income (loss) per share. The total shares used in the denominator of the diluted net income (loss) per share calculation includes
13.1 million and 11.6 million common equivalent shares attributable to outstanding stock options for fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively, that are not included in basic net income
(loss) per share. For fiscal 2002, 18.0 million common stock equivalents attributable to the Company's stock option plans were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, as
they were antidilutive.

Outstanding
out-of-the-money stock options to purchase approximately 21.1 million, 22.9 million and 8.8 million shares, for fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively, under the Company's stock option plans were excluded by the treasury stock calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share. These options could be dilutive in the future if
the Company's average share price increases and is equal to or greater than the exercise price of these options.

Note 9. Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period resulting from certain transactions and other events and circumstances, excluding
transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The difference between net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) for the Company is from unrealized gains
(losses) on its available-for-sale securities, net of taxes, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The components of comprehensive income (loss) are as follows

The

value of the UMC investment since March 29, 2003 (see Note 3). In addition, the value of the Company's short-term and long-term investments increased by
$3.1 million during fiscal 2004. In accordance with SFAS 115, the Company increased the value of these investments by $3.1 million, increased deferred tax liabilities by
$1.2 million and increased accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by $1.9 million.


Note 10. Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock

The Company's Certificate of Incorporation authorized 2 million shares of undesignated preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. The
Board of Directors is authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of preferred stock. As of
April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003, no preferred shares were issued or outstanding.

Common Stock Repurchase Program

The Board of Directors has approved stock repurchase programs enabling the Company to repurchase its common stock. In June 2002, the Board authorized the repurchase of
up to an additional $100 million of common stock. These share repurchase programs have no stated expiration date. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company repurchased a total of
1.9 million, 2.4 million and 2.2 million shares of common stock for $62.8 million, $60.4 million and $126.2 million, respectively. In fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, 1.9 million, 2.4 million and 3.5 million shares were reissued, respectively, for employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan requirements. Through
April 3, 2004, the Company had repurchased $91.7 million of the $100 million of common stock approved for repurchase under the current program. As of April 3, 2004, the
Company held approximately 27 thousand shares of treasury stock in conjunction with the stock repurchase program and approximately 21 thousand shares as of March 29, 2003.

Put Options

During fiscal 2002, Xilinx sold put options that entitled the holder of each option to sell to the Company, by physical delivery, one share of common stock at specified prices.
The cash proceeds from the sale of put options of $3.0 million for fiscal 2002 have been included in additional paid-in capital following the provisions of EITF Issue
No. 00-19, "Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock." During fiscal 2003, the final put options were presented
to Xilinx requiring the Company to acquire 300 thousand shares at strike prices ranging from $40 to $45 per share. As of April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003, no shares of common
stock were subject to future issuance under outstanding put options.

Employee Stock Option Plans

Under existing stock option plans (Option Plans), options reserved for future issuance to employees and directors of the Company total 86.8 million shares as of
April 3, 2004, including 28.7 million shares available for future grants. Options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock under the Option Plans are granted at 100% of the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options granted to date expire ten years from date of grant and vest at varying rates over two or four years.

The
above table does not include additional shares that become available under a quasi-evergreen program. This program, approved by stockholders in 1999, permits the Company to
increase the amount available for issuance under the 1997 Stock Plan for each of five years commencing with fiscal year 2000 by an amount equal to the lesser of 20 million shares or 4% of the
number of shares outstanding as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year, as adjusted for splits, stock dividends and certain other changes to the outstanding capital stock of the Company or an
amount determined by the Board of Directors. On April 8, 2004, the Board approved the addition of 13.6 million shares increasing the total amount of shares available for grant to
42.3 million under the Company's employee stock option plans. This 13.6 million share allotment marks the end of the Company's quasi-evergreen program.

Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan

Under the Company's 1990 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (Stock Purchase Plan), qualified employees can elect to have up to 15 percent of their annual earnings
withheld, up to a maximum of $21,250, to purchase the Company's common stock at the end of six-month enrollment periods. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the fair
market value at the beginning of the twenty-four month offering period or at the end of each six-month purchase period. Almost all employees are eligible to participate.
Employees purchased 1.7 million shares for $27.0 million in fiscal 2004, 1.6 million shares for $25.6 million in fiscal 2003 and 700 thousand shares for
$22.8 million in fiscal 2002. At April 3, 2004, 4.0 million shares were available for future issuance out of 27.5 million shares authorized.

The
tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan were $109 million, $17 million and $52 million, for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Such benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital when realized. The Company has federal and state tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$454 million and $83 million, respectively. If unused, these tax loss carryforwards and $61 million of the tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2007 through 2024. Pretax income
from foreign operations was $387 million, $185 million and $14 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Unremitted foreign earnings that are considered to be
permanently invested outside the United States and on which no U.S. taxes have been provided, accumulated to approximately $482 million as of April 3, 2004. The residual U.S. tax
liability, if such amounts were remitted, would be approximately $121 million.

The
provision (benefit) for income taxes reconciles to the amount obtained by applying the Federal statutory income tax rate to income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes as follows:

The

The
IRS has audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Company for fiscal years 1996 through 2001. To date, several issues have been settled with the Appeals Office of the IRS. As of
April 3, 2004, unresolved issues asserted by the IRS total $19.0 million in additional taxes due, including penalties and a reduction of future net operating losses of
$31.2 million.

The
Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court on March 26, 2001, in response to assertions by the IRS that the Company owed additional tax for fiscal years 1996 through 1998. Several
issues, including the arm's length royalty issue discussed below, have been settled with the Appeals Office of the IRS.

In
October 2002, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency for fiscal year 1999. The notice of deficiency was based on issues that were also asserted in the previous notice of deficiency for fiscal
years 1996 through 1998. On January 14, 2003, the Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court in response to the October 2002 notice of deficiency.

In
October 2003, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency for fiscal year 2000. The notice of deficiency was based on issues that were also asserted in the previous notices of deficiency for
fiscal years 1996 through 1999. In addition, the IRS disallowed a carryback of general business credits from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 1995. The Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court
on January 16, 2004, in response to the October 2003 notice of deficiency.

On
April 6, 2004, Xilinx filed a settlement stipulation concerning the arm's length royalty for the license between the Company and Xilinx Ireland for fiscal years 1996 through 1999. On
April 29, 2004, the Company filed a settlement stipulation concerning the arm's length royalty for the license between the Company and Xilinx Ireland for fiscal year 2000. The IRS agreed not to
increase Xilinx's taxable income for this issue. The IRS had asserted increased taxable income of $242 million for fiscal years 1996 through 1999 and $57 million for fiscal year 2000.

One
of the unresolved issues relates to whether the value of compensatory stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Company and the IRS filed cross motions
for summary judgment in 2002 relating to this stock option cost sharing issue. In March 2003, the IRS changed its position concerning the treatment of stock options in cost sharing agreements.
The IRS now excludes stock options granted prior to the beginning of the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The IRS


change
in position reduced the amount originally at issue on the treatment of stock options in cost sharing agreements, which was the subject of the summary judgment motions. On October 28,
2003, the Tax Court issued an order denying both Xilinx's and the IRS's cross motions for summary judgment on the stock option cost sharing issue. The order stated that evidence is necessary to
establish whether the stock options are a cost related to research and development and to determine whether unrelated parties would share the cost of stock options in a cost sharing agreement. The
Court has granted an IRS motion to amend its answer to assert an alternative deficiency based on the Black-Scholes value of stock options on grant. The trial for this issue has been set for
July 14, 2004, and fiscal year 1999 has been combined with fiscal years 1997 to 1998.

Xilinx
is in discussions with the Appeals Office to resolve and settle the remaining issues, other than the stock option cost sharing issue discussed above. It is premature to comment further on the
likely outcome of any issues that have not been settled to date. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the remaining adjustments and sufficient taxes have been provided.

Note 12. Segment Information

Xilinx designs, develops, and markets programmable logic semiconductor devices and the related software design tools. The Company operates and tracks its results in one
operating segment.

Enterprise
wide information is provided in accordance with SFAS 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." Geographic revenue information for fiscal years 2004,
2003 and 2002 is based on the shipment location. Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and goodwill. Property, plant and equipment information is based on the physical
location of the asset at the end of each fiscal year while goodwill is based on the location of the owning entity.

Note 13. Contingencies

The
Company filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court on March 26, 2001 and January 14, 2003 in response to assertions by the IRS that the Company owed additional tax for fiscal years 1996
through 1999. The Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court on January 16, 2004, in response to assertions by the IRS that the Company owes additional tax for fiscal year 2000 (see
Note 11). Other than these petitions, Xilinx knows of no legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or agency against the Company.


In
March 2002, Aldec, Inc. (Aldec) filed a complaint in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, alleging copyright infringement and breach of contract by the
Company arising from the expiration of a license agreement for certain Aldec software. Aldec sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) simultaneous with the filing of its complaint. The Court denied
the request for a TRO. On September 2, 2003, the Company settled all outstanding litigation with Aldec for an amount that was immaterial to the Company's results of operations or its financial
condition.

In
fiscal year 2004, the Company allowed sales representative agreements with three related European entities, Rep'tronic S.A., Rep'tronic España, and Acsis S.r.l., a Rep'tronic Company
(collectively Rep'tronic) to expire pursuant to their terms. In May 2003, Rep'tronic filed lawsuits in the High Court of Ireland against the Company claiming compensation arising from
termination of an alleged commercial agency between Rep'tronic and the Company. On March 31, 2004, Rep'tronic amended each of its statements of claim to include an additional claim related to
the termination of the alleged commercial agency. The Company has not yet been required to file its defense and no significant discovery has occurred.

On
January 21, 2004, Rep'tronic S.A. joined Xilinx SARL into a lawsuit before the Labor Court of Versailles brought by five former Rep'tronic S.A. employees against Rep'tronic S.A. for unfair
dismissal. Rep'tronic S.A. is seeking indemnification from Xilinx SARL on the theory that the employees of Rep'tronic S.A. became the employees of Xilinx SARL or Xilinx Ireland upon the expiration of
the sales representative agreement. Xilinx SARL will file its evidence on July 14, 2004. A hearing has been set for September 20, 2004.

On
February 10, 2004, Rep'tronic S.A. filed a lawsuit against Xilinx SARL in the Commercial Court of Versailles. The lawsuit is pled as an unfair competition matter but the claims and the facts
upon which they are based are essentially the same as the commercial agency claims being addressed before the High Court of Ireland. Xilinx SARL has filed its defense. No hearing has been set.

The
Company has accrued amounts that represent anticipated payments for liability for the Rep'tronic litigation under the provisions of SFAS 5.

Except
as stated above, there are no pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the Company is a party or of which any of its property is the subject.

Note 14. Business Combinations

Triscend Corporation

In March 2004, Xilinx completed the acquisition of Triscend Corporation (Triscend), a privately held fabless semiconductor company with expertise in configurable
embedded microcontroller technology. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price for Triscend was $30 million in cash plus
$1.2 million of acquisition related costs. Xilinx recorded a charge to operations upon consummation of the transaction for acquired in-process research and development of
approximately $7 million. In addition, Xilinx recorded approximately $18.9 million of goodwill and other intangible assets, which resulted in amortization expense of approximately
$100 thousand in fiscal 2004. The financial results for Triscend are included in the Company's consolidated results from the date of acquisition. Pro forma information is not presented due to
the immateriality of the operating results of Triscend prior to the acquisition.


Following
is the purchase allocation based on estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Management considered a number of factors, including an independent appraisal and
expected uses of assets and dispositions of liabilities, in determining the final purchase price allocation.

Amortization
expense for all intangible assets for fiscal year 2004, 2003, and 2002 was $9.8 million, $15.3 million and $49.0 million, respectively. Intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis.

Based
on the carrying value of other intangible assets recorded at April 3, 2004, and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the annual amortization expense for other
intangible assets is expected to be as follows: 2005—$5.0 million; 2006—$4.4 million; 2007—$3.6 million; 2008—$2.5 million;
2009—$1.3 million.

Note 16. Subsequent Events

On April 22, 2004, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of common stock.

On
April 22, 2004, the Board of Directors declared the Company's first quarterly common stock dividend, of $0.05 per share, which is payable on June 2, 2004 to stockholders of record at
the close of business on May 12, 2004.


REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Xilinx, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xilinx, Inc. as of April 3, 2004 and March 29, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 3, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Xilinx, Inc. at April 3, 2004 and
March 29, 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 3, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective at the beginning of fiscal 2003, Xilinx adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets."

ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. These controls and procedures are also designed to
ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal controls are procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that: transactions are properly authorized; assets are safeguarded against
unauthorized or improper use; and transactions are properly recorded and reported, to permit the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

A
control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with its policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and not be detected. We continuously evaluate our internal controls and make changes to improve them.

We
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K
(Controls Evaluation Date),under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our CEO and CFO. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, while no
cost-effective control system will preclude all errors and irregularities, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and other disclosures in our SEC reports are reliable.

From
the Controls Evaluation Date to the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that
could significantly affect internal controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

In
November 2000, the Company acquired RocketChips. Under the terms of the merger, the Company assumed all of the stock options previously issued to RocketChips' employees
pursuant to four different stock option plans. A total of approximately 807,000 options were assumed by the Company. Of this amount, a total of 342,949 options, with an average weighted exercise price
of $15.18, remained outstanding as of April 3, 2004. These options are excluded from the above table. All of the options assumed by the Company remain subject to the terms of the RocketChips'
stock option plan under which they were issued. Subsequent to acquiring RocketChips, the Company has not made any grants or awards under any of the RocketChips' stock option plans and the Company has
no intention to do so in the future.

This
number does not include additional shares that become available under a quasi-evergreen program. This program, approved by stockholders in 1999, permits the Company to increase
the amount available for issuance under the 1997 Stock Plan for each of five years commencing with fiscal year 2000 by an amount equal to the lesser of 20 million shares or 4% of the number of
shares outstanding as of the beginning of the prior fiscal year, as adjusted for splits, stock dividends and certain other changes to the outstanding capital stock of the Company or an amount
determined by the Board of Directors. On April 8, 2004, the Board approved the addition of 13.6 million shares increasing the total amount of shares available for grant to
42.3 million including 40.1 million shares from the 1997 Stock Plan and 2.2 million shares from the Supplemental Stock Option Plan. This 13.6 million share allotment marks
the end of the Company's quasi-evergreen program.

Our
Supplemental Stock Option Plan, which was not subject to stockholder approval, is intended to help us attract and retain outstanding individuals in order to promote the success of
the Company's business. The plan permits stock options to be granted to employees and consultants of the Company, except that our officers and members of our Board of Directors may not be granted
options under the plan. The number of shares that may be issued pursuant to options granted under the plan is 2.2 million, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and certain
other changes to the outstanding capital stock of the Company. Only non-qualified stock options may be granted under the plan (that is, options that do not entitle the optionee to special
U.S. income tax treatment). The plan is administered by the Compensation Committee, which has broad discretion to set the terms of options (including the number of shares, exercise price, vesting
conditions and terms of options), to determine to whom they will be granted, to interpret the plan and the option agreements and to take such other actions and make such other determinations as it
determines necessary or advisable in the administration of the plan. Subject to the foregoing, options granted under the plan generally expire not later than 12 months after the optionee ceases
to be an employee or consultant. Upon a merger of the Company with or into another company, or the sale of substantially all of the Company's assets, each option outstanding under the plan may be
assumed or substituted with a similar option by the acquiring company, or the outstanding options will become exercisable in connection with the merger or sale. Our Board of Directors is authorized at
any time to amend, alter, suspend or terminate the plan, but no such change may impair the rights of any option recipient under the plan without the written consent of the participant and the Company.
