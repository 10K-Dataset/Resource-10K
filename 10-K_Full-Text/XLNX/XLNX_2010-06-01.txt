ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx, the Company or we) designs, develops and markets programmable platforms.
These programmable platforms have several components:

•

integrated circuits (ICs) in the form of programmable logic devices (PLDs);

•

software design tools to program the PLDs;

•

targeted reference designs;

•

printed circuit boards; and

•

intellectual property (IP) cores.

In addition to its programmable platforms, Xilinx provides design services, customer training,
field engineering and technical support.

Our PLDs include field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices
(CPLDs) that our customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our products are designed
to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end
markets such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, aerospace
and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing. We sell our
products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by a network of independent sales representative firms and
by a direct sales management organization.

Xilinx was founded and incorporated in California in February 1984. In April 1990, the Company
reincorporated in Delaware. Our corporate facilities and executive offices are located at 2100
Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124, and our website address is www.xilinx.com.

Industry Overview

There are three principal types of ICs used in most digital electronic systems: processors, which
generally are utilized for control and computing tasks; memory devices, which are used for storing
program instructions and data; and logic devices, which generally are used to manage the
interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system. Xilinx designs and develops PLDs,
a type of logic device. Alternatives to PLDs include application specific integrated circuits
(ASICs) and application specific standard products (ASSPs). PLDs, ASICs and ASSPs compete with
each other since they may be utilized in many of the same types of applications within electronic
systems. However, variations in unit pricing, development cost, product performance, reliability,
power consumption, capacity, functionality, ease of use and time-to-market determine the degree to
which the devices compete for specific applications.

Key PLD competitive advantages versus competing ASICs and ASSPs include:

•

Faster time-to-market and increased design flexibility. Both of these advantages are
enabled by Xilinx desktop software which allows users to implement and revise their designs
quickly. In contrast, ASICs and ASSPs require significant development time and offer
limited, if any, flexibility to make design changes.

•

PLDs are standard components. This means that the same device can be sold to many
different users for myriad of applications. In sharp contrast, ASICs and ASSPs are customized
for an individual user or a specific application.



PLDs are generally disadvantaged in terms of relative device size. ASICs and ASSPs tend to be
smaller than PLDs, resulting in a lower unit cost. However, there is a high fixed cost associated
with ASIC and ASSP development that is not applicable to PLD customers. This fixed cost of
development is expected to significantly increase on next generation technology nodes. From a
total cost of development perspective, ASICs and ASSPs have generally been more cost effective when
used in high-volume production; and, PLDs when used in low- to mid-volume production. However, we
expect PLDs to be able to address higher volume applications and gain market share from ASIC and
ASSP suppliers as the fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development increases on next generation
technology nodes, eroding their respective cost advantages.

An overview of typical PLD end market applications for our products is shown in the following

Strategy and Competition

Our strategy for expansion is the displacement of ASICs and ASSPs in the development of next
generation electronic systems. The costs and risks associated with application-specific devices can
only be justified for a short list of ultra-high volume commodity products. Programmable platforms,
alternatively, are becoming critical for our customers to meet increasingly stringent product
requirements — cost, power, performance, and density — in a business environment characterized by
increased complexity, shrinking market windows, rapidly changing market demands, capped engineering
budgets, escalating ASIC and ASSP non-recurring engineering costs, and increased risk.

With every new generation of FPGAs, our strategy is to increase the performance, densities and
system-level functionality, while driving down cost and power consumption, at each manufacturing
process node. Secondly, our strategy is to provide simpler, smarter programmable platforms and
design methodologies that free up engineers to focus on end product innovation and differentiation.



Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and
characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence
and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors,
Altera Corporation (Altera), Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) and Actel Corporation
(Actel), from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs, from the ASSP
market, and from new companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market segment.
Other competitors include manufacturers of:

•

high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;

•

high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;

•

ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic;

•

high-speed, low-density CPLDs;

•

high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) devices;

•

products with embedded processors;

•

products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; and

•

other new or emerging programmable logic products.

We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include:

•

product pricing;

•

time-to-market;

•

product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density;

•

field upgradability;

•

adaptability of products to specific applications;

•

ease of use and functionality of software design tools;

•

availability and functionality of predefined IP cores of logic;

•

inventory management;

•

access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity; and

•

ability to provide timely customer service and support.

CPLDs

CPLDs operate on the lowest end of the programmable logic density spectrum. CPLDs are single-chip,
nonvolatile solutions characterized by instant-on and universal interconnect. CPLDs combine the
advantages of ultra low power consumption with the benefits of high performance and low cost.
Prior generations of CPLDs include the CoolRunner and XC9500 product families.

EasyPath

™

FPGAs

EasyPath FPGAs offer customers a fast, simple method of cost-reducing FPGA designs. EasyPath FPGAs
use the same production masks and fabrication process as standard FPGAs and are tested to a
specific customer application to improve yield and lower costs. As a result, EasyPath FPGAs
provide customers with significant cost reduction when compared to the standard FPGA devices
without the conversion risk, conversion engineering effort or the additional time required to move
to an ASIC. The latest generation of EasyPath FPGAs, EasyPath-6 FPGAs, provide lower total product
cost of ownership for cost-reducing high performance FPGAs.

Design Platforms and Services

Programmable Platforms

We offer three types of programmable platforms that support our customers’ designs and reduce their
development efforts:

The Base Platform is the delivery vehicle for all new silicon offerings used to develop and run
customer-specific software applications and hardware designs. Released at launch, the Base
Platform is comprised of: FPGA silicon; ISE

®

(Integrated Software Environment) Design Suite design
environment; integration support of optional third-party synthesis, simulation, and signal
integrity tools; reference designs; development boards and IP cores.



The Domain-Specific Platform targets one of the three primary Xilinx FPGA user profiles: the
embedded processing developer; the DSP developer; or the logic/connectivity developer. It
accomplishes this by augmenting the Base Platform with a targeted set of integrated technologies,
including: higher-level design methodologies and tools; domain-specific IP including embedded, DSP
and connectivity; domain-specific development hardware and reference designs; and operating systems
and software.

The Market-Specific Platform enables software or hardware developers to quickly build and run their
specific application or solution. Built for specific markets such as automotive, consumer,
aerospace and defense, communications, audio, video and broadcast, industrial, or scientific and
medical, the Market-Specific Platform integrates both the Base and Domain-Specific Platforms with
higher targeted applications elements such as IP, reference designs and boards optimized for a
particular market.

Design Tools

To accommodate the various design methodologies and design flows employed by the wide range of our
customers’ user profiles such as system designers, algorithm designers, software coders and logic
designers, we provide the appropriate design environment tailored to each user profile for design
creation, design implementation and design verification.

The Xilinx ISE Design Suite features a complete tool chain for the three domain-specific
categories: embedded, DSP and logic/connectivity. To further enhance productivity and help
customers better manage the complexity of their designs, the ISE Design Suite enables designers to
target area, performance, or power by simply selecting a design goal in the setup. The Xilinx ISE
Design Suite also integrates with a wide range of third-party electronic design automation (EDA)
software point-tools offerings.

Intellectual Property

Xilinx and various third parties offer hundreds of free and for-license IP components to accelerate
our customers’ time to market, including a host of widely used IP such as Ethernet, memory
controllers, and PCIe

®

, as well as an abundance of domain-specific IP in the areas of embedded, DSP
and connectivity, as well as market-specific IP. In addition, we have announced a partnership
agreement with ARM

®

to define the next-generation ARM AMBA

®

AXI-4 interconnect technology that is
enhanced and optimized for FPGA architectures to facilitate plug-and-play FPGA design and take
advantage of the large ecosystem of ARM IP developers.

Development Boards, Kits and Configuration Products

In addition to the broad selection of legacy development boards presently offered, we have
introduced a new unified board strategy that enables the creation of a standardized and coordinated
set of base boards available both from Xilinx and our ecosystem partners, all utilizing the
industry-standard extensions that enable customization for market specific applications. Adopting
this standard for all of our base boards enables the creation of a unified, scalable and extensible
delivery mechanism for all Xilinx programmable platforms.

We also offer comprehensive development kits including hardware, design tools, IP and reference
designs that are designed to streamline and accelerate the development of domain-specific and
market-specific applications.

Finally, Xilinx offers a range of configuration products including one-time programmable and
in-system programmable storage devices to configure Xilinx FPGAs. These PROM (programmable
read-only memory) products support all of our FPGA devices.

Third-Party Alliances

Xilinx and certain third parties have developed and continue to offer a robust ecosystem of IP,
boards, tools, services, and support through the Xilinx alliance program. Xilinx also works with
these third parties to make our programmable platforms available through third-party tools, IP,
software, boards, and design services, and leveraged in customer designs.

Engineering Services

Xilinx engineering services provide customers with engineering resources to augment their design
team and to provide expert design-specific advice. Xilinx tailors its engineering services to the
needs of its customer, ranging from hands-on training to full design creation and implementation.

See information under the caption “Results of Operations — Net Revenues” in Item 7. “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information about our
revenues from our product families.



Research and Development

Our research and development (R&D) activities are primarily directed towards the design of new ICs,
the development of new software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software, the
design of logic IP cores, the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes for
ongoing cost reductions, performance and signal integrity improvements and the lowering of PLD
power consumption. As a result of our R&D efforts, we have introduced a number of new products
during the past several years including the Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families. Additionally, we have
made enhancements to our IP core offerings and introduced new versions of our ISE Design Suite. We
extended our collaboration with our foundry suppliers in the development of 65-nm, 45-nm and 40-nm
manufacturing technology and we were the first company in the PLD industry to ship 45-nm
high-volume FPGA devices.

Our R&D challenge is to continue to develop new products that create cost-effective solutions for
customers. In fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, our R&D expenses were $369.5 million, $355.4 million and
$358.1 million, respectively. We believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our
future success and we are committed to maintaining a significant level of R&D investment.

Sales and Distribution

We sell our products to OEMs and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to
OEMs or contract manufacturers.

We use dedicated global sales and marketing organizations as well as independent sales
representatives to generate sales. In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a
limited number of key accounts with independent sales representatives often addressing those
customers in defined territories. Distributors create demand within the balance of our customer
base. Distributors also provide vendor-managed inventory, value-added services and logistics for a
wide range of our OEM customers.

Whether Xilinx, the independent sales representative, or the distributor identifies the sales
opportunity, a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders. In
such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear all legal and
financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, such as credit loss, inventory
shrinkage and theft, as well as foreign currency fluctuations, but excluding indemnity and warranty
liability.

In accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted the
distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis
and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a subsequent change in list
prices. Revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products
are sold to the distributors’ end customers.

Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes the substantial majority of our products worldwide. No end
customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008. As of April
3, 2010 and March 28, 2009, Avnet accounted for 83% and 81% of the Company’s total accounts
receivable, respectively. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 49%, 55% and 61% of the
Company’s worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We also use other
regional distributors throughout the world. We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means
of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services. Since PLDs
are standard products, they do not present many of the inventory risks to distributors posed by
ASICs, and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support. From time to time, we
may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct support
model as we deem appropriate given our strategies, the level of business and distributor
performance and financial condition. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we
terminated our relationship with one of our North American-based distributors. See “Note 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk” to our consolidated
financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for
information about concentrations of credit risk and “Note 17. Segment Information” for information
about our revenues from external customers and domestic and international operations

.

Backlog

As of April 3, 2010, our backlog from OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our
distributors scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $282.0 million, compared to
$162.0 million as of March 28, 2009. Orders from end customers to our distributors are subject to
changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation without significant penalty. As a result,
backlogs from both OEM customers and end customers reported by our distributors as of any
particular period may not be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period.

Wafer Fabrication

As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture wafers used for our IC products or PROMs.
Rather, we purchase wafers from multiple foundries including United Microelectronics Corporation
(UMC), Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba), Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko), Samsung Electronics Co.,
Ltd. and He Jian Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. Currently, UMC manufactures the substantial
majority of our wafers. In February 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) to be our foundry supplier at the 28-nm
technology node.



Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers
produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by our periodic negotiations with the wafer
foundries.

Our strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs and software
design tools rather than on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance
foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well as other
suppliers of leading-edge process technologies.

Sort, Assembly and Test

Wafers purchased are sorted by the foundry or independent sort subcontractors. Sorted die are
assembled by subcontractors. During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into individual
die, which are then assembled into various package types. Following assembly, the packaged units
are generally tested by Xilinx personnel at our Singapore facility or by independent test
subcontractors. We purchase most of our assembly and some of our testing services from Siliconware
Precision Industries Ltd. in Taiwan, Amkor Technology, Inc. in Korea and the Philippines and STATS
ChipPAC Ltd. in Singapore.

Quality Certification

Xilinx has achieved quality management systems certification for ISO 9001:2000 for our facilities
in San Jose, California; Dublin, Ireland; Longmont, Colorado; Singapore and Albuquerque, New
Mexico. In addition, Xilinx achieved ISO 14001, TL 9000 and TS 16949 environmental and quality
certifications in the San Jose, Dublin and Singapore locations, TL 9000 certifications in the
Longmont and Albuquerque locations and TS 16949 certifications in the Albuquerque and Hyderabad,
India locations.

Patents and Licenses

While our various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe
our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any
particular group of patents or licenses. As of April 3, 2010, we held more than 2,300 issued
United States (U.S.) patents, which vary in duration, and over 650 pending U.S. patent applications
relating to our proprietary technology. We maintain an active program of filing for additional
patents in the areas of, but not limited to, circuits, software, IC architecture, system design,
testing methodologies and other technologies relating to PLDs. We have licensed some parties to
certain portions of our patent portfolio and obtained licenses to certain third-party patents as
well.

We have acquired various licenses from third parties to certain technologies that are implemented
in IP cores or embedded in our PLDs, such as processors. Those licenses support our continuing
ability to make and sell these PLDs to our customers. We also sublicense certain third-party
proprietary software and open-source software, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued
use of those software components is important to the operation of the design tools upon which
customers depend.

We maintain the Xilinx trade name as well as numerous trademarks and registered trademarks
including Xilinx, Virtex, Spartan, ISE and associated logos. Maintaining these rights, and the
goodwill associated with these trademarks and logos, is important to our business. We also have
license rights to use certain trademarks owned by consortiums and other trademark owners that are
related to our products and business.

We intend to protect our intellectual property vigorously. We believe that failure to enforce our
intellectual property rights (including, for example, patents, copyrights and trademarks) or
failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. We incurred, and in the future we may continue to incur,
litigation expenses to defend against claims of infringement and to enforce our intellectual
property rights against third parties. However, any such litigation may or may not be successful.

Employees

As of April 3, 2010, we had 2,948 employees compared to 3,145 as of the end of the prior fiscal
year. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work
stoppages and believe we maintain good employee relations.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should
be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks to the
Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the
Company’s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of
the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and
cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and failure to do so would
have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that
address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price, density,
functionality, power consumption and performance. The success of new product introductions is
dependent upon several factors, including:

•

timely completion of new product designs;

•

ability to generate new design opportunities or design wins;

•

availability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand
creation and customer adoption of new products;

•

ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies on circuit geometries of
45-nm and smaller;

•

achieving acceptable yields;

•

ability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and
test subcontractors;

•

ability to obtain advanced packaging;

•

availability of supporting software design tools;

•

utilization of predefined IP cores of logic;

•

customer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; and

•

market acceptance of our customers’ products.



Our product development efforts may not be successful, our new products may not achieve industry
acceptance and we may not achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per
unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the
future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we may be increasingly dependent
on revenues derived from design wins for our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions
in the manufacture of our current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and
corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new
products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to
increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and
new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our products do
not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our financial condition and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected.

We rely on independent foundries for the manufacture of all of our products and a manufacturing
problem or insufficient foundry capacity could adversely affect our operations.

Nearly all of our wafers were manufactured either in Taiwan, by United Microelectronics Corporation
(UMC), or in Japan, by Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba). In addition, the wafers for our older
products are manufactured in Japan by Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko) and the wafers for some of
our newer products are manufactured in South Korea, by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Terms with
respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the
semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations between Xilinx and these wafer
foundries, which usually result in short-term agreements that do not provide for long-term supply
or allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries, especially UMC, which supplies the
substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on UMC to produce wafers with competitive performance
and cost attributes. These attributes include an ability to transition to advanced manufacturing
process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver
them in a timely manner. We cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our wafers will not
experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing
process technologies or difficulties due to limitations of new and existing process technologies.
Furthermore, we cannot guarantee the foundries will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of
our products. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial
health and viability of the foundries and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet
their commitments to us. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we experienced supply
shortages due to the difficulties encountered by the foundries in rapidly increasing their
production capacities from low utilization levels to high utilization levels because of an
unexpected increase in demand. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we also experienced supply
shortages due to very strong demand for our products and a surge in demand for semiconductors in
general, which has led to tightening of foundry capacity across the industry. The insolvency of a
foundry or any significant manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity would disrupt our
operations and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

We have established other sources of wafer supply for many of our products in an effort to secure a
continued supply of wafers. However, establishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry
relationships require the investment of management resources as well as additional costs. If we do
not manage these relationships effectively, it could adversely affect our results of operations.

General economic conditions and the related deterioration in the global business environment could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

During the past two years, global consumer confidence eroded amidst concerns over declining asset
values, inflation, volatility in energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of
credit, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial
markets, businesses and sovereign nations, among other concerns. These concerns slowed global
economic growth and resulted in recessions in numerous countries, including many of those in North
America, Europe and Asia. These economic conditions had a negative impact on our results of
operations during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 and the first and second quarters of
fiscal 2010 due to reduced customer demand. While there have been recent improvements in global
economic conditions and our results of operations improved during the second half of fiscal 2010,
there is no guarantee that these improvements will continue in the future. If unpredictable
economic conditions persist or worsen, a number of negative effects on our business could result,
including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of key
suppliers, which could result in production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit,
and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to
effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables and ultimately decrease our net
revenues and profitability.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by cyclical market patterns and a significant industry
downturn could adversely affect our operating results.

The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and our financial performance has been affected by
downturns in the industry, including the current downturn. Down cycles are generally characterized
by price erosion and weaker demand for our products. Weaker demand for our products resulting from
economic conditions in the end markets we serve and reduced capital spending by our customers can
result, and in the past has resulted in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory
write-downs. We attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible; however, the
dynamics of the market in which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events
difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past results are not reliable predictors of our
future results.



The nature of our business makes our revenues difficult to predict which could have an adverse
impact on our business.

In addition to the challenging market conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the
demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon
our products being designed into our end customers’ products and those products achieving market
acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers’ designs, the design to volume production
process for our customers requires a substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In
addition, we are dependent upon “turns,” orders received and turned for shipment in the same
quarter. These factors make it difficult for us to forecast future sales and project quarterly
revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales impairs our ability to project our inventory
requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write-downs or failure
to timely meet customer product demands. In addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues
compromises our ability to provide forward-looking revenue and earnings guidance.

If we are not able to successfully compete in our industry, our financial results and future
prospects will be adversely affected.

Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and
characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence
and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors,
Altera, Lattice and Actel, from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of
FPGAs, from the ASSP market, and from new companies that may enter the traditional programmable
logic market segment. We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry
include:

•

product pricing;

•

time-to-market;

•

product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density;

•

field upgradeability;

•

adaptability of products to specific applications;

•

ease of use and functionality of software design tools;

•

availability and functionality of predefined IP cores of logic;

•

inventory and supply chain management;

•

access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity; and

•

ability to provide timely customer service and support.

Our strategy for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction of new product
architectures that address high-volume, low-cost and low-power applications as well as
high-performance, high-density applications. In addition, we anticipate continued price reductions
proportionate with our ability to lower the cost for established products. However, we may not be
successful in achieving these strategies.

Other competitors include manufacturers of:

•

high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;

•

high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;

•

ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic;

•

high-speed, low-density CPLDs;

•

high-performance DSP devices;

•

products with embedded processors;

•

products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; and

•

other new or emerging programmable logic products.

Several companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention
to sell PLD products. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our financial
condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to this segment. We
recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are
developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing
the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software design
tools that support the full range of our IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design
are significant competitive factors in this segment.



We could also face competition from our licensees. In the past we have granted limited rights to
other companies with respect to certain of our older technology, and we may do so in the future.
Granting such rights may enable these companies to manufacture and market products that may be
competitive with some of our older products.

Increased costs of wafers and materials, or shortages in wafers and materials, could adversely
impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues.

If greater demand for wafers is not offset by an increase in foundry capacity, or market demand for
wafers or production and assembly materials increases, our supply of wafers and other materials
could become limited. Such shortages raise the likelihood of potential wafer price increases and
wafer shortages or shortages in materials at production and test facilities and our resulting
potential inability to address customer product demands in a timely manner. Such increases in wafer
prices or materials could adversely affect our gross margins and shortages of wafers and materials
would adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands and lead to reduced revenue.

We depend on distributors, primarily Avnet, to generate a majority of our sales and complete order
fulfillment.

Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 49% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2010, and
as of April 3, 2010, Avnet accounted for 83% of our total accounts receivable. In addition, we are
subject to concentrations of credit risk in our trade accounts receivable, which includes accounts
of our distributors. A significant reduction of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a
material change in our relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain
end customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2010, we terminated our relationship with one of our North American-based distributors. As a
result, we are increasingly dependent on our relationship with Avnet. Any adverse change to our
relationship with Avnet or our remaining distributors could have a material impact on our business.
Furthermore, if a key distributor materially defaults on a contract or otherwise fails to perform,
our business and financial results would suffer.

In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them
are important to our success. Unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial
health of some of these distributors, particularly our smaller distributors. This could result in
the insolvency of certain distributors, the inability of distributors to obtain credit to finance
the purchase of our products, or cause distributors to delay payment of their obligations to us and
increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial health of these
distributors impairs their performance and we are unable to secure alternate distributors.

We are dependent on independent subcontractors for most of our assembly and test services and
unavailability or disruption of these services could negatively impact our financial condition and
results of operations.

We are also dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly, substrate, test and
shipment services. Any prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost
attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, any disruption in assembly, test or shipment
services, or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply,
could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands.
In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and
viability of these subcontractors and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their
commitments to us. These factors would result in reduced net revenues and could negatively impact
our financial condition and results of operations.

A number of factors can impact our gross margins.

A number of factors, including yield, wafer pricing, product mix, market acceptance of our new
products, competitive pricing dynamics, geographic and/or market segment pricing strategies cause
our gross margins to fluctuate. In addition, forecasting our gross margins is difficult because the
majority of our business is based on turns within the same quarter.

Reductions in the average selling prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross
margins.

The average selling prices of our products generally decline as the products mature. We seek to
offset the decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and
increased unit sales. We also continue to develop higher value products or product features that
increase, or slow the decline of, the average selling price of our products. However, there is no
guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline
in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in revenues and have a
negative effect on our gross margins.



Because of our international business and operations, we are vulnerable to the economic conditions
of the countries in which we operate and currency fluctuations could have a material adverse affect
on our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to our U.S. operations, we also have significant international operations, including
foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, our regional
headquarters in Ireland and Singapore and a research and development site in India. In connection
with the restructuring we announced in April 2009, our international operations grew as we
relocated certain operations and administrative functions outside the U.S. Sales and operations
outside of the U.S. subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic
and regulatory environments. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business or by
changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries. We derive over one-half of
our revenues from international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Japan. Past
economic weakness in these markets adversely affected revenues. While there have been signs of
economic recovery in the U.S. and other markets, there can be no assurance that such improvement
will continue or is sustainable. Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S.
dollars. While the recent movement of the Euro and Yen against the U.S. dollar had no material
impact to our business, increased volatility could impact our European and Japanese customers.
Currency instability and volatility and disruptions in the credit and capital markets may increase
credit risks for some of our customers and may impair our customers’ ability to repay existing
obligations. Increased currency volatility could also positively or negatively impact our
foreign-currency-denominated costs, assets and liabilities. In addition, devaluation of the U.S.
dollar relative to other foreign currencies may increase the operating expenses of our foreign
subsidiaries adversely affecting our results of operations. Furthermore, because we are
increasingly dependent on the global economy, instability in worldwide economic environments
occasioned, for example, by political instability, terrorist activity or U.S. or other military
actions could adversely impact economic activity and lead to a contraction of capital spending by
our customers. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations in the future.

We are subject to the risks associated with conducting business operations outside of the U.S.
which could adversely affect our business.

In addition to international sales and support operations and development activities, we purchase
our wafers from foreign foundries and have our commercial products assembled, packaged and tested
by subcontractors located outside the U.S. All of these activities are subject to the uncertainties
associated with international business operations, including tax laws and regulations, trade
barriers, economic sanctions, import and export regulations, duties and tariffs and other trade
restrictions, changes in trade policies, foreign governmental regulations, potential vulnerability
of and reduced protection for IP, longer receivable collection periods and disruptions or delays in
production or shipments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and/or operating results. Additional factors that could adversely affect us due
to our international operations include rising oil prices and increased costs of natural resources.
Moreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of
political conflicts or economic crises in countries where our main wafer providers, end customers
and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and test services worldwide, are located. Adverse
change to the circumstances or conditions of our international business operations could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in credit rating and in the market
values of our portfolio investments which could have a material adverse impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.

Our cash, short-term and long-term investments represent significant assets that may be subject to
fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements, changes in credit
rating and financial market conditions. Since September 2007, the global credit markets have
experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the values of various types of
investment and non-investment grade securities. During this time, the global credit and capital
markets experienced significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global
financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding
sovereign financial stability.

While general conditions in the global credit markets have improved, there is a risk that we may
incur other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market
conditions deteriorate or the underlying assets fail to perform as anticipated. Our future
investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline
in fair values of our debt securities is judged to be other than temporary. Furthermore, we may
suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value
due to changes in interest rates or financial market conditions.



Our failure to protect and defend our intellectual property could impair our ability to compete
effectively.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our
intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that such intellectual property rights can be
successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, violated, circumvented or
challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted against us
patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us.
Third parties may attempt to misappropriate our IP through electronic or other means or assert
infringement claims against our indemnitees or us in the future. Such assertions by third parties
may result in costly litigation, indemnity claims or other legal actions and we may not prevail in
such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on
commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our ability to import and sell our
products. Any infringement claim, indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our
intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

We rely on information technology systems, and failure of these systems to function properly or
unauthorized access to our systems could result in business disruption.

We rely in part on various information technology (IT) systems to manage our operations, including
financial reporting, and we regularly evaluate these systems and make changes to improve them as
necessary. Consequently, we periodically implement new, or enhance existing, operational and IT
systems, procedures and controls. For example, we recently simplified our supply chain and were
required to make certain changes to our IT systems. Any delay in the implementation of, or
disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our
ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.
These systems are also subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system
failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business
disruption. We also may be subject to unauthorized access to our IT systems through a security
breach or attack. We seek to detect and investigate any security incidents and prevent their
recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.
Our business could be significantly harmed and we could be subject to third party claims in the
event of such a security breach.

Earthquakes and other natural disasters could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse
affect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California
and Singapore facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural
disasters. UMC’s foundries in Taiwan and Toshiba’s and Seiko’s foundries in Japan as well as many
of our operations in California are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the
recent past and some areas have been affected by other natural disasters such as typhoons. Any
catastrophic event in these locations will disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing
activities. This type of disruption could result in our inability to manufacture or ship products,
thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Our
insurance may not cover losses resulting from such disruptions of our operations. Additionally,
disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason, including other natural disasters such
as typhoons, volcano eruptions, fires or floods, as well as disruptions in access to adequate
supplies of electricity, natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our products, and
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, our stock price could be adversely
affected.

We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 (the Act). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with the Act may not operate
effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness disclosure. The identification of
material weaknesses in internal control, if any, could indicate a lack of proper controls to
generate accurate financial statements and could cause investors to lose confidence and our stock
price to drop.

We compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to
attract, such personnel would harm us.

We depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical
personnel. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and
attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers. Competition
for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing
qualified personnel. From time to time we have effected restructurings which eliminate a number of
positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such
terminations can have a negative impact on morale and our ability to attract and hire new qualified
personnel in the future. If we lose existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new
qualified personnel, as needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be seriously harmed.

Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and
operating results.

From time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the
ordinary conduct of our business. Certain claims are not yet resolved, including those that are
discussed under Item 3. “Legal Proceedings,” included in Part I, and additional claims may arise in
the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its
merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant
expense and diversion of management attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid
these risks. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be
resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages
or injunctive relief against us that would materially and adversely affect a portion of our
business and might materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.



Our products could have defects which could result in reduced revenues and claims against us.

We develop complex and evolving products that include both hardware and software. Despite our
testing efforts and those of our subcontractors, defects may be found in existing or new products.
These defects may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs,
divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our
relationships with customers. Subject to certain terms and conditions, we have agreed to compensate
certain customers for limited specified costs they actually incur in the event our hardware
products experience epidemic failure. As a result, epidemic failure and other performance problems
could result in claims against us, the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would
likely harm our business. Our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses.

In addition, we could be subject to product liability claims. A product liability claim brought
against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend. Product
liability risks are particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive and medical
applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of these products. Any product liability
claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the
efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business.

In preparing our financial statements, we make good faith estimates and judgments that may change
or turn out to be erroneous.

In preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the U. S., we must make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical accounting
policies. Those estimates and judgments have a significant impact on the results we report in our
consolidated financial statements. The most difficult estimates and subjective judgments that we
make concern valuation of marketable and non-marketable securities, revenue recognition,
inventories, long-lived assets, goodwill, taxes and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We also have
other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would
not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could
significantly affect our financial reporting. Actual results may differ materially from these
estimates. If these estimates or their related assumptions change, our operating results for the
periods in which we revise our estimates or assumptions could be adversely and perhaps materially
affected.

Our failure to comply with the requirements of the International Traffic and Arms Regulations could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Based on a recent jurisdictional ruling, certain Xilinx space-grade FPGAs and related technologies
are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered by the
U.S. Department of State. The ITAR governs the export and reexport of these FPGAs, the transfer of
related technical data and the provision of defense services, as well as offshore production, test
and assembly. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security
infrastructure to meet ITAR requirements.

An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when they will be granted,
increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. In addition, security or compliance program
failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent ITAR
licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have
a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or operating results.

Considerable amounts of our common shares are available for issuance under our equity incentive
plans and convertible debentures, and significant issuances in the future may adversely impact the
market price of our common shares.

As of April 3, 2010, we had 2.00 billion authorized common shares, of which 273.5 million shares
were outstanding. In addition, 54.7 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to
our equity incentive plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and 22.6 million shares were reserved
for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible debentures. The availability of
substantial amounts of our common shares resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity awards
outstanding under our equity incentive plans or the conversion or repurchase of convertible
debentures using common shares, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders, could adversely
affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise
additional capital through the sale of equity securities.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate offices, which include the administrative, sales, customer support, marketing, R&D
and manufacturing and testing groups, are located in San Jose, California. This main site consists
of adjacent buildings providing 588,000 square feet of space, which we own. Excess space in this
facility is leased to tenants under multi-year lease agreements. We also own two parcels of land
totaling approximately 121 acres in South San Jose near our corporate facility. At present, we do
not have any plans to develop the land. We also have a 106,000 square foot leased facility in San
Jose, which we do not occupy and is presently listed for subleasing.

We own a 228,000 square foot facility in the metropolitan area of Dublin, Ireland, which serves as
our regional headquarters in Europe. The Irish facility is primarily used for service and support
for our customers in Europe, R&D, marketing and IT support.

We own a 222,000 square foot facility in Singapore, which serves as our Asia Pacific regional
headquarters. We own the building but the land is subject to a 30-year lease expiring in November
2035. The Singapore facility is primarily used for manufacturing and testing of our products,
service and support for our customers in Asia Pacific/Japan, coordination and management of certain
third parties in our supply chain and R&D. Excess space in the facility is leased to tenants under
long-term lease agreements.

We own a 130,000 square foot facility in Longmont, Colorado. The Longmont facility serves as the
primary location for our software efforts in the areas of R&D, manufacturing and quality control.
In addition, we own a 200,000 square foot facility and 40 acres of land adjacent to the Longmont
facility for future expansion. The facility is partially leased to tenants under long-term lease
agreements and partially used by the Company.

offices located in the metropolitan areas of Beijing, Brussels, Helsinki, Hong Kong, London, Milan,
Munich, Osaka, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Stockholm, Taipei, Tel Aviv and Tokyo.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Internal Revenue Service

The IRS audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Company’s tax returns for fiscal 1996
through 2001. The Company filed petitions with the Tax Court in response to assertions by the IRS
relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. Except to the extent there is a further appeal by the IRS,
all issues have been settled with the IRS in this matter as described below.

On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options
must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with the
Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement, and
thus, the Company had no tax, interest, or penalties due for this issue. The Tax Court entered its
decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Appeals Court). The Company and the IRS presented oral arguments to
a three-judge panel of the Appeals Court on March 12, 2008. On May 27, 2009, the Company received
a 2-1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision and holding
that the Company should include stock option amounts in its cost sharing agreement with Xilinx
Ireland. The Company did not agree with the Appeals Court decision and filed a motion for
rehearing on August 12, 2009. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing
both the majority and dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009. On March 22, 2010, the
Appeals Court affirmed the August 30, 2005 Tax Court decision in Xilinx’s favor.

In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency
reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal 2005. The Company began negotiations with the IRS
Appeals Division on this matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. On March 22, 2010, the Company
settled the proposed adjustment related to the acquired technology with no net change in tax
liability. The Company believes it has provided adequate reserves for the remaining issues.



Patent Litigation

On November 5, 2009, Agere Systems, Inc. (Agere), a wholly-owned subsidiary of LSI Corporation
(LSI), filed an action for patent infringement and breach of contract of a patent license agreement
against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (

Agere Systems Inc. v. Xilinx,
Inc.

, Index No. 603382/09, the New York State Action). This action was ultimately removed to U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, and consolidated with the Company’s related
actions against Agere and LSI. On April 2, 2010, Xilinx and LSI reached a resolution on the
foregoing matters and all outstanding litigation between Xilinx and LSI and Agere have been
dismissed with prejudice. This resolution did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

On December 28, 2007, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG (PACT)
against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division
(PACT XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No. 2:07-CV-563). The lawsuit
pertains to eleven different patents and PACT seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages,
interest and attorneys’ fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to
the Company is estimable at this time.

Other Matters

From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the
ordinary course of our business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual
property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, tax, regulatory, distribution
arrangements, employee relations and other matters. Periodically, we review the status of each
matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal
proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, we accrue a
liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes
are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best
information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we continue to
reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year covered by this report.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

On February 25, 2008, we announced a repurchase program for up to $800.0 million of common stock.
On November 6, 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment of this repurchase program to
provide that the funds may also be used to repurchase our outstanding 3.125% junior subordinated
convertible debentures (debentures). This repurchase program has no stated expiration date. The
Company repurchased 6.2 million shares of its common stock in the open market for $150.0 million
during fiscal 2010. Through April 3, 2010, the Company had used $424.3 million of the $800.0
million authorized for the repurchase of its outstanding common stock and debentures, leaving
$375.7 million available for future purchases.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in
Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Cautionary Statement

The statements in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis that are forward looking, within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and
uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under “Risk
Factors” and elsewhere in this document. Often, forward-looking statements can be identified by
the use of forward-looking words, such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “believe,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “continue,” “plan,” “intend,” “project” and other similar terminology, or
the negative of such terms. We disclaim any responsibility to update or revise any forward-looking
statement provided in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for any reason.

Nature of Operations

We design, develop and market programmable platforms, including advanced ICs in the form of PLDs,
software design tools and predefined system functions delivered as IP cores. In addition to our
programmable platforms, we provide design services, customer training, field engineering and
technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs and CPLDs. These devices are standard products that our
customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our products are designed to provide high
integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as
wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, aerospace and defense,
audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing. We sell our products
globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to OEMs by
a network of independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management organization.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have
a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC
has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and
subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are
inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical accounting policies include:
valuation of marketable and non-marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity
securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of
revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin. Our
critical accounting policies also include: the assessment of impairment of long-lived assets, which
impacts their valuation; the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, which impacts goodwill
impairment; accounting for income taxes, which impacts the provision or benefit recognized for
income taxes, as well as the valuation of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance
sheet; and valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation, which impacts gross margin,
research and development (R&D) expenses, and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses.
Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also
have other key accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application
would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless
could significantly affect our financial reporting.

Valuation of Marketable and Non-marketable Securities

Our short-term and long-term investments include marketable debt securities and non-marketable
equity securities. As of April 3, 2010, we had marketable debt securities with a fair value of
$1.74 billion and non-marketable equity securities in private companies of $17.7 million (adjusted
cost).

We determine the fair values for marketable debt and equity securities using industry standard
pricing services, data providers and other third-party sources and by internally performing
valuation analyses. See “Note 3. Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial
statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for details of the
valuation methodologies. In determining if and when a decline in value below adjusted cost of
marketable debt and equity securities is other than temporary, we evaluate on an ongoing basis the
market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition, credit ratings, any underlying
collateral and other key measures for our investments. We assess other-than-temporary impairment
of debt and equity securities in accordance with the latest guidance issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB). We recorded an other-than-temporary impairment for marketable
debt securities and a marketable equity security in fiscal 2009. We did not record any
other-than-temporary impairment for marketable debt or equity
securities in fiscal 2010 or 2008.



Our investments in non-marketable securities of private companies are accounted for by using the
cost method. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when they are
deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In determining whether a decline in value of
non-marketable equity investments in private companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an
assessment is made by considering available evidence, including the general market conditions in
the investee’s industry, the investee’s product development status and subsequent rounds of
financing and the related valuation and/or our participation in such financings. We also assess
the investee’s ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash
and the investee’s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation. The valuation
methodology for determining the fair value of non-marketable equity securities is based on the
factors noted above which require management judgment and are Level 3 inputs. See “Note 3. Fair
Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information. When a decline in value is deemed
to be other than temporary, we recognize an impairment loss in the current period’s operating
results to the extent of the decline. We recorded other-than-temporary impairments for
non-marketable equity securities in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $3.8 million, 3.0 million and $
2.9 million, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights
of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are
deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors’ end customers. For
fiscal 2010, approximately 69% of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for
subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on
notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the distributor’s end customer.
Also reported by the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment
information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to
deferred revenue balances monthly. We maintain system controls to validate distributor data and to
verify that the reported information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors
reflects the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin expected to be
realized when distributors sell through product purchased from us. Accounts receivable from
distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers,
typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to
collection under normal payment terms.

As of April 3, 2010, we had $110.4 million of deferred revenue and $30.3 million of deferred cost
of revenues recognized as a net $80.1 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors.
As of March 28, 2009, we had $90.4 million of deferred revenue and $28.0 million of deferred cost
of revenues recognized as a net $62.4 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors.
The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our
consolidated statement of income will be different than the amount shown on the consolidated
balance sheet due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors when the product is sold
to their end customers.

Revenue from sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive
evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of
resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance requirements and
no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there were no significant
formal acceptance provisions with our direct customers.

Revenue from software licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses
of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed. Revenue
from Support Products, which includes software and services sales, was less than 6% of net revenues
for all of the periods presented.

Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known
pending customer returns or allowances.

Valuation of Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out
method) or market (estimated net realizable value). The valuation of inventory requires us to
estimate excess or obsolete inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We
review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. Our
manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of
actual spending over actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the cyclicality of the
market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, we write down inventory based on
forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and
economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic
direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future
demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts,
which are also consistent with our short-term manufacturing plans. If our demand forecast for
specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output
accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative
impact on our gross margin.



Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential
impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When indicators of
impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows
attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to
recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair
values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on
appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the
specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.

When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the
excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Factors affecting impairment of
assets held for sale include market conditions. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate
impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.

Long-lived assets such as goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are
considered non-financial assets, and are only measured at fair value when indicators of impairment
exist. The accounting and disclosure guidance for fair value measurements established by the FASB
became effective for these assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. See “Note 3. Fair
Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information.

Goodwill

As
required by the authoritative guidance for goodwill established by the FASB, goodwill is not amortized but is
subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of potential
impairment exist, and goodwill is written down when it is determined to be impaired. We perform an
annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and compare the fair value of
the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying value
exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired. For purposes
of impairment testing, Xilinx operates as a single reporting unit. We use the quoted market price
method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on the impairment review performed
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2010.
Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for goodwill will be
performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. To date, no impairment indicators
have been identified.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Xilinx is a multinational corporation operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. We must determine
the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions and
apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. We undergo routine audits by taxing
authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among
various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often require an extended period of time to resolve and may
result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions
with different tax rates.

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and
judgments. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and
in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from
temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.
Additionally, we must estimate the amount and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or
deficiency notices issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities’ positions and our
assessment can change over time resulting in a material effect on the provision for income taxes in
periods when these changes occur.

We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If
recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve in the form
of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be
recoverable.

We perform a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions relating to
accounting for income taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the
position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation
processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is
more than 50% likely of being ultimately realized. See “Note 16. Income Taxes” to our consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”



Stock-Based Compensation

Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards
at the date of grant requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate
the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our Employee Stock
Purchase Plan. Option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model, also require the use of
input assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected dividend
rate, expected forfeiture rate and expected risk-free rate of return. We use implied volatility
based on traded options in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of
market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In
determining the appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered: the volume of market activity
of traded options, and determined there was sufficient market activity; the ability to reasonably
match the input variables of traded options to those of options granted by us, such as date of
grant and the exercise price, and determined the input assumptions were comparable; and the length
of term of traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally one to two years
and which was extrapolated to match the expected term of the employee options granted by us, and
determined the length of the option term was reasonable. The expected life of options granted is
based on the historical exercise activity as well as the expected disposition of all options
outstanding. We will continue to review our input assumptions and make changes as deemed
appropriate depending on new information that becomes available. Higher volatility and expected
lives result in a proportional increase to stock-based compensation determined at the date of
grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return do not have as significant
an effect on the calculation of fair value.

In addition, we developed an estimate of the number of stock-based awards which will be forfeited
due to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate have an effect on
reported stock-based compensation, as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization
after April 1, 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual
forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to
increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized
in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture
rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an
increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. The impact of forfeiture true up
and forfeiture rate estimates in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 reduced stock-based compensation
expense by $16.7 million, $15.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively. The expense we recognize
in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and/or our forecasts due
to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates.

Net revenues in fiscal 2010 were essentially flat with fiscal 2009. Revenues in the last two
quarters of fiscal 2010 were substantially higher than revenues in the first two quarters of the
year. The first two quarters of fiscal 2010 were adversely impacted by economic conditions, and
were also substantially lower than the same periods of the prior fiscal year. New Product
revenues increased considerably in fiscal 2010 but were offset by the declines in Mainstream, Base
and Support products. The 1% decline in net revenues in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was
largely due to the recessionary environment we experienced during the fiscal year which impacted
our sales across a broad base of end markets. In fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, total unit sales
declined and average selling price per unit increased compared to the comparable prior year
periods. See “Net Revenues by Product” and “Net Revenues by End Markets” below for more
information on our product and end-market categories.

No end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented.

Net Revenues by Product

We sell our products to global manufacturers of electronic products in end markets such as wired
and wireless communications, aerospace and defense, industrial, scientific and medical and audio,
video and broadcast. The vast majority of our net revenues are generated by sales of our
semiconductor products, but we also generate sales from support products. We classify our product
offerings into four categories: New, Mainstream, Base and Support Products. The composition of
each product category is as follows:

•

New Products include our most recent product offerings and include the
Virtex

®

-6, Virtex-5, Spartan

®

-6, Spartan-3A and Spartan-3E product
families.

•

Mainstream Products include the Virtex-4, Spartan-3, Spartan-II and CoolRunner™-II
product families.

•

Base Products consist of our older product families including the Virtex, Virtex-E,
Virtex-II, Spartan, XC4000, CoolRunner and XC9500 products.

•

Support Products include configuration products (PROMs), software, IP cores, customer
training, design services and support.

These product categories, except for Support Products, are modified on a periodic basis to better
reflect the age of the products and advances in technology. The most recent modification was made
on March 29, 2009, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2010. Amounts for the prior periods
presented have been reclassified to conform to the new categorization. New Products include our
most recent product offerings and are typically designed into our customers’ latest generation of
electronic systems. Mainstream Products are generally several years old and designed into customer
programs that are currently shipping in full production. Base Products are older than Mainstream
Products with demand generated generally by the oldest customer systems still in production.
Support Products are generally products or services sold in conjunction with our semiconductor
devices to aid customers in the design process.

Net revenues from New Products increased significantly in fiscal 2010 due to continued strong
market acceptance of these products, particularly our 65-nm Virtex-5 product family. Sales from
Virtex-5 nearly doubled in fiscal 2010. In addition, design win activity is strong for our next
generation product families which include our high-end, 40-nm Virtex-6 field programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs) and our high-volume, 45-nm Spartan-6 FPGAs. We expect these New Product families to
contribute significantly to the growth in New Product revenues over time. In fiscal 2009, Virtex-5
and Spartan-3E contributed to the majority of the revenue growth versus the comparable prior year
period.

Net revenues from Mainstream Products declined in fiscal 2010 due to lower demand associated with
the weakened economic conditions during the first half of the fiscal year. Net revenues from
Mainstream Products increased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased sales of our Virtex-4
product family.

The decline in net revenues from Base Products in fiscal 2010 and 2009 was expected since these
products are mature and approaching the end of life.

Net revenues from Support Products decreased in fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period
due to a decline in revenues from both our PROMs and software products. Net revenues from Support
Products decreased in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to a decline
in sales from our PROM products.



Net Revenues by End Markets

Our end market revenue data is derived from our understanding of our end customers’ primary
markets. We classify our net revenues by end markets into four categories: Communications,
Industrial and Other, Consumer and Automotive, and Data Processing. The percentage change
calculation in the table below represents the year-to-year dollar change in each end market.

Net revenues from Communications, our largest end market, increased in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009
from the comparable prior year periods due to higher sales from wireless communication
applications.

In fiscal 2010, the decrease in net revenues from the Industrial and Other end market from the
comparable prior year period was primarily driven by weaker sales in industrial, scientific and
medical applications as well as test and measurement applications during the first half of the
fiscal year. Net revenues from the Industrial and Other end market increased slightly in fiscal
2009 compared with the prior year period due to strong sales growth from aerospace and defense and
industrial, scientific and medical applications. However, this growth was offset considerably by
weakness in test and measurement applications.

Net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market decreased in fiscal 2010 from the
comparable prior year period primarily due to decreased sales in audio, video and broadcast and
consumer applications. Net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market decreased in
fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period due to weaker sales from audio, video and
broadcast and automotive applications, which were partially offset by an increase in sales from
consumer applications.

In fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, net revenues from the Data Processing end market declined from the
comparable prior year periods due to decreases in sales from computing and data processing
applications.

Net revenues in North America were essentially flat in fiscal 2010 compared with the prior year
period. Lower sales from the Consumer and Automotive end market offset strength in each of the
other end markets including Communications, Industrial and Other and Data Processing. Net revenues
in North America decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower sales from the Communications end
market.

Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. The increases were driven by
strength in the Communications end market, primarily from the deployment of next generation
wireless applications in China.

Net revenues in Europe decreased in fiscal 2010 due to weaker sales in most end market applications
with the exception of wireless communication and automotive applications. Net revenues in Europe
increased in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period primarily due to strength in wireless
communication applications.

Net revenues in Japan decreased in fiscal 2010 due to broad-based weakness across all end market
categories. The fiscal 2009 decline was due to broad-based weakness across most end market
categories with the exception of the Consumer and Automotive end market.

Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2010 was essentially flat from the comparable prior year period
as cost savings related to yield improvement and overall restructuring effort were offset by the
strength of New Products. New Products generally have lower gross margins than Mainstream and Base
Products as they are in the early stage of their product life cycle and have higher unit costs
associated with relatively lower volumes and early manufacturing maturity.

The increase in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period
was driven primarily by product cost reductions, higher average selling prices per unit and
improved operational efficiency.

Gross margin may be affected in the future by product mix shifts, competitive-pricing pressure,
manufacturing-yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate any adverse impacts from these
factors by continuing to improve yields on our New Products and by improving manufacturing
efficiencies.

Sales
of inventory previously written off were not material during fiscal
2010, 2009 or 2008.

In order to compete effectively, we pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the
form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is
common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing
process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost. We have historically been able to
offset much of this revenue decline in our mature products with increased revenues from newer
products.

R&D spending increased $14.1 million or 4% during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period last
year. The increase was mainly due to increased mask and wafer spending in fiscal 2010 associated
with the introduction of the Virtex 6 and Spartan 6 product families.

R&D spending decreased $2.7 million or 1% during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease
was attributable to lower mask and wafer spending and reduced stock-based compensation expense,
which was partially offset by increased outside services to support our investments in new product
development.

We plan to continue to selectively invest in R&D efforts in areas such as new products and more
advanced process development, IP cores and the development of new design and layout software. We
will also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for technology leadership and
engineering resources in critical areas.

SG&A expenses decreased $16.2 million or 5% during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period last

taken during fiscal 2010, partially offset by higher litigation related expenses (see Note 18 to
our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data).”

SG&A expenses decreased $21.5 million or 6% during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The
decrease was primarily due to headcount reduction as a result of a functional reorganization
announced during fiscal 2009, lower sales commissions and lower stock-based compensation expense,
which was partially offset by higher litigation costs.

Restructuring Charges

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we announced restructuring measures designed to drive
structural operating efficiencies across the Company. We completed this restructuring plan by the
end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and reduced our global workforce by approximately 200
positions, or about 6%. These employee terminations impacted various geographies and functions
worldwide. We recorded total restructuring charges of $30.1 million in fiscal 2010, primarily
related to severance costs and benefits expenses.

These fiscal 2010 charges above, as well as fiscal 2009 charges included in the table below, have
been shown separately as restructuring charges on the consolidated statements of income. The
remaining accrual as of April 3, 2010 primarily relates to severance costs and benefits that are
expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2011.

We estimate that severance costs and benefits expenses incurred in the fiscal 2010 restructuring
will result in gross annual cash savings relating to employee compensation of approximately $23.0
million before taxes. We began realizing cash savings associated with the restructuring, primarily
within the SG&A and R&D expense categories, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, but we
do not expect to fully realize the cash savings benefit until fiscal 2011. There can be no
assurance that these expected future savings will be completely realized as they may be partially
offset by increases in other expenses. In addition, we estimate cumulative stock-based compensation
expense savings of approximately $6.6 million through fiscal 2013 as a result of the fiscal 2010
restructuring. The vast majority of the stock-based compensation expense savings already occurred
in fiscal 2010. Future stock-based compensation expense may increase depending on other factors,
primarily the number of shares to be granted, fair value of the future stock awards under equity
incentive plans (which are primarily impacted by our then market price of the common stock and
stock price volatility) and the impact of future award forfeitures.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we announced a functional reorganization pursuant to which
we eliminated 249 positions, or approximately 7% of our global workforce. These employee
terminations occurred across various geographies and functions worldwide. The reorganization plan
was completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

We recorded total restructuring charges of $22.0 million in connection with the reorganization in
fiscal 2009. These charges consisted of $20.5 million of
severance costs and benefits expenses and
$1.5 million of facility-related costs.

The
$2.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense for
fiscal 2010 as compared to the same period last year was due to an
increase in the number of shares granted, which was partly offset by declining weighted-average
fair values of stock awards vesting and an increase in the number of shares cancelled due to the
fiscal 2010 restructuring. The $11.9 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense for
fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period last year was due to a decrease in the number of shares granted, declining weighted-average fair
values of stock awards vesting and an increase in the number of shares cancelled due to the fiscal
2009 restructuring.

Gain on Early Extinguishment of Convertible Debentures

During fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million in cash to repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount)
of our debentures and recognized a gain on early extinguishment of convertible debentures of $75.0
million, net of the write-off of the pro rata portions of unamortized debt discount and issuance
costs of $41.5 million and unamortized derivative valuation of $736 thousand. Accrued interest paid
at the time of repurchases totaled $2.4 million.

Beginning in fiscal 2010, we retrospectively adopted the authoritative guidance for convertible
debentures issued by the FASB. The authoritative guidance specifies that issuers of convertible
debt instruments should separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option)
components of such instruments in a manner that reflects the borrowing rate for a similar
non-convertible debt. See “Adoption of New Accounting Standard for Convertible Debentures”
included in “Note 2. Basis of Presentation” to our consolidated financial statements, included in
Part 1. “Financial Information,” for further information relating to the adoption.

We recorded an impairment loss on investments in non-marketable equity securities of $3.8 million
and $2.9 million for fiscal 2010 and 2008, respectively, due to the weak financial condition of
certain investees. We recognized impairment losses on investments of $54.1 million during fiscal
2009, which consisted of $51.1 million impairment losses related to marketable debt and equity
securities and $3.0 million impairment losses in non-marketable equity securities.

Of the $54.1 million impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2009, $38.0 million was related to
senior class asset-backed securities where the issuer went into receivership. The receiver
subsequently sought judicial interpretation of a provision of a legal document governing the
issuer’s securities. As a result of the outcome of the judicial determination, the receiver
immediately liquidated the substantial majority of the issuer’s assets, and in accordance with the
court order, the proceeds were used to repay short-term liabilities in the order in which they fell
due. In December 2008, the receiver reported to the issuer’s creditors the outcome of the judicial
determination and that the issuer’s liabilities substantially exceeded its assets. As a result, the
receiver estimated that the issuer would not be able to pay any liabilities falling due after
October 2008 regardless of the seniority or status of the securities. Based on these developments,
we concluded that it was not likely that we would recover the balance of our investment. This
decline in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary and, therefore, we recognized an
impairment loss of $38.0 million on these securities during fiscal 2009. In October 2009, a higher
court reversed the initial judicial interpretation and determined that the proceeds should be used
to repay short-term liabilities on a pari passu basis. Given the significant liabilities of the
issuer, it is uncertain whether we will recover any of our original investment. We have not
recognized any amount that may be due back to us.

We also recognized an additional impairment loss of $10.0 million on marketable debt securities in
our investment portfolio during fiscal 2009, $9.0 million of which was due to the bankruptcy filing
by one of the issuers of the marketable debt securities.

In addition to the aforementioned amounts, we recorded $3.1 million of impairment loss in
marketable equity securities investment during fiscal 2009 as a result of the continued decline in
its market value, which led us to believe that the decline in the market value was other than
temporary. Furthermore, during the same period, we recorded $3.0 million of write down of our
investment in non-marketable equity securities in private companies, which was recorded due
primarily to the weak financial condition of certain investees.

The decrease in interest and other income (expense), net in fiscal 2010 over the prior year was due
primarily to a decrease in interest rates earned on the investment portfolio. The average interest
rate yield on our investments decreased by over 2.5 percentage points year-over-year. The decrease
in interest and other income (expense), net in fiscal 2009 over the prior year was due primarily to
a decrease in interest rates and a smaller investment portfolio. The average interest rate yield
on our investments decreased by approximately 2.0 percentage points year-over-year. Interest
expense also decreased in fiscal 2009 and further in 2010 due to the fact that we repurchased our
debentures in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. See “Note 12. Interest and Other Income
(Expense), Net” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements

The effective tax rates in all years reflected the favorable impact of foreign income at statutory
rates less than the U.S. rate and tax credits earned.

The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010, when compared with fiscal 2009, was due to
an increase in the amount permanently reinvested outside the U. S. in fiscal 2010 for which no U.S.
taxes have been provided, thereby reducing the rates for the period, compounded by an increase in
the fiscal 2009 rate for the gain on early extinguishment of debentures taxable at U.S. tax rates.
The effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was flat when compared with fiscal 2008, as the recognized
gain on the early extinguishment of debentures was offset by the benefit of retroactive extension
of the research credit in fiscal 2009.

The IRS examined our tax returns for fiscal 1996 through 2001. Except to the extent there is a
further appeal by the IRS, all issues have been settled with the IRS in this matter as described
below.

On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options
must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with us
that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement. Accordingly,
there were no additional taxes, penalties or interest due for this issue. The Tax Court entered
its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the Appeals
Court. On May 27, 2009, we received a 2-1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing
the Tax Court decision and holding that we should include stock option amounts in our cost sharing
agreement with Xilinx Ireland. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing
both the majority and dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009. On March 22, 2010, the
Appeals Court, in a 2-1 majority opinion, affirmed the Tax Court decision in Xilinx’s favor.

In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency
reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal 2005. We began negotiations with the IRS Appeals
Division on this matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. On March 22, 2010, we settled the
proposed adjustment related to acquired technology with no net change in tax liability. See Item 3.
“Legal Proceedings” included in Part I and “Note 16. Income Taxes” and “Note 18. Litigation
Settlements and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8.
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing
to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary
technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock and debentures
under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our
investments in debt securities are available for future sale.



Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and Long-term Investments

The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of April 3,
2010 and March 28, 2009 totaled $1.97 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. As of April 3,
2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.39 billion and working capital
of $1.55 billion. Cash provided by operations of $554.3 million for fiscal 2010 was $111.8 million
higher than the $442.5 million generated during fiscal 2009. Cash provided by operations during
fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items, increases in
accrued liabilities, accounts payable and deferred income on shipment to distributors, which were
partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, other assets, inventories and prepaid and
other current assets as well as a decrease in income taxes payable.

Net cash used in investing activities was $336.7 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to net
cash provided by investing activities of $274.5 million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in investing
activities during fiscal 2010 consisted of $306.3 million of net purchases of available-for-sale
securities and $28.2 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further discussion
below) and $2.3 million of other investing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities was $252.1 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $518.1
million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 consisted of
$150.0 million for the repurchase of common stock, $165.6 million for dividend payments to
stockholders and $1.3 million for reduction of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. These
items were partially offset by $64.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under
employee stock plans.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor
pricing adjustments increased by 21% from $216.4 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to $262.7
million at the end of fiscal 2010. Days sales outstanding increased to 53 days as of April 3, 2010
from 43 days as of March 28, 2009. The increases were primarily attributable to increase in net
shipments at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the end of the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2009.

Inventories

Inventories increased from $119.8 million as of March 28, 2009 to $130.6 million as of April 3,
2010. The combined inventory days at Xilinx and the distribution channel increased to 89 days as
of April 3, 2010, compared to 80 days as of March 28, 2009. The increases were primarily due to
higher inventory at Xilinx and in the distributor channel as a result of the higher anticipated
demand.

We attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product, package and speed
configurations in order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand.
Conversely, we also attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher
inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with
architecture and manufacturing process advancements. We continually strive to balance these two
objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost.

Property, Plant and Equipment

During fiscal 2010, we invested $28.2 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $39.1
million in fiscal 2009. Primary investments in fiscal 2010 were for software, testers, handlers,
computer and other equipment. Property, plant and equipment expenditures could increase in the
near future due to investment in infrastructure and manufacturing related equipment.

Current Liabilities

Current liabilities increased from $233.1 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to $357.2 million at
the end of fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to the increase in trade payables and
accrued liabilities from variable spending driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2010 compared to the same prior year period, and an increase in deferred income on shipments
to distributors. The increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to an
increase in distributor inventories as of April 3, 2010 compared to the prior year.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stockholders’ equity increased $171.7 million during fiscal 2010, from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2009
to $2.12 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase in stockholders’ equity was attributable to total
comprehensive income of $375.1 million (which included net income of $357.5 million) for fiscal
2010, the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $60.1 million and stock-based
compensation related amounts totaling $52.1 million (net of the related tax benefits associated
with stock option exercises). The increases were partially offset by the payment of dividends to
stockholders of $165.6 million and the repurchase of common stock of $150.0 million.



Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and Long-term Investments

The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of March 28,
2009 and March 29, 2008 totaled $1.67 billion and $1.86 billion, respectively. As of March 28,
2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.32 billion and working capital
of $1.52 billion. Cash provided by operations of $442.5 million for fiscal 2009 was $138.5 million
lower than the $581.0 million generated during fiscal 2008. Cash provided by operations during
fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items, an increase
in deferred income taxes and a decrease in accounts receivable, which were partially offset by
decreases in accrued liabilities and deferred income on shipments to distributors.

Net cash provided by investing activities was $274.5 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to
$192.0 million in fiscal 2008. Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009
consisted of $314.4 million of net proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale
securities. These items were partially offset by $39.1 million for purchases of property, plant
and equipment (see further discussion below) and $793 thousand of other investing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities was $518.1 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to $541.9
million in fiscal 2008. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 consisted of
$193.2 million for the repurchase of debentures, $275.0 million for the repurchase of common stock
and $154.5 million for dividend payments to stockholders. These items were partially offset by
$99.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $4.8
million for excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor
pricing adjustments decreased 13% from $249.1 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to $216.4 million
at the end of fiscal 2009. Days sales outstanding decreased to 43 days as of March 28, 2009 from
49 days as of March 29, 2008. The decreases were primarily attributable to a decrease in net
shipments and weaker linearity of shipments at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009
compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

Inventories

Inventories decreased from $130.3 million as of March 29, 2008 to $119.8 million as of March 28,
2009. The combined inventory days at Xilinx and the distribution channel decreased to 80 days as
of March 28, 2009, compared to 94 days as of March 29, 2008. The decreases were primarily due to
lower inventory at Xilinx and in the distributor channel as a result of declining revenues due to
lower anticipated demand and more effective inventory management processes.

Property, Plant and Equipment

During fiscal 2009, we invested $39.1 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $45.6
million in fiscal 2008. Primary investments in fiscal 2009 were for building improvements, test
equipment, computer equipment and software.

Current Liabilities

Current liabilities decreased from $340.7 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to $233.1 million at
the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the decreases in income taxes payable
and deferred income on shipments to distributors. The decrease in deferred income on shipments to
distributors was due to a decrease in distributor inventories as of March 28, 2009 compared to the
prior year.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stockholders’ equity decreased $20.4 million during fiscal 2009, from $1.97 billion in fiscal 2008
to $1.95 billion in fiscal 2009. The decrease in stockholders’ equity was attributable to the
repurchase of common stock of $275.0 million, the payment of dividends to stockholders of $154.5
million, an early extinguishment of convertible debentures of $72.6 million, an adjustment to the
cumulative effect of adopting FASB authoritative guidance for measuring uncertain tax positions of
$10.1 million, unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, net of deferred tax benefits, of
$14.9 million, cumulative translation adjustment of $7.7 million and unrealized hedging transaction
losses totaling $2.0 million. The decreases were partially offset by net income of $361.7 million
for fiscal 2009, the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $96.4 million,
stock-based compensation related amounts totaling $54.1 million and the related tax benefits
associated with stock option exercises and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $4.2 million.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources.
Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $250.0 million
revolving credit facility entered into in April 2007. We are not aware of any lack of access to
the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the credit
facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our credit facility
is not reliant upon a single bank. There have been no borrowings to date under our existing
revolving credit facility. We also have a shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant to
which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt, equity and other securities in the future to
augment our liquidity and capital resources.

We used $150.0 million of cash to repurchase 6.2 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2010
compared with $275.0 million used to repurchase 10.8 million shares in fiscal 2009. In addition,
during fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million of cash to repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount)
of our debentures resulting in a net gain on early extinguishment of debentures of $75.0 million.
During fiscal 2010, we paid $165.6 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing an
aggregate amount of $0.60 per common share. During fiscal 2009, we paid $154.5 million in cash
dividends to stockholders, representing an aggregate amount of $0.56 per common share. In
addition, on April 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per common
share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The dividend is payable on June 9, 2010 to
stockholders of record on May 19, 2010. Our common stock and debentures repurchase program and
dividend policy could be impacted by, among other items, our views on potential future capital
requirements relating to R&D, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, principal and interest
payments on our debentures and other strategic investments.

The global credit crisis has imposed exceptional levels of volatility and disruption in the capital
markets, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, and increased counterparty risk.
Nevertheless, we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will
be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We will continue to evaluate
opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, procurement of additional
capital equipment and facilities, development of new products, and potential acquisitions of
technologies or businesses that could complement our business. However, the risk factors discussed
in Item 1A included in Part I and below could affect our cash positions adversely. In addition,
certain types of investments such as auction rate securities may present risks arising from
liquidity and/or credit concerns. In the event that our investments in auction rate securities
become illiquid, we do not expect this will materially affect our liquidity and capital resources
or results of operations.

As of April 3, 2010, marketable securities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs were
comprised of $61.6 million of student loan auction rate securities. The amount of assets and
liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as a percentage of the total
assets and liabilities measured at fair value was less than 4% as of April 3, 2010. See “Note 3.
Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information.

During fiscal 2010, we sold $20.0 million notional value of senior class asset-backed securities
and realized a $1.0 million loss. Additionally, during fiscal 2010, $20.0 million notional value of
senior class asset-backed securities that were measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs matured
at par value.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of April 3, 2010 and the
effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
This table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current
liabilities as of April 3, 2010.

We lease some of our facilities, office buildings and land under non-cancelable operating
leases that expire at various dates through November 2035. Rent expense, net of rental
income, under all operating leases was approximately $5.3 million for fiscal 2010. See “Note
10. Commitments” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information about operating leases.



(2)

Due to the nature of our business, we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture
our silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The lengthy subcontractor
lead times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to
pay for the materials and services when completed. We expect to receive and pay for these
materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and
quality specifications.

(3)

As of April 3, 2010, we had $10.0 million of non-cancelable license obligations to
providers of electronic design automation software and hardware/software maintenance expiring
at various dates through September 2011.

(4)

We committed up to $5.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to intellectual property
until July 2023. License payments will be amortized over the useful life of the intellectual
property acquired.

(5)

In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00 billion principal amount of debentures due March
15, 2037. As a result of the repurchases in fiscal 2009, the remaining outstanding principal
amount of the debentures as of April 3, 2010 was $689.6 million. The debentures require
payment of interest at an annual rate of 3.125% payable semiannually on March 15 and September
15 of each year, beginning September 15, 2007. For purposes of this table we have assumed the
principal of our debentures will be paid on March 15, 2037. See “Note 14. Convertible
Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility” to our consolidated financial statements, included
in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information about our
debentures.

As of April 3, 2010, $56.2 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest
and penalties were classified as long-term income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet.
Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of April 3, 2010, we are unable to reliably estimate
the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, liabilities for
uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

As of April 3, 2010, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in
Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk” to our
consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data,” for information about recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of
adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of
fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $1.74 billion as of April 3, 2010. Our
primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal
and meeting liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio includes municipal bonds, floating rate
notes, mortgage-backed securities, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds,
student loan auction rate securities and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. In
accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and
limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer’s credit rating. These
securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates
increase. A hypothetical 100 basis-point (one percentage point) increase or decrease in interest
rates compared to rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the fair value of
our investment portfolio by less than $10.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively.

Credit Market Risk

Since September 2007, the global credit markets have experienced adverse conditions that have
negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities.
During this time, the global credit and capital markets experienced significant volatility and
disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global
economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. While general conditions
in the global credit markets have improved, there is a risk that we may incur additional
other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market
conditions deteriorate. See “Note 4. Financial Instruments” to our consolidated financial
statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional
information about our investments.



Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated
transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained and the hedged relationship has been
effective, are deferred and included in income or expenses in the same period that the underlying
transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are
recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred.

We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas operating expenses and
other liabilities when deemed appropriate. As of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009, we had the
following outstanding forward currency exchange contracts:

April 3,

British Pound

4,889

6,408

$

96,767

$

100,166

As part of our strategy to reduce volatility of operating expenses due to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations, we employ a hedging program with a five-quarter forward outlook for major
foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses. The outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts expire at various dates between April 2010 and April 2011. The net unrealized gain or
loss, which approximates the fair market value of the above contracts, was immaterial as of April
3, 2010 and March 28, 2009.

Our investments in several of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than
the U.S. dollar. As the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated at each quarter
end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S.
dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments. These fluctuations are recorded within
stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Other
monetary foreign-denominated assets and liabilities are revalued on a monthly basis with gains and
losses on revaluation reflected in net income. A hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change
in foreign currency exchange rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have affected the
annualized foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by less than
$8.0 million for each year. In addition, a hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in
foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 would have
affected the value of foreign-currency-denominated cash and investments by less than $6.0 million
as of each date.

XILINX, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Nature of Operations

Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company) designs, develops and markets programmable platforms,
including advanced integrated circuits, software design tools and predefined system functions
delivered as intellectual property cores. In addition to its programmable platforms, the Company
provides design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. The wafers
used to manufacture its products are obtained primarily from independent wafer manufacturers
located in Taiwan and Japan. The Company is dependent on these foundries to produce and deliver
silicon wafers on a timely basis. The Company is also dependent on subcontractors, primarily
located in the Asia Pacific region, to provide semiconductor assembly, test and shipment services.
Xilinx is a global company with sales offices throughout the world. The Company derives over
one-half of its revenues from international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and
Japan.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xilinx and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany transactions. The Company uses a
52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2010 was a 53-week year
ended on April 3, 2010. Each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 was a 52-week year, ended on March 28, 2009
and March 29, 2008, respectively. Fiscal 2011 will be a 52-week year ending on April 2, 2011.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard for Convertible Debentures

Beginning in fiscal 2010, the Company retrospectively adopted the authoritative guidance for
convertible debentures issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which affected
the Company’s 3.125% junior subordinated convertible debentures (debentures). The guidance
specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments should separately account for the liability
(debt) and equity (conversion option) components of such instruments in a manner that reflects the
borrowing rate for a similar non-convertible debt. The liability component is recognized at fair
value, based on the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature at
issuance. The equity component is based on the excess of the principal amount of the debentures
over the fair value of the liability component, after adjusting for an allocation of debt issuance
costs and the deferred tax impact. Such excess represents the estimated fair value of the
conversion feature and is recorded as additional paid-in capital. The Company’s debentures were
issued at a coupon rate of 3.125%, which was below the rate of a similar instrument that did not
have a conversion feature at that time (7.20%). Therefore, the valuation of the debt component
resulted in a discounted carrying value of the debentures compared to the principal. This debt
discount is amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the expected life of the debt,
which is also the stated life of the debt. The consolidated financial statements have been
retrospectively adjusted for all periods presented in accordance with the authoritative guidance
for convertible debentures. See “Note 10. Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility”
for further information.

The effect of the retrospective adoption on individual line items on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet was as follows:

convertible debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and the repurchase of a portion of
the debentures.

(2)

Other assets as of March 28, 2009 decreased by $13.6 million due to a decrease to long-term
deferred tax assets of $7.0 million and a retroactive adjustment of debt issuance costs from
other assets to additional paid-in capital of $6.6 million upon the adoption of the accounting
standard for convertible debentures. The reclassification resulted in a cumulative decrease in
amortization of debt issuance costs of $488 thousand as of March 28, 2009.

Gain on early extinguishment of convertible debentures decreased due to the allocation of the
original gain to additional paid-in capital.

(2)

Interest and other income (expense), net decreased due to additional interest expense recorded
retroactively, partially offset by a reduction of amortization of debt issuance costs.

For fiscal 2010, the retrospective adoption increased interest expense by $3.7 million and
decreased provision for income taxes by $1.4 million, and thereby reducing net income by $2.3
million (or $0.01 of net income per basic and diluted common share).

The retrospective adoption does not change the Company’s net cash provided by (used in) operating,
investing or financing activities for any periods.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Such estimates relate to, among others, the useful lives of assets, assessment of
recoverability of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, inventory
write-downs, allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, stock-based compensation,
potential reserves relating to litigation and tax matters, valuation of certain investments and
derivative financial instruments as well as other accruals or reserves. Actual results may differ
from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities from the date of
purchase of three months or less. These investments consist of commercial paper, bank certificates
of deposit, money market funds and time deposits. Short-term investments consist of municipal
bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities,
floating rate notes, mortgage-backed securities and bank certificates of deposit with original
maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year from the balance
sheet date. Long-term investments consist of U.S. and foreign government and agency securities,
corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, floating rate notes and municipal bonds with remaining
maturities greater than one year, unless the investments are specifically identified to fund
current operations, in which case they are classified as short-term investments. As of April 3,
2010 and March 28, 2009, long-term investments also included approximately $61.6 million and $58.4
million, respectively, of auction rate securities that experienced failed auctions in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2008. These auction rate securities are secured primarily by pools of student
loans originated under Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) that are substantially
guaranteed by the U. S. Department of Education. Equity investments are also classified as
long-term investments since they are not intended to fund current operations.

The Company maintains its cash balances with various banks with high quality ratings, and
investment banking and asset management institutions. The Company manages its liquidity risk by
investing in a variety of money market funds, high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds,
municipal bonds and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. This diversification of
investments is consistent with its policy to maintain liquidity and ensure the ability to collect
principal. The Company maintains an offshore investment portfolio denominated in U.S. dollars.
All investments are made pursuant to corporate investment policy guidelines. Investments include
Euro commercial paper, Euro dollar bonds, Euro dollar floating rate notes, offshore time deposits,
U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S.
government-sponsored enterprises and agencies.



Management classifies investments as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase
and re-evaluates such designation at each balance sheet date, although classification is not
generally changed. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive
intent and the ability to hold the securities until maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are
carried at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such
amortization, as well as any interest on the securities, is included in interest income. No
investments were classified as held-to-maturity as of April 3, 2010 or March 28, 2009.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses, net of
tax, included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’
equity. See “Note 3. Fair Value Measurements” for information relating to the determination of
fair value. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in interest
and other income (expense), net, and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are
included in impairment loss on investments. The cost of securities matured or sold is based on the
specific identification method.

In determining whether a decline in value of non-marketable equity investments in private companies
is other than temporary, the assessment is made by considering available evidence including the
general market conditions in the investee’s industry, the investee’s product development status,
the investee’s ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash
and the investee’s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation. When a decline in
value is deemed to be other than temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the
current period’s operating results to the extent of the decline.

Accounts Receivable

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company’s best estimate of probable losses
inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on the
aging of Xilinx’s accounts receivable, historical experience, known troubled accounts, management
judgment and other currently available evidence. Xilinx writes off accounts receivable against the
allowance when Xilinx determines a balance is uncollectible and no longer actively pursues
collection of the receivable. The amounts of accounts receivable written off were insignificant for
all periods presented.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out
method), or market (estimated net realizable value) and are comprised of the following:

The Company reviews and sets standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing
costs. The Company’s manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming
full absorption of actual spending over actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the
cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, the Company
writes down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are
impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and
changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual
demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on
recorded inventory values.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
for financial reporting purposes is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets of three to five years for machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures
and 15 to 30 years for buildings. Depreciation expense totaled $50.2 million, $55.6 million and
$54.2 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment if
indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis.
When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future
undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected
to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their
estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets
or based on appraisals. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, Xilinx
estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair
value.



Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently
if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. All other
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment.
Based on the impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, there was no
impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2010. Unless there are indicators of impairment, the Company’s
next impairment review for goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2011. To date, no impairment indicators have been identified.

Revenue Recognition

Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights
of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are
deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors’ end customers. For
fiscal 2010, approximately 69% of the Company’s net revenues were from products sold to
distributors for subsequent resale to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or their subcontract
manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has
been sold to the distributor’s end customer. Also reported by the distributor are product resale
price, quantity and end customer shipment information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported
distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. The Company
maintains system controls to validate distributor data and to verify that the reported information
is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor
price adjustments and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized when distributors sell
through product purchased from the Company. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized
and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from Xilinx
at which point the Company has a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment
terms.

As of April 3, 2010, the Company had $110.4 million of deferred revenue and $30.3 million of
deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $80.1 million of deferred income on shipments to
distributors. As of March 28, 2009, the Company had $90.4 million of deferred revenue and $28.0
million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $62.4 million of deferred income on
shipments to distributors. The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately
be recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of income will be different than the amount
shown on the consolidated balance sheet due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors
when the product is sold to their end customers.

Revenue from sales to the Company’s direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that
persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred,
collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance
requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there
were no significant formal acceptance provisions with the Company’s direct customers.

Revenue from software licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses
of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed. Revenue
from Support Products, which includes software and services sales, was less than 6% of net revenues
for all of the periods presented.

Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known
pending customer returns or allowances.

Foreign Currency Translation

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company’s Ireland and Singapore subsidiaries.
Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into U.S.
dollars, and the resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of income
under interest and other income (expense), net. The remeasurement gains or losses were immaterial
for all fiscal periods presented.

The local currency is the functional currency for each of the Company’s other wholly-owned foreign
subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at
month-end exchange rates and statements of income are translated at the average monthly exchange
rates. Exchange gains or losses arising from translation of foreign currency denominated assets
and liabilities (i.e., cumulative translation adjustment) are included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Derivative Financial Instruments

To reduce financial risk, the Company periodically enters into financial arrangements as part of
the Company’s ongoing asset and liability management activities. Xilinx uses derivative financial
instruments to hedge fair values of underlying assets and liabilities or future cash flows which
are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company does not enter into derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. See “Note 5. Derivative Financial Instruments”
for detailed information about the Company’s derivative financial instruments.



Research and Development Expenses

Research and development costs are current period expenses and charged to expense as incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has equity incentive plans that are more fully discussed in “Note 6. Stock-Based
Compensation Plans.” The authoritative guidance of accounting for share-based payment requires the
Company to measure the cost of all employee equity awards that are expected to be exercised based
on the grant-date fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over
the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award (over
the vesting period of the award). In addition, the Company is required to record compensation
expense (as previous awards continue to vest) for the unvested portion of previously granted awards
that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. The authoritative guidance of accounting for
share-based payment requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a
part of cash flows from financing activities. Excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from
tax deductions for exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock
compensation costs for such options. The exercise price of employee stock options is equal to the
market price of Xilinx common stock (defined as the closing trading price reported by The NASDAQ
Global Select Market) on the date of grant. Additionally, Xilinx’s employee stock purchase plan is
deemed a compensatory plan under the authoritative guidance of accounting for share-based payment.
Accordingly, the employee stock purchase plan is included in the computation of stock-based
compensation expense.

The Company uses the straight-line attribution method to recognize stock-based compensation costs
over the requisite service period of the award for stock-based awards granted after April 1, 2006.
For stock-based awards granted prior to April 2, 2006, the Company continues to use the accelerated
amortization method consistent with the amounts previously disclosed in the pro forma disclosure.
Upon exercise, cancellation or expiration of stock options, deferred tax assets for options with
multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if
each award had a separate vesting period. To calculate the excess tax benefits available for use in
offsetting future tax shortfalls as of the date of implementation, the Company followed the
alternative transition method.

Income Taxes

All income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method under the accounting for income
taxes, as interpreted by FASB authoritative guidance for measuring uncertain tax positions

.

Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial and income tax reporting purposes.

Product Warranty and Indemnification

The Company generally sells products with a limited warranty for product quality. The Company
provides an accrual for known product issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
As of the end of both fiscal 2010 and 2009, the accrual balance of the product warranty liability
was immaterial.

The Company offers, subject to certain terms and conditions, to indemnify certain customers and
distributors for costs and damages awarded against these parties in the event the Company’s
hardware products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, including
patents, copyrights or trademarks, and to compensate certain customers for limited specified costs
they actually incur in the event our hardware products experience epidemic failure. To a lesser
extent, the Company may from time-to-time offer limited indemnification with respect to its
software products. The terms and conditions of these indemnity obligations are limited by
contract, which obligations are typically perpetual from the effective date of the agreement. The
Company has historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these
provisions and has not made any significant payments pursuant to these provisions. The Company
cannot estimate the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, that the Company may be
required to make as a result of these obligations due to the limited history of indemnification
claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular
claim and indemnification provision. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not
incur any financial liabilities in the future as a result of these obligations.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Avnet, one of the Company’s distributors, distributes the substantial majority of the Company’s
products worldwide. As of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009, Avnet accounted for 83% and 81% of the
Company’s total accounts receivable, respectively. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for
49%, 55% and 61% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. The percentage of accounts receivable due from Avnet and the percentage of worldwide
net revenues from Avnet are consistent with historical patterns.



Xilinx is subject to concentrations of credit risk primarily in its trade accounts receivable and
investments in debt securities to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance
sheet. The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables
through its credit evaluation process, collection terms, distributor sales to diverse end customers
and through geographical dispersion of sales. Xilinx generally does not require collateral for
receivables from its end customers or from distributors.

No end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented.

The Company mitigates concentrations of credit risk in its investments in debt securities by
currently investing approximately 93% of its portfolio in AA or higher grade securities as rated by
Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s Investors Service. The Company’s methods to arrive at investment
decisions are not solely based on the rating agencies’ credit ratings. Xilinx also performs
additional credit due diligence and conducts regular portfolio credit reviews, including a review
of counterparty credit risk related to the Company’s forward currency exchange contracts.
Additionally, Xilinx limits its investments in the debt securities of a single issuer based upon
the issuer’s credit rating and attempts to further mitigate credit risk by diversifying risk across
geographies and type of issuer. As of April 3, 2010, 49% and 51% of its investments in debt
securities were domestic and foreign issuers, respectively. See “Note 4. Financial Instruments”
for detailed information about the Company’s investment portfolio.

As of April 3, 2010, less than 4% of the Company’s $1.87 billion investment portfolio consisted of
student loan auction rate securities and all of these securities are rated AAA with the exception
of $8.3 million that were downgraded to an A rating during fiscal 2009. More than 98% of the
underlying assets that secure these securities are pools of student loans originated under the
FFELP that are substantially guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. These securities
experienced failed auctions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 due to liquidity issues in the
global credit markets. In a failed auction, the interest rates are reset to a maximum rate defined
by the contractual terms for each security. The Company has collected and expects to collect all
interest payable on these securities when due. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, $1.3 million and $1.4
million, respectively, of these student loan auction rate securities were redeemed for cash by the
issuers at par value. Because there can be no assurance of a successful auction in the future,
beginning with the quarter ended March 29, 2008, the student loan auction rate securities were
reclassified from short-term to long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The
maturity dates range from March 2023 to November 2047.

As of April 3, 2010, approximately 24% of the portfolio consisted of mortgage-backed securities.
All of the mortgage-backed securities in the investment portfolio are AAA rated and were issued by
U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies.

Since September 2007, the global credit markets have experienced adverse conditions that have
negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities.
During this time the global credit and capital markets experienced volatility and disruption due to
instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and
concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. While general conditions in the global credit
markets have improved, there is a risk that the Company may incur additional other-than-temporary
impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market conditions deteriorate or
the underlying assets fail to perform as anticipated. See “Note 4. Financial Instruments” for a
table of the Company’s available-for-sale securities.

Dependence on Independent Manufacturers and Subcontractors

The Company does not directly manufacture the finished silicon wafers used to manufacture its
products. Xilinx receives a substantial majority of its finished wafers from one independent wafer
manufacturer located in Taiwan. The Company is also dependent on a limited number of
subcontractors, primarily located in the Asia Pacific region, to provide semiconductor assembly,
test and shipment services.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance to eliminate the historical GAAP hierarchy
and establish only two levels of U.S. GAAP, authoritative and nonauthoritative. When launched on
July 1, 2009, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) became the single source of
authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP, except for rules and interpretive releases of the SEC, which
are sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other nongrandfathered, non-SEC
accounting literature not included in the ASC became nonauthoritative. The subsequent issuances of
new standards will be in the form of Accounting Standards Updates that will be included in the ASC.
This authoritative guidance was effective for financial statements for interim or annual reporting
periods ended after September 15, 2009. The Company adopted the new codification in the second
quarter of fiscal 2010. As the codification was not intended to change or alter existing GAAP, it
did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In August 2009, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance to provide additional guidance
(including illustrative examples) clarifying the measurement of liabilities at fair value. Among
other things, the guidance clarifies how the price of a traded debt security (i.e., an asset value)
should be considered in estimating the fair value of the issuer’s liability. This authoritative
guidance was effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after
its issuance, which for the Company was its third quarter of fiscal 2010, and it did not have a
significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



In October 2009, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance to update the accounting and
reporting requirements for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. This guidance
established a selling price hierarchy, which allows the use of an estimated selling price to
determine the selling price of a deliverable in cases where neither vendor-specific objective
evidence nor third-party evidence is available. This guidance is to be applied prospectively for
revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June
15, 2010, which for the Company is its fiscal 2012. Early adoption is permitted, and if this
update is adopted early in other than the first quarter of an entity’s fiscal year, then it must be
applied retrospectively to the beginning of that fiscal year. The Company is currently assessing
the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance that clarifies which revenue allocation
and measurement guidance should be used for arrangements that contain both tangible products and
software, in cases where the software is more than incidental to the tangible product as a whole.
More specifically, if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential
to the functionality of the tangible product, then this software as well as undelivered software
elements that relate to this software are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue
guidance. This guidance is to be applied prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which for the Company is
its fiscal 2012. Early adoption is permitted, and if this update is adopted early in other than
the first quarter of an entity’s fiscal year, then it must be applied retrospectively to the
beginning of that fiscal year. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption on
its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2010, the FASB issued amended standards that require additional disclosures about inputs
and valuation techniques used to measure fair value as well as disclosures about significant
transfers, beginning in the Company’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Additionally, these amended
standards require presentation of disaggregated activity within the reconciliation for fair value
measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), beginning in the Company’s first
quarter of fiscal 2012. The Company does not expect these new standards to have significant impacts
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2010, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance to amend the subsequent event
disclosure requirement for public companies. Under this amended guidance, public companies are no
longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in
originally issued and revised financial statements. This guidance was effective immediately and the
Company adopted this new guidance in the quarter ended April 3, 2010. See “Note 21. Subsequent
Event” for further information.

In April 2010, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance on milestone method of revenue
recognition. Under the new guidance, an entity can recognize revenue from consideration that is
contingent upon achievement of a milestone in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if
the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive. This guidance is to be applied
prospectively for milestones achieved in fiscal years, and interim period within those years,
beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which for the Company is its fiscal 2012. Early adoption is
permitted, and if this update is adopted early in other than the first quarter of an entity’s
fiscal year, then it must be applied retrospectively to the beginning of that fiscal year. The
Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 3. Fair Value Measurements

The guidance for fair value measurements established by the FASB defines fair value as the exchange
price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining
the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair
value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which Xilinx would
transact and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset
or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.

The Company determines the fair value for marketable debt securities using industry standard
pricing services, data providers and other third-party sources and by internally performing
valuation analyses. The Company primarily uses a consensus price or weighted average price for its
fair value assessment. The Company determines the consensus price using market prices from a
variety of industry standard pricing services, data providers, security master files from large
financial institutions and other third party sources and uses those multiple prices as inputs into
a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value. The pricing services use
multiple inputs to determine market prices, including reportable trades, benchmark yield curves,
credit spreads and broker/dealer quotes as well as other industry and economic events. For certain
securities with short maturities, such as discount commercial paper and certificates of deposit,
the security is accreted from purchase price to face value at maturity. If a subsequent
transaction on the same security is observed in the marketplace, the price on the subsequent
transaction is used as the current daily market price and the security will be accreted to face
value based on the revised price. For certain other securities, such as student loan auction rate
securities, the Company performs its own valuation analysis using a discounted cash flow pricing
model.



The Company validates the consensus prices by taking random samples from each asset type and
corroborating those prices using reported trade activity, benchmark yield curves, binding
broker/dealer quotes or other relevant price information. There have not been any changes to the
Company’s fair value methodology during fiscal 2010 and the Company did not adjust or override any
fair value measurements as of April 3, 2010.

Fair Value Hierarchy

The measurements of fair value were established based on a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
the utilized inputs. This hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value framework
requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions
(inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. The guidance for fair value measurements
requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of
the following categories:

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

The Company’s Level 1 assets consist of U.S. Treasury securities and money market funds.

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

The Company’s Level 2 assets consist of bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate
bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities, foreign government and agency securities,
floating-rate notes and mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities
include foreign currency forward contracts.

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no
market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or
liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are
determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation
techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.

The Company’s Level 3 assets and liabilities include student loan auction rate securities and the
embedded derivative related to the Company’s debentures.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair
value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the
significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment,
including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The following tables
present information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009:

comprised of $61.6 million of student loan auction rate securities. Auction failures during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and the lack of market activity and liquidity required that the
Company’s student loan auction rate securities be measured using observable market data and Level 3
inputs. The fair values of the Company’s student loan auction rate securities were based on the
Company’s assessment of the underlying collateral and the creditworthiness of the issuers of the
securities. More than 98% of the underlying assets that secure the student loan auction rate
securities are pools of student loans originated under FFELP that are substantially guaranteed by
the U.S. Department of Education. The fair values of the Company’s student loan auction rate
securities were determined using a discounted cash flow pricing model that incorporated financial
inputs such as projected cash flows, discount rates, expected interest rates to be paid to
investors and an estimated liquidity discount. The weighted-average life over which cash flows
were projected was determined to be approximately nine years, given the collateral composition of
the securities. The discount rates that were applied to the pricing model were based on market data
and information for comparable- or similar-term student loan asset-backed securities. During fiscal
2010, the discount rate decreased by approximately 1.4 to 1.5 percentage points. The expected
interest rate to be paid to investors in a failed auction was determined by the contractual terms
for each security. The liquidity discount represents an estimate of the additional return an
investor would require to compensate for the lack of liquidity of the student loan auction rate
securities. The Company does not intend to sell, nor does it believe it is more likely than not
that it would be required to sell, the student loan auction rate securities before anticipated
recovery, which could be at final maturity that ranges from March 2023 to November 2047. Because
there can be no assurance of a successful auction in the future, all of the Company’s student loan
auction rate securities are recorded in long-term investments on its consolidated balance sheets.
All of the Company’s student loan auction rate securities are rated AAA with the exception of $8.3
million that were downgraded to an A rating during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.

In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00 billion principal amount of debentures to an initial
purchaser in a private offering. As a result of the repurchases in fiscal 2009, the remaining
principal amount of the debentures as of April 3, 2010 was $689.6 million. The fair value of the
debentures as of April 3, 2010 was approximately $640.8 million, based on the last trading price of
the debentures. The debentures included embedded features that qualify as an embedded derivative
under authoritative guidance issued by the FASB. The embedded derivative was separately accounted
for as a discount on the debentures and its fair value was established at the inception of the
debentures. Each quarter, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative, if any, is
recorded in the consolidated statements of income. The Company uses a derivative valuation model
to derive the value of the embedded derivative. Key inputs into this valuation model are the
Company’s current stock price, risk-free interest rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock
volatility and the debenture’s credit spread over London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The first three inputs are based on
observable market data while the last two inputs require management judgment and are Level 3
inputs.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

As of April 3, 2010, the Company had non-marketable equity securities in private companies of $17.7
million (adjusted cost). The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of private
companies are accounted for by using the cost method. The fair value of the Company’s cost method
investments is not estimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may
have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of these investments. These investments are
measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily
impaired. In determining whether a decline in value of non-marketable equity investments in
private companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an assessment is made by considering
available evidence, including the general market conditions in the investee’s industry, the
investee’s product development status and subsequent rounds of financing and the related valuation
and/or Xilinx’s participation in such financings. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability
to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the individual
investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash and the investee’s need for
possible additional funding at a lower valuation. The valuation methodology for determining the
fair value of non-marketable equity securities is based on the factors noted above which require
management judgment and are Level 3 inputs. The Company recognized impairment losses on
non-marketable equity investments of $3.8 million, $3.0 million and $2.9 million during fiscal
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, due to the weak financial condition of certain investees. The
entire amount of each of the impaired non-marketable equity investments was written off.

The gross unrealized losses on these investments were primarily due to adverse conditions in the
global credit markets in fiscal 2010 and 2009. The Company reviewed the investment portfolio and
determined that the gross unrealized losses on these investments as of April 3, 2010 and March 28,
2009 were temporary in nature. The aggregate of individual unrealized losses that had been
outstanding for 12 months or more were not significant as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009. The
Company neither intends to sell these investments nor concludes that it is more-likely-than-not
that it will have to sell them until recovery of their carrying values. The Company also believes
that it will be able to collect both principal and interest amounts due to the Company at maturity,
given the high credit quality of these investments and any related underlying collateral.

As part of the Company’s strategy to reduce volatility of operating expenses due to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations, the Company employs a hedging program with a five-quarter forward
outlook for major foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses. The outstanding forward
currency exchange contracts expire at various dates between April 2010 and April 2011. The net
unrealized gain or loss, which approximates the fair market value of the above contracts, is
expected to be realized and reclassified into net income within the next 12 months.

As of April 3, 2010, all the forward foreign currency exchange contracts were designated and
qualified as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the gain or loss on the forward contract
was reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into net income in the
same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the
gain or loss on the forward contract was immaterial and included in the net income for all periods
presented.

The Company may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments
such as the acquisition of capital expenditures. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward
contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment
has been attained and the hedged relationship has been effective, are deferred and included in
income or expenses in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses
on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the
consolidated statements of income as they are incurred.

The debentures include provisions which qualify as an embedded derivative. See “Note 14.
Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility” for detailed discussion about the embedded
derivative. The embedded derivative was separated from the debentures and its fair value was
established at the inception of the debentures. Any subsequent change in fair value of the
embedded derivative would be recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of income. The fair
value of the embedded derivative at inception of the debentures was $2.5 million and it changed to
$848 thousand and $2.1 million as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009, respectively. The changes
in the fair value of the embedded derivative of $1.3 million and $170 thousand during fiscal 2010
and 2009, respectively, were recorded to interest and other income (expense), net on the Company’s
consolidated statement of income.



The following table summarizes the fair value and presentation in the consolidated balance sheets

Note 6. Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company’s equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term retention programs that cover
employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. These plans are intended to
attract and retain talented employees, consultants and non-employee directors and to provide such
persons with a proprietary interest in the Company.

Stock-Based Compensation

In accordance with the authoritative guidance of accounting for share-based payment, the Company
adjusts stock-based compensation on a quarterly basis for changes to the estimate of expected
equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture experience. The effect of adjusting the
forfeiture rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is
changed. The actual forfeiture true up and estimate adjustments in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
$16.7 million, $15.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively.



As of both April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009, the ending inventory balances included $1.1 million of
capitalized stock-based compensation. The net stock-based compensation capitalized to or released
from inventory during fiscal 2010 and 2009 were immaterial. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
tax benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises and other awards, including
amounts credited to additional paid-in capital, totaled $9.3 million, $11.4 million and $25.3
million.

The fair values of stock options and stock purchase plan rights under the Company’s equity
incentive plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated as of the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company’s expected stock price volatility assumption for
stock options is estimated using implied volatility of the Company’s traded options. The expected
life of options granted is based on the historical exercise activity as well as the expected
disposition of all options outstanding. The expected life of options granted also considers the
actual contractual term. The per-share weighted-average fair values of stock options granted during
fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $5.68, $7.28 and $7.23, respectively. The per share
weighted-average fair values of stock purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $6.29, $6.45 and $7.20, respectively. The fair values
of stock options and stock purchase plan rights granted in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
estimated at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:

The Company began granting restricted stock units (RSUs) in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The
estimated fair values of RSU awards were calculated based on the market price of Xilinx common
stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on Xilinx
common stock prior to vesting. The per share weighted-average fair values of RSUs granted during
fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $20.38, $21.89 and $24.46, respectively. The weighted-average fair
values of RSUs granted in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were calculated based on estimates at the date
of grant as follows:




Risk-free interest rate

These amounts represent the difference between the exercise price and
$25.68, the closing price per share of Xilinx’s stock on April 1, 2010, for all
in-the-money options outstanding.

Options outstanding that are expected to vest are net of estimated future option forfeitures in
accordance with the authoritative guidance of accounting for share-based payment, which are
estimated when compensation costs are recognized. Options with a fair value of $28.3 million
completed vesting during fiscal 2010. As of April 3, 2010, total unrecognized stock-based
compensation costs related to stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan was $30.7 million and
$10.1 million, respectively. The total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost for stock
options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.2 years and 0.7 years, respectively.



Employee Stock Option Plans

Under the Company’s stock option plans (Option Plans), options reserved for future issuance of
common shares to employees and directors of the Company total 43.3 million shares as of April 3,
2010, including 12.3 million shares available for future grants under the 2007 Equity Incentive
Plan (2007 Equity Plan). Options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock under the Option
Plans are granted at 100% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. The
contractual term for stock awards granted under the 2007 Equity Plan is seven years from the grant
date. Prior to April 1, 2007, stock options granted by the Company generally expire ten years
from the grant date. Stock awards granted to existing and newly hired employees generally vest
over a four-year period from the date of grant.

The 2007 Equity Plan, which became effective on January 1, 2007,
replaced both the Company’s 1997 Stock Plan (which expired on May 8, 2007) and the Supplemental
Stock Option Plan and all available but unissued shares under these prior plans were cancelled as
of April 1, 2007. The 2007 Equity Plan is now Xilinx’s only plan for providing stock-based awards
to eligible employees and non-employee directors. The types of awards allowed under the 2007 Equity Plan include incentive stock options,
non-qualified stock options, RSUs, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. To date, the
Company has issued a mix of non-qualified stock options and RSUs under the 2007 Equity Plan. The
mix of stock options and RSU awards will change depending upon the grade level of the employees.
Employees at the lower grade levels will receive mostly RSUs and may also receive stock options,
whereas employees at the higher grade levels, including the Company’s executive officers, will
receive mostly stock options and may also receive RSUs.



The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2010 and 2009 was $3.0 million
and $18.1 million, respectively. This intrinsic value represents the difference between the
exercise price and the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise.

Since the Company adopted the policy of retiring all repurchased shares of its common stock, new
shares are issued upon employees’ exercise of their stock options.

RSUs with a fair value of $20.0 million were vested during fiscal 2010. As of April 3, 2010, total
unrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to non-vested RSUs was $63.5 million. The
total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost for RSUs is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 2.6 years.



Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan

Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, qualified employees can obtain a 24-month purchase right to
purchase the Company’s common stock at the end of each six-month exercise period. Participation is
limited to 15% of the employee’s annual earnings up to a maximum of $21 thousand in a calendar
year. Approximately 80% of all eligible employees participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of
the 24-month offering period or at the end of each six-month exercise period. Employees purchased
2.0 million shares for $28.0 million in fiscal 2010, 2.2 million shares for $34.5 million in fiscal
2009, and 2.1 million shares for $36.6 million in fiscal 2008. As of April 3, 2010, 7.7 million
shares were available for future issuance out of the 42.5 million shares authorized.

Note 8. Restructuring Charges

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company announced restructuring measures designed to
drive structural operating efficiencies across the company. The Company completed this
restructuring plan by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and reduced its global
workforce by approximately 200 positions, or about 6%. These employee terminations impact various
geographies and functions worldwide. The Company recorded total restructuring charges of $30.1
million in fiscal 2010, primarily related to severance costs and benefits expenses.

remaining accrual as of April 3, 2010 primarily relates to severance costs and benefits that are
expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2011.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company announced a functional reorganization pursuant
to which it eliminated 249 positions, or approximately 7% of its global workforce. These employee
terminations occurred across various geographies and functions worldwide. The reorganization plan
was completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009.



The Company recorded total restructuring charges of $22.0 million in connection with the
reorganization in fiscal 2009. These charges consisted of
$20.5 million of severance costs and
benefits expenses and $1.5 million of facility-related costs.

Note 9. Impairment Loss on Investments

The Company recorded an impairment loss on investments in non-marketable equity securities of $3.8
million and $2.9 million for fiscal 2010 and 2008, respectively, due to the weak financial
condition of certain investees. The Company recognized impairment losses on investments of $54.1
million during fiscal 2009, which consisted of $51.1 million impairment losses related to
marketable debt and equity securities and $3.0 million impairment losses in non-marketable equity
securities.

Of the $54.1 million impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2009, $38.0 million was related to
senior class asset-backed securities where the issuer went into receivership. The receiver
subsequently sought judicial interpretation of a provision of a legal document governing the
issuer’s securities. As a result of the outcome of the judicial determination, the receiver
immediately liquidated the substantial majority of the issuer’s assets, and in accordance with the
court order, the proceeds were used to repay short-term liabilities in the order in which they fell
due. In December 2008, the receiver reported to the issuer’s creditors the outcome of the judicial
determination and that the issuer’s liabilities substantially exceeded its assets. As a result, the
receiver estimated that the issuer would not be able to pay any liabilities falling due after
October 2008 regardless of the seniority or status of the securities. Based on these developments,
the Company concluded that it was not likely that we would recover the balance of its investment.
This decline in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary and, therefore, the Company
recognized an impairment loss of $38.0 million on these securities during fiscal 2009. In October
2009, a higher court reversed the initial judicial interpretation and determined that the proceeds
should be used to repay short-term liabilities on a pari passu basis. Given the significant
liabilities of the issuer, it is uncertain whether the Company will recover any of its original
investment. The Company has not recognized any amount that may be due back to the Company.

The Company also recognized an additional impairment loss of $10.0 million on marketable debt
securities in its investment portfolio during fiscal 2009, $9.0 million of which was due to the
bankruptcy filing by one of the issuers of the marketable debt securities.

In addition to the aforementioned amounts, the Company recorded $3.1 million of impairment losses
in marketable equity securities investment during fiscal 2009 as a result of the continued decline
in its market value, which led the Company to believe that the decline in the market value was
other than temporary. Furthermore, during the same period the Company recorded $3.0 million of
write down of its investment in non-marketable equity securities in private companies, which was
recorded due primarily to the weak financial condition of certain investees.

Note 10. Commitments

Xilinx leases some of its facilities and office buildings under non-cancelable operating leases
that expire at various dates through October 2018. Additionally, Xilinx entered into a land lease
in conjunction with the Company’s building in Singapore, which will expire in November 2035 and the
lease cost was settled in an up-front payment in June 2006. Some of the operating leases for
facilities and office buildings require payment of operating costs, including property taxes,
repairs, maintenance and insurance. Most of the Company’s leases contain renewal options for
varying terms. Approximate future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are
as follows:

Aggregate future rental income to be received, which includes rents from both owned and leased
property, totaled $9.0 million as of April 3, 2010. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all
operating leases was $5.3 million for fiscal 2010, $9.2 million for fiscal 2009, and $8.2 million
for fiscal 2008. Rental income, which includes rents received from both owned and leased property,
was not material for fiscal 2010, 2009 or 2008.

Other commitments as of April 3, 2010 totaled $129.5 million and consisted of purchases of
inventory and other non-cancelable purchase obligations related to subcontractors that manufacture
silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The Company expects to receive and pay
for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and
quality specifications. As of April 3, 2010, the Company also had $10.0 million of non-cancelable
license obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and hardware/software
maintenance expiring at various dates through September 2011.

The Company committed up to $5.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to intellectual property
until July 2023. License payments will be amortized over the useful life of the intellectual
property acquired.

Note 11. Net Income Per Common Share

The computation of basic net income per common share for all periods presented is derived from the
information on the consolidated statements of income, and there are no reconciling items in the
numerator used to compute diluted net income per common share. The total shares used in the
denominator of the diluted net income per common share calculation includes 941 thousand, 741
thousand, and 3.6 million potentially dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding for fiscal
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, that are not included in basic net income per common share.
Potentially dilutive common equivalent shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method
to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs and
the assumed issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Outstanding stock options and RSUs to purchase approximately 44.0 million, 44.1 million and 39.9
million shares, for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, under the Company’s stock award plans
were excluded from diluted net income per common share, applying the treasury stock method, as
their inclusion would have been antidilutive. These options and RSUs could be dilutive in the
future if the Company’s average share price increases and is greater than the combined exercise
prices and the unamortized fair values of these options and RSUs.

Diluted net income per common share does not include any incremental shares issuable upon the
exchange of the debentures (see “Note 14. Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility”).
The debentures will have no impact on diluted net income per common share until the price of the
Company’s common stock exceeds the conversion price of $30.48 per share, because the principal
amount of the debentures will be settled in cash upon conversion. Prior to conversion, the Company
will include, in the diluted net income per common share calculation, the effect of the additional
shares that may be issued when the Company’s common stock price exceeds $30.48 per share, using the
treasury stock method. The conversion price of $30.48 per share represents the adjusted conversion
price due to the accumulation of cash dividends distributed to the common stockholders through
fiscal 2010.

Note 14. Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility

3.125% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures

In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00 billion principal amount of 3.125% junior convertible
debentures due March 15, 2037, to an initial purchaser in a private offering. The debentures are
subordinated in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future senior debt and to the other
liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. The debentures were initially convertible, subject to
certain conditions, into shares of Xilinx common stock at a conversion rate of 32.0760 shares of
common stock per $1 thousand principal amount of debentures, representing an initial effective
conversion price of approximately $31.18 per share of common stock. The conversion rate is subject
to adjustment for certain events as outlined in the indenture governing the debentures but will not
be adjusted for accrued interest. Due to the accumulation of cash dividend distributions to common
stockholders, the conversion rate for the debentures was adjusted to 32.8092 shares of common stock
per $1 thousand principal amount of debentures, representing an adjusted conversion price of $30.48
per share at the end of fiscal 2010.

The Company received net proceeds from issuance of the debentures of $980.0 million after deduction
of issuance costs of $20.0 million. During fiscal 2009, the Company paid $193.2 million in cash to
repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount) of its debentures, resulting in approximately $689.6
million of principal amount of debt outstanding as of April 3, 2010. The debt issuance costs, as
adjusted for the retrospective adoption of the authoritative guidance for convertible debentures
issued by the FASB, are recorded in long-term other assets and are being amortized to interest
expense over 30 years. Cash interest of 3.125% (per annum) is payable semiannually in arrears on
March 15 and September 15, beginning on September 15, 2007. However, the Company recognizes an
effective interest rate of 7.20% on the carrying value of the debentures. The effective rate is
based on the interest rate for a similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. The
debentures also have a contingent interest component that may require the Company to pay interest
based on certain thresholds beginning with the semi-annual interest period commencing on March 15,
2014 (the maximum amount of contingent interest that will accrue is 0.50% per year) and upon the
occurrence of certain events, as outlined in the indenture governing the debentures.

Beginning in fiscal 2010, the Company retrospectively adopted the authoritative guidance for
convertible debentures issued by the FASB. The authoritative guidance specifies that issuers of
convertible debt instruments should separately account for the liability (debt) and equity
(conversion option) components of such instruments in a manner that reflects the borrowing rate for
a similar non-convertible debt. See “Adoption of New Accounting Standard for Convertible
Debentures” included in “Note 1. Basis of Presentation” for further information relating to the
adoption.



The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the debentures, after the
retrospective adoption, are reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as follows:

3, 2010, the remaining term of the debentures is 27 years. Interest expense related to the
debentures was included in interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements

As adjusted for the retrospective adoption of the accounting standard for convertible
debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (see Note 2)

On or after March 15, 2014, the Company may redeem all or part of the remaining debentures
outstanding for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest if the closing price of
the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at
least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which the
Company provides notice of redemption. Upon conversion, the Company would pay the holder the cash
value of the applicable number of shares of Xilinx common stock, up to the principal amount of the
debentures. If the conversion value exceeds $1 thousand, the Company may also deliver, at its
option, cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock for the conversion value in
excess of $1 thousand (conversion spread). There would be no adjustment to the numerator in the
net income per common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that
portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash. The conversion spread will be
included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share, using the
treasury stock method.

Holders of the debentures may convert their debentures only upon the occurrence of certain events
in the future, as outlined in the indenture. In addition, holders of the debentures who convert
their debentures in connection with a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture, may be
entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally,
in the event of a fundamental change, the holders of the debentures may require Xilinx to purchase
all or a portion of their debentures at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. As of April 3, 2010, none of the conditions
allowing holders of the debentures to convert had been met.

The Company concluded that the embedded features related to the contingent interest payments and
the Company making specific types of distributions (e.g., extraordinary dividends) qualify as
derivatives and should be bundled as a compound embedded derivative. The fair value of the
derivative at the date of issuance of the debentures was $2.5 million and is accounted for as a
discount on the debentures. Due to the repurchase of a portion of the debentures in fiscal 2009,
the carrying value of the derivative was reduced to $1.6 million and will continue to be amortized
to interest expense over the remaining term of the debentures. The fair value of the derivative as
of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009 was $848 thousand and $2.1 million, respectively. Any change in
fair value of this embedded derivative will be included in interest and other income (expense), net
on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The Company also concluded that the debentures
are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion option
qualifies as a derivative. In addition, the Company has concluded that the embedded conversion
option would be classified in stockholders’ equity if it were a freestanding instrument.
Accordingly, the embedded conversion option is not required to be accounted for separately.

Revolving Credit Facility

In April 2007, Xilinx entered into a five-year $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit
facility with a syndicate of banks. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a
benchmark rate plus an applicable margin based upon the Company’s credit rating. In connection
with the credit facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial and non-financial
covenants. As of April 3, 2010, the Company had made no borrowings under this credit facility and
was not in violation of any of the covenants.



Note 15. Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation authorized 2.0 million shares of undesignated preferred
stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. The Board of Directors is
authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or
imposed upon any wholly unissued series of preferred stock. As of April 3, 2010 and March 28,
2009, no preferred shares were issued or outstanding.

The Board of Directors has approved stock repurchase programs enabling the Company to repurchase
its common stock in the open market or through negotiated transactions with independent financial
institutions. In February 2007, the Board authorized a $1.50 billion repurchase program (2007
Repurchase Program). In February 2008, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $800.0 million
of common stock (2008 Repurchase Program). In November 2008, the Board of Directors approved an
amendment to the Company’s 2008 Repurchase Program to provide that the funds may also be used to
repurchase outstanding debentures. The 2008 Repurchase Program has no stated expiration date.
Through April 3, 2010, the Company had used the entire amount authorized under the 2007 Repurchase
program and $424.3 million out of the $800.0 million authorized under the 2008 Repurchase Program.
Out of the $424.3 million used under the 2008 Repurchase Program, $231.1 million was used to
repurchase 9.4 million shares of its outstanding common stock and $193.2 million was used to
repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount) of its debentures. See “Note 14. Convertible
Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility” for additional information about the debentures. The
Company’s current policy is to retire all repurchased shares and debentures, and consequently, no
treasury shares or debentures were held as of April 3, 2010 or March 28, 2009.

During fiscal 2009, the Company entered into stock repurchase agreements with independent financial
institutions to repurchase shares under both the 2007 Repurchase Program and 2008 Repurchase
Program. Under these agreements, Xilinx provided these financial institutions with up-front
payments totaling $275.0 million for fiscal 2009. These financial institutions agreed to deliver
to Xilinx a certain number of shares based upon the volume weighted-average price, during an
averaging period, less a specified discount. Under these arrangements, the Company repurchased
10.8 million shares of common stock for $275.0 million during fiscal 2009, of which $81.1 million
was purchased under the 2008 Repurchase Program while the remaining balance of $193.9 million was
purchased under the 2007 Repurchase Program. There were no such arrangements in fiscal 2010. During
fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock in the open market for a
total of $150.0 million under the 2008 Repurchase Program. As of April 3, 2010, no amounts remained
outstanding under any stock repurchase agreements and all related shares had been delivered to the
Company.

The tax benefits (expenses) associated with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase
plan recorded in additional paid-in capital were $(4.4) million, $4.2 million and $15.8 million,
for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

As of April 3, 2010, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $17.5 million. If unused, these carryforwards will expire in 2013 through 2026. The
Company had federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards of approximately $91.2 million, federal
affordable housing tax credit carryforwards of approximately $5.6 million and no other state credit
carryforwards. If unused, $8.7 million of the tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2023 through
2030. The remainder of the credits has no expiration date.

Unremitted foreign earnings that are considered to be permanently invested outside the U. S. and on
which no U.S. taxes have been provided, are approximately $945.6 million as of April 3, 2010. The
residual U.S. tax liability, if such amounts were remitted, would be
approximately $296.3 million.

The Company has manufacturing operations in Singapore where the Company has been granted “Pioneer
Status” that is effective through fiscal 2021. The Pioneer Status reduces the Company’s tax on the
majority of Singapore income from 17% to zero. The benefit of Pioneer Status in Singapore for
fiscal 2010 is approximately $18.7 million ($0.07 per common share) on income considered
permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The tax effect of operations in low tax jurisdictions on
the Company’s overall tax rate is reflected in the table above.

The Company adjusted the cumulative effect of adopting FASB authoritative guidance for measuring
uncertain tax positions in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 in connection with a change in
estimate related to the application of certain historical tax elections. As a result, retained
earnings and deferred tax liabilities decreased by $10.1 million and $18.2 million, respectively,
and long-term income taxes payable increased by $28.3 million.

If the remaining balance of $96.3 million and $115.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of
April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009, respectively, were realized in a future period, it would result
in a tax benefit of $66.5 million and $58.5 million, respectively, thereby reducing the effective
tax rate.

The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within
the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. The balance of accrued
interest and penalties was $3.1 million and $4.0 million as of April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009,
respectively. Interest and penalties included in (released from) the Company’s provision for
income taxes totaled $(900) thousand and $1.1 million for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state audits by taxing authorities for years
through fiscal 2004. The U.S. federal statute of limitations on fiscal 2006 has also expired. The
Company is no longer subject to tax audits in Ireland for years through fiscal 2004.

On December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit
adjustments for fiscal 2005. The Company filed a petition with the Tax Court on March 2, 2009, in
response to this notice of deficiency. The Company began negotiations with the IRS Appeals Division
on this matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. On March 22, 2010, the Company settled the
proposed adjustment related to acquired technology with no net change in tax liability. The
Company believes it has provided adequate reserves for the other proposed adjustments to fiscal
2005. It is impractical to determine the amount of uncertain tax benefits that will significantly
increase or decrease within the next 12 months prior to settlement of the remaining issues.

The IRS audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Company’s tax returns for fiscal 1996
through 2001. The Company filed petitions with the Tax Court in response to assertions by the IRS
relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. Except to the extent there is a further appeal by the IRS,
all issues have been settled with the IRS in this matter as described below.

On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options
must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with the
Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement, and
thus, the Company had no tax, interest, or penalties due for this issue. The Tax Court entered its
decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Appeals Court). The Company and the IRS presented oral arguments to
a three-judge panel of the Appeals Court on March 12, 2008. On May 27, 2009, the Company received
a 2-1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision and holding
that the Company should include stock option amounts in its cost sharing agreement with Xilinx
Ireland. As a result, the Company recorded expense of $8.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal
2010 in order to reverse the interest income it accrued through March 28, 2009 on the earlier
prepayment it made to the IRS. As a result of the May 27, 2009 decision, the Company increased its
accrual for penalties and interest in the first quarter from $4.0 million to $21.9 million. The
Company did not agree with the Appeals Court decision and filed a motion for rehearing on August
12, 2009. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing both the majority and
dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009. On March 22, 2010 the Appeals Court in a 2-1
majority opinion affirmed the Tax Court decision in Xilinx’s favor. As a result of the March 2010
decision, the Company expects to receive a refund from the IRS of approximately $25.2 million and
interest of approximately $9.4 million. The accrual for penalties and interest decreased from
$21.5 million in the third quarter to $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, primarily
as a result of the March 2010 decision.



Note 17. Segment Information

Note 18. Litigation Settlements and Contingencies

Internal Revenue Service

The IRS audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Company’s tax returns for fiscal 1996
through 2001. The Company filed petitions with the Tax Court in response to assertions by the IRS
relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. Except to the extent there is a further appeal by the IRS,
all issues have been settled with the IRS in this matter as described below.

In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency
reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal 2005. The Company began negotiations with the IRS
Appeals Division on this matter in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. On March 22, 2010, the
Company settled the proposed adjustment related to acquired technology with no net change in tax
liability. The Company believes it has adequate reserves for the remaining issues.



Patent Litigation

On November 5, 2009, Agere Systems, Inc. (Agere), a wholly-owned subsidiary of LSI Corporation
(LSI), filed an action for patent infringement and breach of contract of a patent license agreement
against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (

Agere Systems Inc. v. Xilinx,
Inc.

, Index No. 603382/09, the New York State Action). This action was ultimately removed to U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, and consolidated with the Company’s related
actions against Agere and LSI. On April 2, 2010, Xilinx and LSI reached a resolution on the
foregoing matters and all outstanding litigation between Xilinx and LSI and Agere have been
dismissed with prejudice. This resolution did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

On December 28, 2007, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG (PACT)
against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division
(PACT XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No. 2:07-CV-563). The lawsuit
pertains to 11 different patents and PACT seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages, interest
and attorneys’ fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to the
Company is estimable at this time.

Other Matters

Except as stated above, there are no pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the
Company is a party or of which any of its property is the subject.

Note 19. Goodwill and Acquisition-Related Intangibles

amortized as of the end of the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2010. Acquisition-related
intangible assets were amortized on a straight-line basis.



Note 20. Employee Benefit Plans

Xilinx offers various retirement benefit plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total
contributions to these plans were $9.3 million, $9.9 million and $8.1 million in fiscal 2010, 2009
and 2008, respectively. For employees in the U.S., effective July 1, 2008, Xilinx instituted a
Company matching program pursuant to which the Company will match contributions to Xilinx’s 401(k)
Plan (the 401(k) Plan) based on the amount of salary deferral contributions the participant makes
to the 401(k) Plan. Xilinx will match up to 50% of the first 8% of an employee’s compensation that
the employee contributed to their 401(k) account. Because the program was introduced mid-year, the
maximum Company match for calendar year 2008 was $2,250 per employee. For calendar year 2009 and
beyond, the maximum Company contribution per year is $4,500 per employee. Prior to July 1, 2008,
the Company made discretionary contributions to employee 401(k) accounts when performance targets
were met. As permitted under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 401(k) Plan allows
tax deferred salary deductions for eligible employees. The Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors administers the 401(k) Plan. Participants in the 401(k) Plan may make salary deferrals of
up to 25% of the eligible annual salary, limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the
Internal Revenue Code. Effective January 1, 2003, participants who have reached the age of 50
before the close of the plan year may be eligible to make catch-up salary deferral contributions,
up to 25% of eligible annual salary, limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal
Revenue Code.

The Company allows its U.S.-based officers, director-level employees, and its board members to
defer a portion of their compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan). The
Compensation Committee administers the Plan. As of April 3, 2010, there were approximately 135
participants in the Plan who self-direct their contributions into investment options offered by the
Plan. The Plan does not allow Plan participants to invest directly in Xilinx’s stock. In the
event Xilinx becomes insolvent, Plan assets are subject to the claims of the Company’s general
creditors. There are no Plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or minimum return on
investments. As of April 3, 2010, Plan assets were $32.0 million and obligations were $37.0
million. As of March 28, 2009, Plan assets were $21.3 million and obligations were $26.3 million.

Note 21. Subsequent Events

On April 27, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per common
share for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The dividend is payable on June 9, 2010 to
stockholders of record on May 19, 2010.



REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Xilinx, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xilinx, Inc. as of April 3, 2010
and March 28, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 3, 2010. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Part IV, Item 15(a)(2). These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Xilinx, Inc. at April 3, 2010 and March 28, 2009,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended April 3, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Xilinx, Inc. changed its method of
accounting for convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features during 2010.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Xilinx, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 3,
2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated June 1, 2010
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Xilinx, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of April 3, 2010, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Xilinx, Inc. as of April 3, 2010 and
March 28, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 3, 2010 of Xilinx, Inc. and our report
dated June 1, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out, under the supervision of and with the participation of Xilinx,
Inc.’s management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO
have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended April 3, 2010 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. This system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with
management’s authorization. The design, monitoring and revision of the system of internal control
over financial reporting involve, among other things, management’s judgments with respect to the
relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. The effectiveness of the system
of internal control over financial reporting is supported by the selection, retention and training
of qualified personnel and an organizational structure that provides an appropriate division of
responsibility and formalized procedures. The system of internal control is periodically reviewed
and modified in response to changing conditions.

Because of its inherent limitations, no matter how well designed, a system of internal control over
financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements or all fraud. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring
mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

Management has used the criteria established in the Report ‘

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework’

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to
evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this
evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of April 3, 2010.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 3, 2010
has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8. of this Form 10-K.

The Company ceased issuing options under the 1997 Stock Plan as of April 1, 2007. The 1997
Stock Plan expired on May 8, 2007 and all available but unissued shares under this plan were
cancelled.

3.6 
million shares issuable upon vesting of RSUs that the Company granted
under the 2007 Equity Plan.

(3)

The weighted-average exercise price does not take into account shares issuable upon vesting
of outstanding RSUs, which have no exercise price.

(4)

On July 26, 2006, the stockholders approved the adoption of the 2007 Equity Plan and
authorized 10.0 million shares to be reserved for issuance thereunder. The 2007 Equity Plan,
which became effective on January 1, 2007, replaced both the Company’s 1997 Stock Plan (which
expired on May 8, 2007) and the Supplemental Stock Option Plan. On August 9, 2007, August 14,
2008 and August 12, 2009 our stockholders authorized the reserve
of an additional 5.0 million shares, 4.0 million shares and 5.0 million shares respectively. All of the shares reserved for
issuance under the 2007 Equity Plan may be granted as stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock or RSUs.

(5)

In November 2000, the Company acquired RocketChips. Under the terms of the merger, the
Company assumed all of the stock options previously issued to RocketChips’ employees pursuant
to four different stock option plans. A total of approximately 807
thousand option shares were
assumed by the Company. Of this amount, a total of 3 thousand option shares, with an average
weighted exercise price of $18.71, remained outstanding as of April 3, 2010. These option
shares are excluded from the above table. All of the options assumed by the Company remain
subject to the terms of the RocketChips’ stock option plan under which they were issued.
Subsequent to acquiring RocketChips, the Company has not made any grants or awards under any
of the RocketChips’ stock option plans and the Company has no intention to do so in the
future.

(6)

Under the Supplemental Stock Option Plan, options were granted to employees and consultants
of the Company, however neither officers nor members of our Board were eligible for grants
under the Supplemental Stock Option Plan. Only non-qualified stock options were granted under
the Supplemental Stock Option Plan (that is, options that do not entitle the optionee to
special U.S. income tax treatment) and such options generally expire not later than 12 months
after the optionee ceases to be an employee or consultant. Upon a merger of the Company with
or into another company, or the sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets, each option
granted under the Supplemental Stock Option Plan may be assumed or substituted with a similar
option by the acquiring company, or the outstanding options will become exercisable in
connection with the merger or sale.
