ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx, the Company or we) designs, develops and markets programmable platforms.
These programmable platforms have several components:

•

integrated circuits (ICs) in the form of programmable logic devices (PLDs), including
Extensible Processing Platforms (EPPs);

•

software design tools to program the PLDs;

•

targeted reference designs;

•

printed circuit boards; and

•

intellectual property (IP), which consists of Xilinx and various third-party
verification and IP cores.

In addition to its programmable platforms, Xilinx provides design services, customer training,
field engineering and technical support.

Our PLDs include field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs)
that our customers program to perform desired logic functions and EPPs, which combine industry
standard ARM

®

processor-based systems with programmable logic in a single device. Our
products are designed to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment
manufacturers in end markets such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and
medical, aerospace and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data
processing. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors
and through direct sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by a network of independent
sales representative firms and by a direct sales management organization.

Xilinx was founded and incorporated in California in February 1984. In April 1990, the Company
reincorporated in Delaware. Our corporate facilities and executive offices are located at 2100
Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124, and our website address is www.xilinx.com.

Industry Overview

There are three principal types of ICs used in most digital electronic systems: processors, which
generally are utilized for control and computing tasks; memory devices, which are used for storing
program instructions and data; and logic devices, which generally are used to manage the
interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system. Xilinx designs and develops PLDs,
a type of logic device. Alternatives to PLDs include application specific integrated circuits
(ASICs) and application specific standard products (ASSPs). PLDs, ASICs and ASSPs compete with
each other since they may be utilized in many of the same types of applications within electronic
systems. However, variations in unit pricing, development cost, product performance, reliability,
power consumption, capacity, functionality, ease of use and time-to-market determine the degree to
which the devices compete for specific applications.

PLDs have key competitive advantages over competing ASICs and ASSPs, including:

•

Faster time-to-market and increased design flexibility. Both of these advantages are
enabled by Xilinx desktop software which allows users to implement and revise their designs
quickly. In contrast, ASICs and ASSPs require significant development time and offer
limited, if any, flexibility to make design changes.

•

PLDs are standard components. This means that the same device can be sold to many
different users for a myriad of applications. In sharp contrast, ASICs and ASSPs are
customized for an individual user or a specific application.



PLDs are generally disadvantaged in terms of relative device size. ASICs and ASSPs tend to be
smaller than PLDs, resulting in a lower unit cost. However, there is a high fixed cost associated
with ASIC and ASSP development that is not applicable to PLD customers. This fixed cost of
development is expected to significantly increase on next generation technology nodes. From a
total cost of development perspective, ASICs and ASSPs have generally been more cost effective when
used in high-volume production; and PLDs have generally been more cost effective when used in low-
to mid-volume production. However, we expect PLDs to be able to address higher volume applications
and gain market share from ASIC and ASSP suppliers as the fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development
increases on next generation technology nodes, eroding their respective cost advantages.

An overview of typical PLD end market applications for our products is shown in the following

Strategy and Competition

Our strategy for expansion is the displacement of ASICs and ASSPs in the development of next
generation electronic systems. The costs and risks associated with application-specific devices can
only be justified for a short list of high volume commodity products. Programmable platforms,
alternatively, are becoming critical for our customers to meet increasingly stringent product
requirements — cost, power, performance and density — in a business environment characterized by
increased complexity, shrinking market windows, rapidly changing market demands, capped engineering
budgets, escalating ASIC and ASSP non-recurring engineering costs and increased economic and
development risk.

With every new generation of FPGAs, our strategy is to increase the performance, densities and
system-level functionality, while driving down cost and power consumption at each manufacturing
process node. Secondly, our strategy is to provide simpler, smarter programmable platforms and
design methodologies that free up engineers to focus on end product innovation and differentiation.



Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and
characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence
and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors,
Altera Corporation (Altera), Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) and Microsemi Corporation
(Microsemi), and from new companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market
segment. In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing
since the inception of FPGAs, and the ASSP market. Other competitors include manufacturers of:

•

high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;

•

high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;

•

ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic;

•

high-speed, low-density CPLDs;

•

high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) devices;

•

products with embedded processors;

•

products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; and

•

other new or emerging programmable logic products.

We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include:

•

product pricing;

•

time-to-market;

•

product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density;

•

field upgradability;

•

adaptability of products to specific applications;

•

ease of use and functionality of software design tools;

•

availability and functionality of predefined IP;

•

inventory and supply chain management;

•

access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity; and

•

ability to provide timely customer service and support.

Artix-7 FPGAs offer the lowest power and system cost at higher performance than
alternative high volume FPGAs. These devices are targeted to high volume applications such
as handheld portable ultrasound devices, multi-function printers and software defined
radio.

The Zynq-7000 family is first family of Xilinx EPPs. This new class of product combines an
industry-standard ARM dual-core Cortex™-A9 MPCore™ processing system with Xilinx unified 28-nm
architecture. There are four devices in the Zynq-7000 EPP family that allow designers to target
cost sensitive as well as high-performance applications from a single platform using
industry-standard tools. These devices are expected to enable incremental market opportunities in
applications such as industrial motor control, driver assistance and smart surveillance systems.

40-nm and 45-nm Product Families

The Virtex-6 FPGA family consists of 13 devices and is the sixth generation in the Virtex series of
FPGAs. Virtex-6 FPGAs are fabricated on a high-performance, 40-nm process technology. There are
three Virtex-6 families, and each is optimized to deliver different feature mixes to address a
variety of markets as follows:

and the Spartan-3A family. Prior generation Spartan families include Spartan-IIE, Spartan-II,
Spartan XL and the original Spartan family.

CPLDs operate on the lowest end of the programmable logic density spectrum. CPLDs are single-chip,
nonvolatile solutions characterized by instant-on and universal interconnect. CPLDs combine the
advantages of ultra low power consumption with the benefits of high performance and low cost.
Prior generations of CPLDs include the CoolRunner and XC9500 product families.

EasyPath™ FPGAs

EasyPath FPGAs offer customers a fast, simple method of cost-reducing FPGA designs. EasyPath FPGAs
use the same production masks and fabrication process as standard FPGAs and are tested to a
specific customer application to improve yield and lower costs. As a result, EasyPath FPGAs
provide customers with significant cost reduction when compared to the standard FPGA devices
without the conversion risk, engineering effort, or the additional time required to move to an
ASIC. The latest generation of EasyPath FPGAs and EasyPath-7 FPGAs provide lower total product
cost of ownership for cost-reducing high performance FPGAs.

Design Platforms and Services

Programmable Platforms

We offer three types of programmable platforms that support our customers’ designs and reduce their
development efforts:

The Base Platform is the delivery vehicle for all of our new silicon offerings used to develop and
run customer-specific software applications and hardware designs. Released at launch, the Base
Platform is comprised of: FPGA silicon; Integrated Software Environment (ISE

®

) Design Suite design
environment; integration support of optional third-party synthesis, simulation, and signal
integrity tools; reference designs; development boards and IP.

The Domain-Specific Platform targets one of the three primary Xilinx FPGA user profiles: the
embedded processing developer; the DSP developer; or the logic/connectivity developer. It
accomplishes this by augmenting the Base Platform with a targeted set of integrated technologies,
including: higher-level design methodologies and tools; domain-specific IP including embedded, DSP
and connectivity; domain-specific development hardware and reference designs; and operating systems
and software.

The Market-Specific Platform enables software or hardware developers to quickly build and run their
specific application or solution. Built for specific markets such as automotive, consumer,
aerospace and defense, communications, audio, video and broadcast, industrial, or scientific and
medical, the Market-Specific Platform integrates both the Base and Domain-Specific Platforms with
higher targeted applications elements such as IP, reference designs and boards optimized for a
particular market.

Design Tools

To accommodate the various design methodologies and design flows employed by the wide range of our
customers’ user profiles such as system designers, algorithm designers, software coders and logic
designers, we provide the appropriate design environment tailored to each user profile for design
creation, design implementation and design verification.

The Xilinx ISE Design Suite features a complete tool chain for the three domain-specific
categories: embedded, DSP and logic/connectivity. To further enhance productivity and help
customers better manage the complexity of their designs, the ISE Design Suite enables designers to
target area, performance, or power by simply selecting a design goal in the setup. In fiscal 2011
we acquired AutoESL Design technologies, Inc (AutoESL), a leading provider of high level C,C++ and
System C synthesis technology to provide a more direct flow in retargeting DSPs and general purpose
processors designs into our FPGAs. The Xilinx ISE Design Suite also interoperates with a wide range
of third-party electronic design automation (EDA) software point-tools offerings.

Intellectual Property

Xilinx and various third parties offer hundreds of no charge and fee-bearing IP core licenses
covering Ethernet, memory controllers and PCIe

®

interface, as well as an abundance of
domain-specific IP in the areas of embedded, DSP and connectivity, as well as market-specific IP
cores. In addition, our products and technology leverage industry standards such as ARM AMBA

®

AXI-4
interconnect technology, IP_XACT and IEEE P1735 encryption to facilitate plug-and-play FPGA design
and take advantage of the large ecosystem of ARM IP developers.



Development Boards, Kits and Configuration Products

In addition to the broad selection of legacy development boards presently offered, we have
introduced a new unified board strategy that enables the creation of a standardized and coordinated
set of base boards available both from Xilinx and our ecosystem partners, all utilizing the
industry-standard extensions that enable customization for market specific applications. Adopting
this standard for all of our base boards enables the creation of a unified, scalable and extensible
delivery mechanism for all Xilinx programmable platforms.

We also offer comprehensive development kits including hardware, design tools, IP and reference
designs that are designed to streamline and accelerate the development of domain-specific and
market-specific applications.

Finally, Xilinx offers a range of configuration products including one-time programmable and
in-system programmable storage devices to configure Xilinx FPGAs. These PROM (programmable
read-only memory) products support all of our FPGA devices.

Third-Party Alliances

Xilinx and certain third parties have developed and continue to offer a robust ecosystem of IP,
boards, tools, services and support through the Xilinx alliance program. Xilinx also works with
these third parties to promote our programmable platforms through third-party tools, IP, software,
boards and design services.

Engineering Services

Xilinx engineering services provide customers with engineering resources to augment their design
teams and to provide expert design-specific advice. Xilinx tailors its engineering services to the
needs of its customers, ranging from hands-on training to full design creation and implementation.

Research and Development

Our research and development (R&D) activities are primarily directed toward the design of new ICs,
the development of new software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software, the
design of logic IP, the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes for ongoing cost
reductions, performance and signal integrity improvements and lowering PLD power consumption. As a
result of our R&D efforts, we have introduced a number of new products during the past several
years including the Virtex-7, Kintex-7, Artix-7, and Zynq 7000. Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families.
Additionally, we have made enhancements to our IP core offerings and introduced new versions of our
ISE Design Suite. We extended our collaboration with our foundry suppliers in the development of
65-nm, 45-nm and 40-nm manufacturing technology and we were the first company in the PLD industry
to ship 45-nm high-volume as well as 28-nm FPGA devices.

Our R&D challenge is to continue to develop new products that create cost-effective solutions for
customers. In fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, our R&D expenses were $392.5 million, $369.5 million and
$355.4 million, respectively. We believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our
future success and are committed to maintaining a significant level of R&D investment.

Sales and Distribution

We sell our products to OEMs and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to
OEMs or contract manufacturers.

We use dedicated global sales and marketing organizations as well as independent sales
representatives to generate sales. In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a
limited number of key accounts with independent sales representatives often serving those customers
in defined territories. Distributors create demand within the balance of our customer base.
Distributors also provide vendor-managed inventory, value-added services and logistics for a wide
range of our OEM customers.

Whether Xilinx, the independent sales representative, or the distributor identifies the sales
opportunity, a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders. In
such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear all legal and
financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, such as credit loss, inventory
shrinkage, theft and foreign currency fluctuations, but excluding indemnity and warranty liability.

In accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted our
authorized distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a
periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a subsequent
change in list prices. Revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred
until the products are sold to the distributors’ end customers.



Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes the substantial majority of our products worldwide. No end
customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. As of April
2, 2011 and April 3, 2010, Avnet accounted for 79% and 83%, respectively, of our total accounts
receivable. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 51%, 49% and 55% of our worldwide net
revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We also use other regional distributors
throughout the world. We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad
range of customers while providing efficient logistics services. Since PLDs are standard products,
they do not present many of the inventory risks to distributors posed by ASICs, and they simplify
the requirements for distributor technical support. From time to time, we may add or terminate
distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct support model as we deem
appropriate given our strategies, the level of distributor business activity and distributor
performance and financial condition. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we
terminated our relationship with one of our North American-based distributors. See “Note 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk” to our consolidated
financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for
information about concentrations of credit risk and “Note 17. Segment Information” for information
about our revenues from external customers and domestic and international operations.

Backlog

As of April 2, 2011, our backlog from OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our
distributors scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $266.0 million, compared to
$282.0 million as of April 3, 2010. Orders from end customers to our distributors are subject to
changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation without significant penalty. As a result,
backlogs from both OEM customers and end customers reported by our distributors as of any
particular period may not be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period.

Wafer Fabrication

As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture wafers used for our IC products or PROMs.
Rather, we purchase wafers from multiple foundries including United Microelectronics Corporation
(UMC), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba),
Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung) and He Jian Technology
(Suzhou) Co., Ltd. Currently, UMC manufactures the substantial majority of our wafers.

Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers
produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations with each wafer
foundry.

Our strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs and software
design tools rather than on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance
foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well as other
suppliers of wafers manufactured with leading-edge process technologies.

Sort, Assembly and Test

Wafers are sorted by the foundry or independent sort subcontractors. Sorted die are assembled by
subcontractors. During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into individual die, which
are then assembled into various package types. Following assembly, the packaged units are
generally tested by Xilinx personnel at our Singapore facility or by independent test
subcontractors. We purchase most of our assembly and some of our test services from Siliconware
Precision Industries Ltd. in Taiwan, Amkor Technology, Inc. in Korea and the Philippines and STATS
ChipPAC Ltd. in Singapore.

Quality Certification

Xilinx has achieved quality management systems certification for ISO 9001:2000 for our facilities
in San Jose, California; Dublin, Ireland; Longmont, Colorado; Singapore and Albuquerque, New
Mexico. In addition, Xilinx achieved ISO 14001 and TL 9000 environmental and quality
certifications in the San Jose, Dublin, Singapore and Albuquerque locations.

Patents and Licenses

While our various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a
whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of
patents or licenses. As of April 2, 2011, we held more than 2,500 issued United States (U.S.)
patents, which vary in duration, and over 600 pending U.S. patent applications relating to our
proprietary technology. We maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the
areas of, but not limited to, circuits, software, IC architecture, IP, system design, testing
methodologies and other technologies relating to our products and business. We have licensed some
parties to certain portions of our patent portfolio and obtained licenses to certain third-party
patents as well.



We have acquired various licenses from third parties to certain technologies that are implemented
in IP or embedded in our PLDs, such as processors. Those licenses support our continuing ability
to make and sell these PLDs to our customers. We also sublicense certain third-party proprietary
software and open-source software, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of those
software components is important to the operation of the design tools upon which customers depend.

We maintain the Xilinx trade name as well as numerous trademarks, and registered trademarks
including Xilinx, the Xilinx logo, Artix, Kintex, Virtex, Spartan, ISE, Zynq and associated logos.
Maintaining these rights, and the goodwill associated with these trademarks and logos, is important
to our business. We also have license rights to use certain trademarks owned by consortiums and
other trademark owners that are related to our products and business.

We intend to continue to protect our IP (including, for example, patents, copyrights and

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should
be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks to the
Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the
Company’s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. If any of
the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and
cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and failure to do so would
have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products that address
customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power
consumption and performance. The success of new product introductions is dependent upon several
factors, including:

•

timely completion of new product designs;

•

ability to generate new design opportunities or design wins;

•

availability of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand
creation and customer adoption of new products;

•

ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies on circuit geometries of
45-nm and smaller;

•

achieving acceptable yields;

•

ability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and
test subcontractors;

•

ability to obtain advanced packaging;

•

availability of supporting software design tools;

•

utilization of predefined IP of logic;

•

customer acceptance of advanced features in our new products; and

•

market acceptance of our customers’ products.

Our product development efforts may not be successful, our new products may not achieve industry
acceptance and we may not achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per
unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the
future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result, we may be increasingly dependent
on revenues derived from design wins for our newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions
in the manufacture of our current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and
corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products, and on introducing new
products that incorporate advanced features and other price/performance factors that enable us to
increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and
new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our products do
not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our financial condition and results of
operations could be materially adversely affected.

We rely on independent foundries for the manufacture of all of our products and a manufacturing
problem or insufficient foundry capacity could adversely affect our operations.

Nearly all of our wafers were manufactured either in Taiwan, by UMC, or in Japan, by Toshiba. In
addition, the wafers for our older products are manufactured in Japan by Seiko and the wafers for
some of our newer products are manufactured in South Korea, by Samsung and in Taiwan, by TSMC.
Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced
by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations between Xilinx and these
wafer foundries, which usually result in short-term agreements that do not provide for long-term
supply or allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries, especially UMC, which
supplies the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on UMC and our other foundries to produce
wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes. Therefore, the foundries must be able to
transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers
at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner. We cannot guarantee that the foundries
that supply our wafers will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the
realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies or difficulties due to limitations of
new and existing process technologies. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee the foundries will be able
to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or continue to manufacture a product for the
full life of the product. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the
financial health and viability of the foundries and result in their insolvency or their inability
to meet their commitments to us. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we experienced
supply shortages due to the difficulties encountered by the foundries when they had to rapidly increase their
production capacities from low utilization levels to high utilization levels because of an
unexpected increase in demand. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and first nine months of fiscal
2011, we also experienced supply shortages due to very strong demand for our products and a surge
in demand for semiconductors in general, which has led to tightening of foundry capacity across the
industry. The insolvency of a foundry or any significant manufacturing problem or insufficient
foundry capacity would disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial condition and
results of operations.

We have established other sources of wafer supply for many of our products in an effort to secure a
continued supply of wafers. However, establishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry
relationships require the investment of management resources as well as additional costs. If we do
not manage these relationships effectively, it could adversely affect our results of operations.



General economic conditions and the related deterioration in the global business environment could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

During the past three years, global consumer confidence eroded amidst concerns over declining asset
values, inflation, volatility in energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of
credit, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial
markets, businesses and sovereign nations, among other concerns. These concerns slowed global
economic
growth and resulted in recessions in numerous countries, including many of those in North America,
Europe and Asia. These economic conditions had a negative impact on our results of operations
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 and the first and second quarters of fiscal
2010 due to reduced customer demand. While there have been recent improvements in global economic
conditions and our results of operations improved during the second half of fiscal 2010 and fiscal
2011, there is no guarantee that these improvements will continue in the future. Recent events have
shown that the financial conditions of sovereign nations, particularly in Europe, are of
continuing concern. If unpredictable economic conditions persist or worsen, a number of negative
effects on our business could result, including customers or potential customers reducing or
delaying orders, the insolvency of key suppliers, which could result in production delays, the
inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these
effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables and
ultimately decrease our net revenues and profitability.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by cyclical market patterns and a significant industry
downturn could adversely affect our operating results.

The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and our financial performance has been affected by
downturns in the industry. Down cycles are generally characterized by price erosion and weaker
demand for our products. Weaker demand for our products resulting from economic conditions in the
end markets we serve and reduced capital spending by our customers can result, and in the past has
resulted in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory write-downs. We attempt to
identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market in
which we operate make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and
other factors, our past results are not reliable predictors of our future results.

The nature of our business makes our revenues difficult to predict which could have an adverse
impact on our business.

In addition to the challenging market conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the
demand for our products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends upon
our products being designed into our end customers’ products and those products achieving market
acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers’ designs, the design to volume production
process for our customers requires a substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In
addition, we are dependent upon “turns” (orders received and turned for shipment in the same
quarter). These factors make it difficult for us to forecast future sales and project quarterly
revenues. The difficulty in forecasting future sales impairs our ability to project our inventory
requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted, in inventory write-downs or failure
to timely meet customer product demands. In addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues
compromises our ability to provide forward-looking revenue and earnings guidance.

If we are not able to successfully compete in our industry, our financial results and future
prospects will be adversely affected.

Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and
characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence
and continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD competitors,
Altera, Lattice and Microsemi (which acquired Actel Corporation during the third quarter of fiscal
2011), and from new market entrants. In addition, competition from the ASIC market and from the
ASSP market continues. We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry
include:

•

product pricing;

•

time-to-market;

•

product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density;

•

field upgradeability;

•

adaptability of products to specific applications;

•

ease of use and functionality of software design tools;

•

availability and functionality of predefined IP of logic;

•

inventory and supply chain management;

•

access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity; and

•

ability to provide timely customer service and support.

Our strategy for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction of new product
architectures that address high-volume, low-cost and low-power applications as well as
high-performance, high-density applications. In addition, we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our customers to reduce prices, which may outpace
our ability to lower the cost for established products. However, we may not be
successful in executing these strategies.



Other competitors include manufacturers of:

•

high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;

•

high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;

•

ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic;

•

high-speed, low-density complex programmable logic devices;

•

high-performance DSP devices;

•

products with embedded processors;

•

products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; and

•

other new or emerging programmable logic products.

Several companies have introduced products that compete with ours or have announced their intention
to sell PLD products. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our financial
condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of competitors to this segment. We
recognize that different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are
developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs. Recognizing
the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have developed common software design
tools that support the full range of our IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design
are significant competitive factors in this segment.

We could also face competition from our licensees. In the past we have granted limited rights to
other companies with respect to certain of our older technology, and we may do so in the future.
Granting such rights may enable these companies to manufacture and market products that may be
competitive with some of our older products.

Recent events in Japan may adversely impact our business.

In March 2011, the northern region of Japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a tsunami
and nuclear plant shutdown. These events caused significant damages in that region and have
adversely affected Japan’s infrastructure and economy. While Japan is a resilient country, and we
expect Japan to recover from this devastation, it is unknown when such recovery will occur.

Certain of our foundries and manufacturing plants in our supply chain are located in Japan and were
negatively impacted by the natural disasters, particularly as a result of disruptions to the
country’s power supply. For example, certain suppliers of wafers and substrates were temporarily
forced to halt production. While we have secured alternate sources for these materials, there can
be no assurance that we will not experience the absence of components or supplies, delays in
obtaining their delivery or increases in prices in the future as the impact of the natural
disasters in Japan unfolds.

In addition, a number of our customers are located in Japan, which accounted for 8% of our
revenue in fiscal 2011. As a result of the earthquake, we were temporarily unable to ship product
to customers located in the areas impacted by the natural disaster. Other customers not located
near the epicenter of the earthquake may also be affected by the consequences of these natural
disasters. If adverse conditions persist, we may experience delay or cancellation of orders from
such customers, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.

In addition, a nuclear power plant in the region was damaged and released radiation into the
atmosphere. The impact of this radiation is unknown at this time. If the consequences of the
radiation are more severe than currently anticipated, our customers and suppliers may be affected.
Any significant disruption of our suppliers’ and customers’ business in Japan could have an adverse
impact on our business.

Increased costs of wafers and materials, or shortages in wafers and materials, could adversely
impact our gross margins and lead to reduced revenues.

If greater demand for wafers is not offset by an increase in foundry capacity, or market demand for
wafers or production and assembly materials increases, or if a supplier of our wafers ceases or
suspends operations, our supply of wafers and other materials
could become limited. Such shortages raise the likelihood of potential wafer price increases and
wafer shortages or shortages in materials at production and test facilities and our resulting
potential inability to address customer product demands in a timely manner. For example, as a
result of the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, certain suppliers were forced to temporarily halt
production, resulting in a tightening of supply for those materials. Such shortages of wafers and
materials as well as increases in wafer prices or materials could adversely affect our gross
margins and would adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands and lead to reduced
revenue.



We depend on distributors, primarily Avnet, to generate a majority of our sales and complete order
fulfillment.

Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 51% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2011, and
as of April 2, 2011, Avnet accounted for 79% of our total accounts receivable. To align with our
strategic initiative to consolidate our distribution channel, we have further strengthened our
partnership with Avnet and recently, Avnet committed more personnel and resources to our business.
In return for these long-term commitments, we agreed to temporarily extend payment terms for Avnet,
which increased our trade accounts receivable balance and days sales outstanding (DSO) as of the
end of our second and third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to our historical level. Our trade
accounts receivable balance and DSO levels specific to Avnet decreased in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2011 when Avnet returned to standard payment terms. Any adverse change to our relationship
with Avnet or our remaining distributors could have a material impact on our business. Furthermore,
if a key distributor materially defaults on a contract or otherwise fails to perform, our business
and financial results would suffer. In addition, we are subject to concentrations of credit risk in
our trade accounts receivable, which includes accounts of our distributors. A significant reduction
of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our relationship with one
or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely affect our
ability to sell our products.

In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them
are important to our success. Unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial
health of some of these distributors, particularly our smaller distributors. This could result in
the insolvency of certain distributors, the inability of distributors to obtain credit to finance
the purchase of our products, or cause distributors to delay payment of their obligations to us and
increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial health of these
distributors impairs their performance and we are unable to secure alternate distributors.

We are dependent on independent subcontractors for most of our assembly and test services, and
unavailability or disruption of these services could negatively impact our financial condition and
results of operations.

We are also dependent on subcontractors to provide semiconductor assembly, substrate, test and
shipment services. Any prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost
attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, any disruption in assembly, test or shipment
services, or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply,
could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands.
In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and
viability of these subcontractors and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their
commitments to us. These factors would result in reduced net revenues and could negatively impact
our financial condition and results of operations.

A number of factors, including our inventory strategy, can impact our gross margins.

A number of factors, including yield, wafer pricing, product mix, market acceptance of our new
products, competitive pricing dynamics, geographic and/or market segment pricing strategies cause
our gross margins to fluctuate. In addition, forecasting our gross margins is difficult because a
significant portion of our business is based on turns within the same quarter.

Our current inventory levels are higher than historical norms due to our decision to build
incremental safety stock and to build ahead of a planned closure of a particular foundry process
line at one of our foundry partners. In the event demand does not materialize, we may be subject
to incremental obsolescence costs. In addition, future product cost reductions could have an increased impact on our inventory
valuation, which would then impact our operating results.

Reductions in the average selling prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross
margins.

The average selling prices of our products generally decline as the products mature. We seek to
offset the decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost reductions and
increased unit sales. We also continue to develop higher value products or product features that
increase, or slow the decline of, the average selling price of our products. However, there is no
guarantee that our ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline
in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in revenues and have a
negative effect on our gross margins.

Because of our international business and operations, we are vulnerable to the economic conditions
of the countries in which we operate and currency fluctuations could have a material adverse affect
on our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to our U.S. operations, we also have significant international operations, including
foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors, our regional
headquarters in Ireland and Singapore and a research and development site in India. In connection
with the restructuring we announced in April 2009, our international operations grew as we
relocated certain operations and administrative functions outside the U.S. Sales and operations
outside of the U.S. subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic
and regulatory environments. Our financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant
business or by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries. We derive over
one-half of our revenues from international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and
Japan. Past economic weakness in these markets adversely affected revenues. While there have been
signs of economic recovery in the U.S. and other markets, there can be no assurance that such
improvement will continue or is sustainable. Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are
denominated in U.S. dollars. While the recent movement of the Euro and Yen against the U.S. dollar
had no material impact to our business, increased volatility could impact our European and Japanese
customers. Currency instability and volatility and disruptions in the credit and capital markets
may increase credit risks for some of our customers and may impair our customers’ ability to repay
existing obligations. Increased currency volatility could also positively or negatively impact our
foreign-currency-denominated costs, assets and liabilities. In addition, devaluation of the U.S.
dollar relative to other foreign currencies may increase the operating expenses of our foreign
subsidiaries adversely affecting our results of operations. Furthermore, because we are
increasingly dependent on the global economy, instability in worldwide economic environments
occasioned, for example, by political instability, terrorist activity or U.S. or other military
actions could adversely impact economic activity and lead to a contraction of capital spending by
our customers. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations in the future.



We are subject to the risks associated with conducting business operations outside of the U.S.
which could adversely affect our business.

In addition to international sales and support operations and development activities, we purchase
our wafers from foreign foundries and have our commercial products assembled, packaged and tested
by subcontractors located outside the U.S. All of these activities are subject to the uncertainties
associated with international business operations, including tax laws and regulations, trade
barriers, economic sanctions, import and export regulations, duties and tariffs and other trade
restrictions, changes in trade policies, foreign governmental regulations, potential vulnerability
of and reduced protection for IP, longer receivable collection periods and disruptions or delays in
production or shipments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and/or operating results. Additional factors that could adversely affect us due
to our international operations include rising oil prices and increased costs of natural resources.
Moreover, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of
political conflicts or economic crises in countries where our main wafer providers, end customers
and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and test services worldwide, are located. Adverse
change to the circumstances or conditions of our international business operations could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in credit rating and in the market
values of our portfolio investments which could have a material adverse impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.

Our cash, short-term and long-term investments represent significant assets that may be subject to
fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements, changes in credit
rating and financial market conditions. Since September 2007, the global credit markets have
experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the values of various types of
investment and non-investment grade securities. During this time, the global credit and capital
markets have experienced significant volatility and disruption due to instability in the global
financial system, uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding
sovereign financial stability.

While general conditions in the global credit markets have improved, there is a risk that we may
incur other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market
conditions deteriorate or the underlying assets fail to perform as anticipated. Our future
investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline
in fair values of our debt securities is judged to be other than temporary. Furthermore, we may
suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value
due to changes in interest rates or financial market conditions.

Our failure to protect and defend our intellectual property could impair our ability to compete
effectively.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trade secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our
intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that such intellectual property rights can be
successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, violated, circumvented or
challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have asserted against us
patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us.
Third parties may attempt to misappropriate our IP through electronic or other means or assert
infringement claims against our indemnitees or us in the future. Such assertions by third parties
may result in costly litigation, indemnity claims or other legal actions, and we may not prevail in
such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on
commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our ability to import and sell our
products. Any infringement claim, indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our
intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

We rely on information technology systems, and failure of these systems to function properly or
unauthorized access to our systems could result in business disruption.

We rely in part on various information technology (IT) systems to manage our operations, including
financial reporting, and we regularly evaluate these systems and make changes to improve them as
necessary. Consequently, we periodically implement new, or enhance existing, operational and IT
systems, procedures and controls. For example, in the past we simplified our supply chain and were
required to make certain changes to our IT systems. Any delay in the implementation of, or
disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our
ability to record and report financial and management information on a
timely and accurate basis. These systems are also subject to power and telecommunication outages or
other general system failures. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could
result in business disruption. We also may be subject to unauthorized access to our IT systems
through a security breach or attack. We seek to detect and investigate any security incidents and
prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude
and effects. Our business could be significantly harmed and we could be subject to third party
claims in the event of such a security breach.

Earthquakes and other natural disasters could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse
affect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California
and Singapore facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural
disasters. UMC’s foundries in Taiwan and Toshiba’s and Seiko’s foundries in Japan as well as many
of our operations in California are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the
recent past and some areas have been affected by other natural disasters such as typhoons. Any
catastrophic event in these locations will disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing
activities and our insurance may not cover losses resulting from such disruptions of our
operations. Furthermore, this type of disruption could result in our inability to manufacture or
ship products, thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of
operations. For example, as a result of the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, production at the
Seiko foundry at Sakata was halted temporarily, impacting production of some of our older devices.
In addition, suppliers of wafers and substrates were forced to halt production temporarily.
Disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason, including other natural disasters such
as typhoons, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, fires or floods, as well as disruptions in access to
adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our
products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.



If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, our stock price could be adversely
affected.

We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 (the Act). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with the Act may not operate
effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness disclosure. The identification of
material weaknesses in internal control, if any, could indicate a lack of proper controls to
generate accurate financial statements and could cause investors to lose confidence and our stock
price to drop.

We compete with others to attract and retain key personnel, and any loss of, or inability to
attract, such personnel would harm us.

We depend on the efforts and abilities of certain key members of management and other technical
personnel. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to retain such personnel and
attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, particularly product engineers. Competition
for such personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining new or existing
qualified personnel. From time to time we have effected restructurings which eliminate a number of
positions. Even if such personnel are not directly affected by the restructuring effort, such
terminations can have a negative impact on morale and our ability to attract and hire new qualified
personnel in the future. If we lose existing qualified personnel or are unable to hire new
qualified personnel, as needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be seriously harmed.

Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and
operating results.

From time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the
ordinary conduct of our business. Certain claims are not yet resolved, including those that are
discussed under Item 1. “Legal Proceedings,” included in Part II, and additional claims may arise
in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its
merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant
expense and diversion of management attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid
these risks. Should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be
resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages
or injunctive relief against us that would materially and adversely affect a portion of our
business and might materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

Our products could have defects which could result in reduced revenues and claims against us.

We develop complex and evolving products that include both hardware and software. Despite our
testing efforts and those of our subcontractors, defects may be found in existing or new products.
These defects may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs,
divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our
relationships with customers. Subject to certain terms and conditions, we have agreed to compensate
certain customers for limited specified costs they actually incur in the event our hardware
products experience epidemic failure. As a result, epidemic failure and other performance problems
could result in claims against us, the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would
likely harm our business. Our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses.

In addition, we could be subject to product liability claims. A product liability claim brought
against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend. Product
liability risks are particularly significant with respect to aerospace, automotive and medical
applications because of the risk of serious harm to users of these products. Any product liability
claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the
efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business.

In preparing our financial statements, we make good faith estimates and judgments that may change
or turn out to be erroneous.

In preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the U.S., we must make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical accounting
policies. Those estimates and judgments have a significant impact on the results we report in our
consolidated financial statements. The most difficult estimates and subjective judgments that we
make concern valuation of marketable and non-marketable securities, revenue recognition,
inventories, long-lived assets including acquisition-related intangibles, goodwill, taxes and
stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, input from outside
experts and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We also have other key accounting
policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make
estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our
financial reporting. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. If these estimates
or their related assumptions change, our operating results for the periods in which we revise our
estimates or assumptions could be adversely and perhaps materially affected.



Our failure to comply with the requirements of the International Traffic and Arms Regulations could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Certain Xilinx space-grade FPGAs and related technologies are subject to the International Traffic
in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered by the U.S. Department of State. The ITAR
governs the export and reexport of these FPGAs, the transfer of related technical data and the
provision of defense services, as well as offshore production, test and assembly. We are required
to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet ITAR requirements.

An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when they will be granted,
increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. In addition, security or compliance program
failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent ITAR
licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

Considerable amounts of our common shares are available for issuance under our equity incentive
plans and convertible debentures, and significant issuances in the future may adversely impact the
market price of our common shares.

As of April 2, 2011, we had 2.00 billion authorized common shares, of which 264.6 million shares
were outstanding. In addition, 49.7 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to
our equity incentive plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 42.7 million common shares were
reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible debentures and 19.8 million
common shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of warrants. The availability of substantial
amounts of our common shares resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding
under our equity incentive plans or the conversion or repurchase of convertible debentures using
common shares, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders, could adversely affect the
prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional
capital through the sale of equity securities.

We have indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from
fulfilling our debt obligations.

The aggregate principal amount of our consolidated indebtedness as of April 2, 2011 was $1.29
billion (principal amount). We also may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our
indebtedness may:

•

make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making
scheduled principal and interest payments on the debentures and our other indebtedness;

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;

•

require us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service
payments;

•

limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors;

•

increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions;
and

•

require us to repatriate off-shore cash to the U.S. at unfavorable tax rates.

Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will
be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are
beyond our control.

The call options and warrant transactions related to our 2.625% Senior Convertible Debentures due
June 15, 2017 (2.625% Debentures) may affect the value of the debentures and our common stock.

To hedge against potential dilution upon conversion of the 2.625% Debentures, we purchased call
options on our common stock from the hedge counterparties. We also sold warrants to the hedge
counterparties, which could separately have a dilutive effect on our
earnings per share to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the
applicable strike price of the warrants of $42.91 per share.

As the hedge counterparties and their respective affiliates modify hedge positions, they may enter
or unwind various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchase or sell our common
stock in secondary market transactions. This activity also could affect the market price of our
common stock and/or debentures, which could affect the ability of the holders of the debentures to
convert and the number of shares and value of the consideration that will be received by the
holders of the debentures upon conversion.

The conditional conversion features of the outstanding debentures, if triggered, may adversely
affect our financial condition and operating results.

Our outstanding debentures have conditional conversion features. In the event the conditional
conversion features of the debentures are triggered, holders of such debentures will be entitled to
convert the debentures at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders
elect to convert their debentures, we would be required to settle any converted principal through
the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Even if holders do not elect to
convert their debentures, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all
or a portion of the outstanding principal of the debentures as a current rather than long-term
liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. In addition, we
could be required to increase the number of shares used in our per share calculations to reflect
the potentially dilutive impact of the conversion.



Acquisitions and strategic investments present risks, and we may not realize the goals that were
contemplated at the time of a transaction.

We recently acquired technology companies whose products complement our products, and in the past
we have made a number of strategic investments in other technology companies. We may make similar
acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. Acquisitions and strategic investments
present risks, including:

•

our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted
by investment, acquisition, transition or integration activities;

•

an acquisition or strategic investment may not further our business strategy as we
expected, and we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as
we expected;

•

our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claims or
liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise
related to an acquisition;

•

we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies or products with our
existing product lines;

•

we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of
acquired products, in general and administrative functions that support such products;

•

our strategic investments may not perform as expected; and

•

we may experience unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our
acquisitions and strategic investments pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition
or several concurrent acquisitions or strategic investments.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Patent Litigation

On December 28, 2007, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG (PACT)
against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division (PACT
XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No. 2:07-CV-563). The lawsuit pertains
to eleven different patents and PACT seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages, interest and
attorneys’ fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to us is
estimable at this time.

On July 30, 2010, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by Intellitech Corporation (Intellitech)
against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Intellitech Corporation v.
Altera Corporation, Xilinx, Inc. and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation Case No. 1:10-CV-00645-UNA).
The lawsuit pertains to a single patent and Intellitech seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,
unspecified damages, interest and attorneys’ fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any
potential exposure to us is estimable at this time.

On February 15, 2011, we filed a lawsuit against Intellitech in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California (Xilinx, Inc. v. Intellitech Corporation, Case No. CV11-0699). The
lawsuit pertains to seven patents and a single trademark and we seek declaratory and injunctive
relief, unspecified damages, costs and attorneys’ fees.

On December 6, 2010, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by Bala Delay Line, Inc. (Bala
Delay) against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Texarkana Division
(Bala Delay Line, Inc V. Xilinx, Inc., Case No. 5:10-CV-211) (Bala Delay I), and on January 31,
2011, Bala Delay filed another patent infringement lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division (Bala Delay Line, Inc v. Xilinx, Inc. and
Bonser-Philhower Sales, Inc., Case No. 4:11-CV-46) (Balay Delay II). Both lawsuits pertained to
the same single patent and in each case Bala Delay sought declaratory and injunctive relief,
unspecified damages, interest and attorneys’ fees. We have successfully resolved both lawsuits.
Bala Delay I was dismissed by the Court without prejudice on March 7, 2011 and Bala Delay II was
dismissed by the Court without prejudice on March 18, 2011. In both cases, Bala Delay stipulated
that it has no present intent to initiate litigation against any Xilinx product based on the
patent, and subsequent litigation would be brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California. No settlement was reached and no payment was made by us to Bala Delay in
connection with either dismissal.

On February 14, 2011, we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against Intellectual Ventures
Management LLC and related entities (Intellectual Ventures) in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California (Xilinx, Inc. v. Invention Investment Fund I LP, Invention
Investment Fund II LLC, Intellectual Ventures LLC, Intellectual Ventures Management LLC,
Intellectual Ventures I LLC and Intellectual Ventures II LLC, Case No. CV11-0671). The lawsuit
pertains to sixteen patents and seeks judgments of non-infringement by Xilinx and judgments that
the patents are invalid and unenforceable, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees.

On February 15, 2011, Intellectual Ventures added us as a defendant in its complaint for patent
infringement previously filed against Altera, Microsemi and Lattice in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Delaware (Intellectual Ventures I LLC and Intellectual Ventures II LLC v. Altera
Corporation, Microsemi Corporation, Lattice Semiconductor Corporation and Xilinx, Inc., Case No.
10-CV-1065). The lawsuit pertains to five patents, four of which we are alleged to be infringing,
and Intellectual Ventures seeks unspecified damages, interest and attorneys’ fees. Neither the
likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to us is estimable at this time.

We intend to continue to protect and defend our IP vigorously.

Other Matters

From time to time, we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the
ordinary course of our business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual
property, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, tax, regulatory, distribution
arrangements, employee relations and other matters. Periodically, we review the status of each
matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal
proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, we accrue a
liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes
are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best
information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we continue to
reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise estimates.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8.
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Cautionary Statement

The statements in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis that are forward-looking, within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and
uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including those risks discussed under “Risk
Factors” and elsewhere in this document. Often, forward-looking statements can be identified by
the use of forward-looking words, such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “believe,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “continue,” “plan,” “intend,” “project” and other similar terminology, or
the negative of such terms. We disclaim any responsibility to update or revise any forward-looking
statement provided in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for any reason.

Nature of Operations

We design, develop and market programmable platforms, including advanced ICs in the form of PLDs,
software design tools and predefined system functions delivered as IP. In addition to our
programmable platforms, we provide design services, customer training, field engineering and
technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs,  CPLDs and EPPs. These devices are standard products that our
customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our products are designed to provide high
integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets such as
wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, aerospace and defense,
audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing. We sell our products
globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to OEMs by
a network of independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management organization.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have
a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC
has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and
subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are
inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, our critical accounting policies include:
valuation of marketable and non-marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity
securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of
revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of revenues and gross margin. Our
critical accounting policies also include: the assessment of impairment of long-lived assets
including acquisition-related intangibles, which impacts their valuation; the assessment of the
recoverability of goodwill, which impacts goodwill impairment; accounting for income taxes, which
impacts the provision or benefit recognized for income taxes, as well as the valuation of deferred
tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet; and valuation and recognition of stock-based
compensation, which impacts gross margin, research and development (R&D) expenses, and selling,
general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as
the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as
subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make estimates or judgments
that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting.

Valuation of Marketable and Non-marketable Securities

Our short-term and long-term investments include marketable debt securities and non-marketable
equity securities. As of April 2, 2011, we had marketable debt securities with a fair value of
$2.33 billion and non-marketable equity securities in private companies of $11.4 million (adjusted
cost, which approximates fair value).

We determine the fair values for marketable debt and equity securities using industry standard
pricing services, data providers and other third-party sources and by internally performing
valuation analyses. See “Note 3. Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial
statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for details of the
valuation methodologies. In determining if and when a decline in value below adjusted cost of
marketable debt and equity securities is other than temporary, we evaluate on an ongoing basis the
market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition, credit ratings, any underlying
collateral and other key measures for our investments. We recorded an other-than-temporary
impairment for marketable debt securities and a marketable equity security in fiscal 2009. We did
not record any other-than-temporary impairment for marketable debt or equity securities in fiscal
2011 or 2010.



Our investments in non-marketable securities of private companies are accounted for by using the
cost method. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when they are
deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In determining whether a decline in value of
non-marketable equity investments in private companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an
assessment is made by considering available evidence, including the general market conditions in
the investee’s industry, the investee’s product development status and subsequent rounds of
financing and the related valuation and/or our participation in such financings. We also assess
the investee’s ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash,
the investee’s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to
purchase the investee from a prospective acquirer. The valuation methodology for determining the
fair value of non-marketable equity securities is based on the factors noted above which require
management judgment and are Level 3 inputs. See “Note 3. Fair Value Measurements” to our
consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data,” for additional information. When a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary,
we recognize an impairment loss in the current period’s operating results to the extent of the
decline. We recorded other-than-temporary impairments for non-marketable equity securities in
fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 of $5.9 million, $3.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights
of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are
deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors’ end customers. For
fiscal 2011, approximately 63% of our net revenues were from products sold to distributors for
subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on
notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the distributor’s end customer.
Also reported by the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment
information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on hand is reconciled to
deferred revenue balances monthly. We maintain system controls to validate distributor data and to
verify that the reported information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors
reflects the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin expected to be
realized when distributors sell through product purchased from us. Accounts receivable from
distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfers,
typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to
collection under normal payment terms.

As of April 2, 2011, we had $134.0 million of deferred revenue and $34.2 million of deferred cost
of revenues recognized as a net $99.8 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. As
of April 3, 2010, we had $110.4 million of deferred revenue and $30.3 million of deferred cost of
revenues recognized as a net $80.1 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. The
deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our consolidated
statement of income will be different than the amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet due
to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors when the product is sold to their end
customers.

Revenue from sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive
evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of
resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance requirements and
no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there were no significant
formal acceptance provisions with our direct customers.

Revenue from software licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses
of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed. Revenue
from Support Products, which includes software and services sales, was less than 6% of net revenues
for all of the periods presented.

Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known
pending customer returns or allowances.

Valuation of Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out
method) or market (estimated net realizable value). The valuation of inventory requires us to
estimate excess or obsolete inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We
review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. Our
manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of
actual spending over actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the cyclicality of the
market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, we write down inventory based on
forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and
economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic
direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future
demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts,
which are also consistent with our short-term manufacturing plans. If our demand forecast for
specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output
accordingly, we could be required to write down additional inventory, which would have a negative
impact on our gross margin.



Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquisition-Related Intangibles

Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for
impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a
quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate
future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not
expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down
to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to
the assets or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the
ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows.

When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the
excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Factors affecting impairment of
assets held for sale include market conditions. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate
impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale.

Long-lived assets such as acquisition-related intangible assets and property, plant and equipment,
are considered non-financial assets, and are only measured at fair value when indicators of
impairment exist. The accounting and disclosure guidance for fair value measurements established
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) became effective for these assets beginning in
the first quarter of fiscal 2010. See “Note 3. Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated
financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for
additional information.

Goodwill

As required by the authoritative guidance for goodwill established by the FASB, goodwill is not
amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators
of potential impairment exist, and goodwill is written down when it is determined to be impaired.
We perform an annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and compare the
fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the
carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired.
For purposes of impairment testing, Xilinx operates as a single reporting unit. We use the quoted
market price method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Based on the impairment
review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, there was no impairment of goodwill in
fiscal 2011. Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for goodwill
will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. To date, no impairment
indicators have been identified.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Xilinx is a multinational corporation operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. We must determine
the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions and
apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. We undergo routine audits by taxing
authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among
various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often require an extended period of time to resolve and may
result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions
with different tax rates.

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and
judgments. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and
in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from
temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.
Additionally, we must estimate the amount and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or
deficiency notices issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities’ positions and our
assessment can change over time resulting in a material effect on the provision for income taxes in
periods when these changes occur.

We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If
recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve in the form
of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be
recoverable.

We perform a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions relating to
accounting for income taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the
position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation
processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is
more than 50% likely of being ultimately realized. See “Note 16. Income Taxes” to our consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”



Stock-Based Compensation

Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards
at the date of grant requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate
the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under our Employee Stock
Purchase Plan. Option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model, also require
the use of input assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected
dividend rate, expected forfeiture rate and expected risk-free rate of return. We use implied
volatility based on traded options in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more
reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical
volatility. In determining the appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered: the volume of
market activity of traded options, and determined there was sufficient market activity; the ability
to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those of options granted by us, such
as date of grant and the exercise price, and determined the input assumptions were comparable; and
the length of term of traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally one to
two years and which was extrapolated to match the expected term of the employee options granted by
us, and determined the length of the option term was reasonable. The expected life of options
granted is based on the historical exercise activity as well as the expected disposition of all
options outstanding. We will continue to review our input assumptions and make changes as deemed
appropriate depending on new information that becomes available. Higher volatility and expected
lives result in a proportional increase to stock-based compensation determined at the date of
grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return do not have as significant
an effect on the calculation of fair value.

In addition, we developed an estimate of the number of stock-based awards which will be forfeited
due to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate have an effect on
reported stock-based compensation, as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization
after April 1, 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual
forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to
increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized
in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture
rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an
increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. The impact of forfeiture true up
and forfeiture rate estimates in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 reduced stock-based compensation
expense by $14.1 million, $16.7 million and $15.8 million, respectively. The expense we recognize
in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and/or our forecasts due
to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates.

Net revenues in fiscal 2011 increased 29% to $2.37 billion, up from $1.83 billion in fiscal 2010.
The significant year-over-year increase was driven by strong New Product growth and broad based
strength across all of our end markets and geographies. Total unit sales increased in fiscal 2011
versus the comparable prior year period. The average selling price per unit also increased during
the same time period. Net revenues in fiscal 2010 were essentially flat with fiscal 2009 as the
first half of fiscal 2010 revenues was adversely impacted by economic conditions and was
substantially lower than revenues in the prior year period, while the second half was substantially
higher than revenues in the prior year period. New Product revenues increased considerably in
fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period but were offset by declines in Mainstream, Base
and Support Products. In fiscal 2010, total unit sales declined and the average selling price per
unit increased versus the comparable prior year period. See “Net Revenues by Product” and “Net
Revenues by End Markets” below for more information on our product and end-market categories.

No end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented.

Net Revenues by Product

We sell our products to global manufacturers of electronic products in end markets such as wired
and wireless communications, aerospace and defense, industrial, scientific and medical and audio,
video and broadcast. The vast majority of our net revenues are generated by sales of our
semiconductor products, but we also generate sales from support products. We classify our product
offerings into four categories: New, Mainstream, Base and Support Products. The composition of
each product category is as follows:

•

New Products include our most recent product offerings and include the
Virtex

®

-6, Virtex-5, Spartan

®

-6, Spartan-3A and Spartan-3E product
families.

•

Mainstream Products include the Virtex-4, Spartan-3, Spartan-II and CoolRunner™-II
product families.

•

Base Products consist of our older product families including the Virtex, Virtex-E,
Virtex-II, Spartan, XC4000, CoolRunner and XC9500 products.

•

Support Products include configuration products (PROMs), software, IP, customer
training, design services and support.

These product categories, except for Support Products, are modified on a periodic basis to better
reflect the age of the products and advances in technology. The most recent modification was made
on March 29, 2009, which was the beginning of our fiscal 2010. Amounts for the prior periods
presented have been reclassified to conform to the new categorization. New Products include our
most recent product offerings and are typically designed into our customers’ latest generation of
electronic systems. Mainstream Products are generally several years old and designed into customer
programs that are currently shipping in full production. Base Products are older than Mainstream
Products with demand generated generally by the customers’ oldest systems still in production.
Support Products are generally products or services sold in conjunction with our semiconductor
devices to aid customers in the design process.

Net revenues from New Products increased significantly in fiscal 2011 as a result of continued
strong market acceptance of these products, particularly for our 65-nanometer (nm) Virtex-5, 40-nm
Virtex-6 and 45-nm Spartan-6 product families. We expect sales
of New Products to continue to increase over time as more customer programs enter volume production
with our 40/45-nm products. In fiscal 2010, Virtex-5 contributed to the majority of the revenue
growth versus the comparable prior year period.

Net revenues from Mainstream Products increased in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased sales of
our Virtex-4 product family. Net revenues from Mainstream Products declined in fiscal 2010 due to
lower demand associated with the weakened economic conditions during the first half of the fiscal
year.



Net revenues from Base Products increased in fiscal 2011 from the comparable prior year period
primarily due to last time buying activities for some of our oldest products. The decline in net
revenues from Base Products in fiscal 2010, as compared to the prior year period, was due to lower
sales from some of our oldest products and was expected since these products are mature and
approaching the end of life.

Net revenues from Support Products increased in fiscal 2011 from the comparable prior year period
primarily due to higher sales in our PROM products. Net revenues from Support Products decreased
in fiscal 2010 from the comparable prior year period due to a decline in revenues from both our
PROMs and software products.

Net Revenues by End Markets

Our end market revenue data is derived from our understanding of our end customers’ primary
markets. We classify our net revenues by end markets into four categories: Communications,
Industrial and Other, Consumer and Automotive, and Data Processing. The percentage change
calculation in the table below represents the year-to-year dollar change in each end market.

In fiscal 2011, sales from each of our end markets increased double digits versus the comparable
prior year period.

Net revenues from Communications, our largest end market, increased from the comparable prior year
period due to higher sales from both wired and wireless communication applications. In fiscal
2010, higher sales from wireless communication applications drove the increase in net revenues
versus the comparable prior year period.

Net revenues from the Industrial and Other end market increased in fiscal 2011 from the comparable
prior year period primarily due to higher sales in industrial, scientific and medical as well as
test and measurement applications. In fiscal 2010, the decrease in net revenues from the
comparable prior year period was primarily driven by weaker sales in industrial, scientific and
medical applications as well as test and measurement applications during the first half of the
fiscal year.

Net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market increased in fiscal 2011 from the
comparable prior year period primarily due to higher sales in audio, video and broadcast
applications. Net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market decreased in fiscal 2010
from the comparable prior year period primarily due to decreased sales in audio, video and
broadcast and consumer applications.

In fiscal 2011, net revenues from the Data Processing end market increased from the comparable
prior year period due to higher sales from computing, data processing and storage applications. In
fiscal 2010, net revenues from the Data Processing end market declined from the comparable prior
year period due to a decrease in sales from computing and data processing applications.

Net Revenues by Geography

In fiscal 2011, sales from each of our geographies increased double digits versus the comparable
prior year period.



North America net revenues increased in fiscal 2011 from the comparable prior year period due to
broad-based strength across all end markets, with particular strength coming from the Industrial
and Other end market. Net revenues in North America were essentially flat in fiscal 2010 compared
with the prior year period, as lower sales from the Consumer and Automotive end market offset
strength in each of the other end markets including Communications, Industrial and Other and Data
Processing.

Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased in fiscal 2011 from the comparable prior year period
primarily due to higher sales in the Communications end market with increases in sales from both
wired and wireless communications applications. The increase in fiscal 2010, as compared to the
prior year period, was primarily driven by strength in the Communications end market, which
experienced strong sales growth associated with the deployment of next generation wireless
applications in China.

Net revenues in Europe increased in fiscal 2011 from the comparable prior year period driven by
broad-based strength across all end market segments and all sub segments with particular strength
coming from the Communications end market primarily due to higher sales from wireless
communications applications. Net revenues in Europe decreased in fiscal 2010, as compared to the
prior year period, due to weaker sales in most end market applications with the exception of
wireless communication and automotive applications.

The fiscal 2011 increase in net revenues in Japan was primarily driven by higher sales in the
Industrial and Other and Consumer end market segments. Net revenues in Japan decreased in fiscal
2010 due to broad-based weakness across all end market categories.

The increase in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2011 from the comparable prior year period
was driven primarily by a broad improvement in product costs and higher revenue. This improvement
was partly offset by the growth of New Products. New Products generally have lower gross margins
than Mainstream and Base Products as they are in the early stage of their product life cycle and
have higher unit costs associated with relatively lower volumes and early manufacturing maturity.

Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2010 was essentially flat from the comparable prior year period
as cost savings related to yield improvement and overall restructuring effort were offset by the
strength of New Products.

Gross margin may be affected in the future by product mix shifts, competitive-pricing pressure,
manufacturing-yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate any adverse impacts from these
factors by continuing to improve yields on our New Products and by improving manufacturing
efficiencies.

Sales of inventory previously written off were not material during fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.

In order to compete effectively, we pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the
form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is
common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product
architecture and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost. We
have historically been able to offset much of this revenue decline in our mature products with
increased revenues from newer products.

R&D spending increased $23.0 million or 6% during fiscal 2011 compared to the same period last

such as incentive compensation expenses associated with higher revenue and operating margin, and
higher overall headcount.

R&D spending increased $14.1 million or 4% during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase
was mainly due to increased mask and wafer spending in fiscal 2010 associated with the introduction
of Virtex 6 and Spartan 6 product families.

We plan to continue to selectively invest in R&D efforts in areas such as new products and more
advanced process development, IP and the development of new design and layout software. We will
also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for technology leadership and engineering
resources in critical areas.

and operating margin, particularly sales commissions and incentive compensation expenses, and
higher legal expenses related to litigations and acquisitions.

SG&A expenses decreased $16.2 million or 5% during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period last
year. The decrease was primarily due to headcount reduction as a result of restructuring measures
taken during fiscal 2010, partially offset by higher litigation related costs.

Amortization expense in fiscal 2011 was related to the intangible assets acquired in the fourth

statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Amortization expense
in fiscal 2010 and 2009 was related to the intangible assets from our prior acquisitions, which
were fully amortized by the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

Restructuring Charges

During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced restructuring measures designed to realign
resources and drive overall operating efficiencies across the Company. These measures impacted 56
positions, or less than 2% of our global workforce, in various geographies and functions worldwide.
The reorganization plan was completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.

We recorded total restructuring charges of $10.3 million in fiscal 2011, primarily related to
severance pay expenses.

We estimate that these measures will result in gross annual savings related to employee
compensation of approximately $4.0 million before taxes. However, there can be no assurance that
these expected savings will be completely realized in the future as they may be offset by increases
in other expenses.

The charges above, as well as the restructuring charges recorded in prior fiscal year (see below),
have been shown separately as restructuring charges on the consolidated statements of income. The
remaining accrual as of April 2, 2011 was primarily related to severance pay and benefits that are
expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2012.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we announced restructuring measures designed to drive
structural operating efficiencies across the Company. We completed this restructuring plan at the
end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and reduced our global workforce by approximately 200 net
positions, or about 6%. These employee terminations impacted various geographies and functions
worldwide. We recorded total restructuring charges of $30.1 million in fiscal 2010, primarily
related to severance pay expenses, which were paid in full as of April 2, 2011.

The $3.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2011 as compared to the
same period last year was mainly due to higher weighted-average fair values of stock awards granted
and lower forfeitures during the year. The $2.0 million increase in stock-based compensation
expense for fiscal 2010 as compared to the same period last year was due to an increase in the
number of shares granted, which was partly offset by declining weighted-average fair values of
stock awards vesting and an increase in the number of shares cancelled due to the fiscal 2010
restructuring.

Gain on Early Extinguishment of Convertible Debentures

During fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million in cash to repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount)
of our debentures and recognized a gain on early extinguishment of convertible debentures of $75.0
million, net of the write-off of the pro rata portions of unamortized debt discount and issuance
costs of $41.5 million and unamortized derivative valuation of $736 thousand.

We recorded an impairment loss on investments in non-marketable equity securities of $5.9 million
and $3.8 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to other-than-temporary decline in the
estimated fair value of certain investees.

We recognized impairment losses on investments of $54.1 million during fiscal 2009, which consisted
of $51.1 million related to marketable debt and equity securities and $3.0 million related to
non-marketable equity securities. Of the $51.1 million impairment loss recognized during fiscal
2009, $38.0 million was related to senior class asset-backed securities where the issuer went into
receivership and we concluded that it was not likely that we would recover the balance of our
investment. This decline in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary and, therefore, we
recognized an impairment loss of $38.0 million on these securities during fiscal 2009. We also
recognized an additional impairment loss of $10.0 million on marketable debt securities, primarily
due to the bankruptcy filing by one of the issuers of the marketable debt securities. Lastly, we
recognized another $3.1 million of impairment loss in marketable equity securities investment
during fiscal 2009 as a result of the continued decline in its market value, which led us to
believe that the decline in the market value was other than temporary.

The increase in interest and other expense, net in fiscal 2011 over the prior year was due
primarily to the interest expense related to the 2.625% Debentures. Interest and other income
(expense), net was a net expense of $6.6 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a net income of $7.6
million in fiscal 2009. Interest income in 2010 decreased over the prior year was due primarily to
a decrease in interest rates earned on the investment portfolio. The average interest rate yield
in fiscal 2010 on our investments decreased by over 2.5 percentage points as compared to fiscal
2009 period. See “Note 12. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net” to our consolidated financial

The effective tax rates in all years reflected the favorable impact of foreign income at statutory
rates less than the U.S. rate and tax credits earned.

The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2011, when compared with fiscal 2010, was due to a
shift in the geographic mix of earnings subject to U.S. tax and to a reduction in the benefit of
U.S. tax credits in proportion to U.S. earnings. The fiscal 2011 increase was partially offset by
an increase in the amount of permanently reinvested foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes were
provided. In addition, the fiscal 2011 increase was partially offset by the retroactive extension
of the federal research credit.

The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010, when compared with fiscal 2009, was due to
an increase in the amount permanently reinvested outside the U.S. in fiscal 2010 for which no U.S.
taxes have been provided, thereby reducing the rates for the period, compounded by an increase in
the fiscal 2009 rate for the gain on early extinguishment of debentures taxable at U.S. tax rates.
The fiscal 2009 increase however was offset by a benefit from the retroactive extension of the
research credit.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited and issued proposed adjustments to our tax returns for
fiscal 1996 through 2001. We filed petitions with the Tax Court in response to assertions by the
IRS relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. All issues have been settled with the IRS as described
below.

On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options
must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with us
that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement, and entered its
decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals (Appeals Court). On May 27, 2009, we received a 2-1 adverse judicial ruling from
the Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision; this adverse ruling was later withdrawn on
January 13, 2010 after oral arguments. On March 22, 2010, the Appeals Court affirmed the August
30, 2005 Tax Court decision in our favor. On June 21, 2010, the time for the IRS to appeal the
March 22, 2010 decision to the United States Supreme Court lapsed. As a result, all issues
concerning this matter are closed.

In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency
reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal 2005. We began negotiations with the IRS Appeals
Division in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, and settled the remaining proposed adjustment in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 with no net change in tax liability. On September 20, 2010, pursuant
to stipulations filed by us and the IRS, the Tax Court entered its final order closing all
remaining fiscal 2005 issues. We received a small refund and, accordingly, all matters with the
IRS relating to fiscal 2005 are resolved. See “Note 16. Income Taxes” and “Note 18. Litigation
Settlements and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8.
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have historically used a combination of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing
to support ongoing business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary
technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common stock and debentures
under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working capital. Additionally, our
investments in debt securities are available for future sale.

Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and Long-term Investments

The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of April 2,
2011 and April 3, 2010 totaled $2.69 billion and $1.97 billion, respectively. As of April 2, 2011,
we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.93 billion and working capital of
$2.25 billion. Cash provided by operations of $724.2 million for fiscal 2011 was $169.9 million
higher than the $554.3 million generated during fiscal 2010. Cash provided by operations during
fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items and deferred
income on shipment to distributors, which were partially offset by increases in inventories,
accounts receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable.

Net cash used in investing activities was $625.4 million during fiscal 2011, as compared to net
cash provided by investing activities of $336.7 million in fiscal 2010. Net cash used in investing
activities during fiscal 2011 primarily consisted of $526.4 million of net purchases of
available-for-sale securities, $65.0 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see
further discussion below) and $33.7 million for acquisition of businesses.



Net cash provided by financing activities was $92.2 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to net cash
used in financing activities of $252.1 million in fiscal 2010. Net cash provided by financing
activities during fiscal 2011 consisted of $587.6 million of net proceeds from issuance of the
2.625% Debentures, $170.4 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock
plans, $46.9 million of proceeds from issuance of warrants, $30.2 million of proceeds from sale of
interest rate swaps and $7.4 million for the excess of the tax benefit from stock-based
compensation, offset by $468.9 million of repurchase of common stocks, $169.1 million for dividend
payments to stockholders and $112.3 million for purchase of call options to hedge against potential
dilution upon conversion of the 2.625% Debentures.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor
pricing adjustments increased by 9% from $262.7 million at the end of fiscal 2010 to $286.5 million
at the end of fiscal 2011. The increase in accounts receivable balance was primarily attributable
to increase in net revenues in fiscal 2011 from the comparable prior year period. Due to higher
accounts receivable collection, DSO decreased to 45 days as of April 2, 2011 from 53 days as of
April 3, 2010.

Inventories

Inventories increased from $130.6 million as of April 3, 2010 to $264.7 million as of April 2,
2011. The combined inventory days at Xilinx and the distribution channel increased to 135 days as
of April 2, 2011, compared to 89 days as of April 3, 2010. The increases were primarily due to
build ahead of a number of legacy parts due to the closure of a particular foundry line and higher
safety stock levels on certain parts in light of tight capacity at our foundry partners in
anticipation of future demand.

We attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product, package and speed
configurations in order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand and address
potential supply constraints. Conversely, we also attempt to minimize the handling costs
associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost
reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements. We continually
strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive
cost.

Property, Plant and Equipment

During fiscal 2011, we invested $65.0 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $28.2
million in fiscal 2010. Primary investments in fiscal 2011 were for testers, handlers, equipment
and software in order to support our new products development and infrastructures.

Current Liabilities

Current liabilities increased from $357.2 million at the end of fiscal 2010 to $368.1 million at
the end of fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to the increase in deferred income on
shipments to distributors and other accruals related to the growth in our overall business,
partially offset by the decrease in income taxes payable because we were in prepaid position at the
end of fiscal 2011.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stockholders’ equity increased $294.1 million during fiscal 2011, from $2.12 billion in fiscal 2010
to $2.41 billion in fiscal 2011. The increase in stockholders’ equity was attributable to total
comprehensive income of $653.6 million (which included net income of $641.9 million) for fiscal
2011, issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $170.4 million, the equity (conversion
option) components of the 2.625% Debentures issued in June 2010 of $108.1 million, stock-based
compensation related amounts totaling $65.5 million (including the related tax benefits associated
with stock option exercises), and proceeds from issuance of warrants of $46.9 million. The
increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of $468.9 million, payment of
dividends to stockholders of $169.1 million and purchase of call options to hedge against potential
dilution upon conversion of the 2.625% Debentures of $112.3 million.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and Long-term Investments

The combination of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of April 3,
2010 and March 28, 2009 totaled $1.97 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively. As of April 3,
2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.39 billion and working capital
of $1.55 billion. Cash provided by operations of $554.3 million for fiscal 2010 was $111.8 million
higher than the $442.5 million generated during fiscal 2009. Cash provided by operations during
fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items, increases in
accrued liabilities, accounts payable and deferred income on shipment to distributors, which were
partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, other assets, inventories and prepaid and
other current assets as well as a decrease in income taxes payable.



Net cash used in investing activities was $336.7 million during fiscal 2010, as compared to net
cash provided by investing activities of $274.5 million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in investing
activities during fiscal 2010 consisted of $306.3 million of net purchases of available-for-sale
securities and $28.2 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further discussion
below) and $2.3 million of other investing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities was $252.1 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to $518.1
million in fiscal 2009. Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2010 consisted of
$150.0 million for the repurchase of common stock, $165.6 million for dividend payments to
stockholders and $1.3 million for reduction of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. These
items were partially offset by $64.9 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under
employee stock plans.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor
pricing adjustments increased by 21% from $216.4 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to $262.7
million at the end of fiscal 2010. DSO increased to 53 days as of April 3, 2010 from 43 days as of
March 28, 2009. The increases were primarily attributable to an increase in net shipments at the
end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.

Inventories

Inventories increased from $119.8 million as of March 28, 2009 to $130.6 million as of April 3,
2010. The combined inventory days at Xilinx and the distribution channel increased to 89 days as
of April 3, 2010, compared to 80 days as of March 28, 2009. The increases were primarily due to
higher inventory at Xilinx and in the distributor channel as a result of the higher anticipated
demand.

Property, Plant and Equipment

During fiscal 2010, we invested $28.2 million in property, plant and equipment compared to $39.1
million in fiscal 2009. Primary investments in fiscal 2010 were for software, testers, handlers,
computer and other equipment.

Current Liabilities

Current liabilities increased from $233.1 million at the end of fiscal 2009 to $357.2 million at
the end of fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to the increase in trade payables and
accrued liabilities from variable spending driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2010 compared to the same prior year period, and an increase in deferred income on shipments
to distributors. The increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to an
increase in distributor inventories as of April 3, 2010 compared to the prior year.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stockholders’ equity increased $171.7 million during fiscal 2010, from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2009
to $2.12 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase in stockholders’ equity was attributable to total
comprehensive income of $375.1 million (which included net income of $357.5 million) for fiscal
2010, the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $60.1 million and stock-based
compensation related amounts totaling $52.1 million (net of the related tax benefits associated
with stock option exercises). The increases were partially offset by the payment of dividends to
stockholders of $165.6 million and the repurchase of common stock of $150.0 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash generated from operations is used as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources.
Our investment portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $250.0 million
revolving credit facility entered into in April 2007. We are not aware of any lack of access to
the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance that access to the credit
facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Our credit facility
is not reliant upon a single bank. There have been no borrowings to date under our existing
revolving credit facility.

We used $468.9 million of cash to repurchase 17.8 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2011
compared with $150.0 million used to repurchase 6.2 million shares in fiscal 2010. During fiscal
2011, we paid $169.1 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing an aggregate amount of
$0.64 per common share. During fiscal 2010, we paid $165.6 million in cash dividends to
stockholders, representing an aggregate amount of $0.60 per common share. In addition, on March
10, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.19 per common share for the first
quarter of fiscal 2012. The dividend is payable on June 8, 2011 to stockholders of record on May
18, 2011. Our common stock and debentures repurchase program and dividend policy could be impacted
by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements relating to R&D,
investments and acquisitions, legal risks, principal and interest payments on our debentures and
other strategic investments.



The global credit crisis has imposed exceptional levels of volatility and disruption in the capital
markets, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, and increased counterparty risk.
Nevertheless, we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows from operations will
be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future. We will continue to evaluate
opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity, procurement of additional
capital equipment and facilities, development of new products and potential acquisitions of
technologies or businesses that could complement our business. However, the risk factors discussed
in Item 1A included in Part I and below could affect our cash positions adversely. In addition,
certain types of investments such as auction rate securities may present risks arising from
liquidity and/or credit concerns. In the event that our investments in auction rate securities
become illiquid, we do not expect this will materially affect our liquidity and capital resources
or results of operations.

As of April 2, 2011, marketable securities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs were
comprised of $35.0 million of student loan auction rate securities. The amount of assets and
liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as a percentage of the total
assets and liabilities measured at fair value was less than 2% as of April 2, 2011. See “Note 3.
Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information.

During fiscal 2011, we redeemed $20.2 million of student loan auction rate securities for cash at
par value. Additionally, during fiscal 2011, we sold $10.8 million notional value of student loan
auction rate securities and realized a $580 thousand loss.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of April 2, 2011 and the
effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
This table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current
liabilities as of April 2, 2011.

leases that expire at various dates through November 2035. Rent expense, net of rental
income, under all operating leases was approximately $4.9 million for fiscal 2011. See “Note
10. Commitments” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information about operating leases.

(2)

Due to the nature of our business, we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture
our silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The lengthy subcontractor
lead times require us to order the materials and services in advance, and we are obligated to
pay for the materials and services when completed. We expect to receive and pay for these
materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet delivery and
quality specifications.

As of April 2, 2011, we had $16.7 million of non-cancelable license obligations to

We committed up to $5.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to intellectual property

For purposes of this table we have assumed the principal of our debentures will be paid on
maturity dates, which is June 15, 2017 for the 2.625% senior convertible debentures and March
15, 2037 for the 3.125% junior convertible debentures. See “Note 14. Convertible Debentures
and Revolving Credit Facility” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8.
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information about our
debentures.



As of April 2, 2011, $45.3 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest
and penalties were classified as long-term income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet.
Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with
such liabilities, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the
respective taxing authorities. Therefore, liabilities for uncertain tax positions have been
excluded from the contractual obligations table above.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

As of April 2, 2011, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in
Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk” to our
consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data,” for information about recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of
adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of
fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately $2.33 billion as of April 2, 2011. Our
primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal
and meeting liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio includes municipal bonds, floating rate
notes, mortgage-backed securities, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds,
student loan auction rate securities and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. In
accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and
limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer’s credit rating. These
securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates
increase. A hypothetical 100 basis-point (one percentage point) increase or decrease in interest
rates compared to rates at April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010 would have affected the fair value of
our investment portfolio by less than $16.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively.

Credit Market Risk

Since September 2007, the global credit markets have experienced adverse conditions that have
negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities.
During this time, the global credit and capital markets experienced significant volatility and
disruption due to instability in the global financial system, uncertainty related to global
economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial stability. While general conditions
in the global credit markets have improved, there is a risk that we may incur additional
other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments should credit market
conditions deteriorate. See “Note 4. Financial Instruments” to our consolidated financial
statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional
information about our investments.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated
transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained and the hedged relationship has been
effective, are deferred and included in income or expenses in the same period that the underlying
transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are
recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred.

We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas operating expenses and
other liabilities when deemed appropriate. As of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010, we had the
following outstanding forward currency exchange contracts:

As part of our strategy to reduce volatility of operating expenses due to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations, we employ a hedging program with a five-quarter forward outlook for major
foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses. The outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts expire at various dates between April 2011 and May 2012. The net unrealized gain or
loss, which approximates the fair market value of the above contracts, was immaterial as of April
2, 2011 and April 3, 2010.

Our investments in several of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than
the U.S. dollar. As the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated at each quarter
end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the U.S.
dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments. These fluctuations are recorded within
stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Other
monetary foreign-denominated assets and liabilities are revalued on a monthly basis with gains and
losses on revaluation reflected in net income. A hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change
in foreign currency exchange rates at April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010 would have affected the
annualized foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by less than
$9.0 million for each year. In addition, a hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in
foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010 would have
affected the value of foreign-currency-denominated cash and investments by less than $5.0 million
as of each date.

XILINX, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Nature of Operations

Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company) designs, develops and markets programmable platforms,
including advanced integrated circuits, software design tools and predefined system functions
delivered as intellectual property cores. In addition to its programmable platforms, the Company
provides design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. The wafers
used to manufacture its products are obtained primarily from independent wafer manufacturers
located in Taiwan and Japan. The Company is dependent on these foundries to produce and deliver
silicon wafers on a timely basis. The Company is also dependent on subcontractors, primarily
located in the Asia Pacific region, to provide semiconductor assembly, test and shipment services.
Xilinx is a global company with sales offices throughout the world. The Company derives over
one-half of its revenues from international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and
Japan.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Xilinx and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany transactions. The Company uses a
52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2011 and 2009 were a
52-week year ended on April 2, 2011 and March 28, 2009, respectively. Fiscal 2010 was a 53-week
year ended on April 3, 2010. Fiscal 2012 will be a 52-week year ending on March 31, 2012.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such
estimates relate to, among others, the useful lives of assets, assessment of recoverability of
property, plant and equipment, long-lived assets including acquisition-related intangible assets
and goodwill, inventory write-downs, allowances for doubtful accounts customer returns and deferred
tax assets, stock-based compensation, potential reserves relating to litigation and tax matters,
valuation of certain investments and derivative financial instruments as well as other accruals or
reserves. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to
the financial statements.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities from the date of
purchase of three months or less. These investments consist of commercial paper, bank certificates
of deposit, money market funds and time deposits. Short-term investments consist of municipal
bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities,
floating rate notes, mortgage-backed securities and bank certificates of deposit with original
maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year from the balance
sheet date. Long-term investments consist of U.S. and foreign government and agency securities,
corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, floating rate notes and municipal bonds with remaining
maturities greater than one year, unless the investments are specifically identified to fund
current operations, in which case they are classified as short-term investments. As of April 2,
2011 and April 3, 2010, long-term investments also included approximately $35.0 million and $61.6
million, respectively, of auction rate securities that experienced failed auctions in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2008. These auction rate securities are secured primarily by pools of student
loans originated under Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) that are substantially
guaranteed by the U. S. Department of Education. Equity investments are also classified as
long-term investments since they are not intended to fund current operations.

The Company maintains its cash balances with various banks with high quality ratings, and
investment banking and asset management institutions. The Company manages its liquidity risk by
investing in a variety of money market funds, high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds,
municipal bonds and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. This diversification of
investments is consistent with its policy to maintain liquidity and ensure the ability to collect
principal. The Company maintains an offshore investment portfolio denominated in U.S. dollars.
All investments are made pursuant to corporate investment policy guidelines. Investments include
Euro commercial paper, Euro dollar bonds, Euro dollar floating rate notes, offshore time deposits,
U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S.
government-sponsored enterprises and agencies.



Management classifies investments as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase
and re-evaluates such designation at each balance sheet date, although classification is not
generally changed. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive
intent and the ability to hold the securities until maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are
carried at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such
amortization, as well as any interest on the
securities, is included in interest income. No investments were classified as held-to-maturity as
of April 2, 2011 or April 3, 2010. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the
unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. See “Note 3. Fair Value Measurements” for information
relating to the determination of fair value. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities are included in interest and other income (expense), net, and declines in value judged
to be other than temporary are included in impairment loss on investments. The cost of securities
matured or sold is based on the specific identification method.

In determining whether a decline in value of non-marketable equity investments in private companies
is other than temporary, the assessment is made by considering available evidence including the
general market conditions in the investee’s industry, the investee’s product development status,
the investee’s ability to meet business milestones and the financial condition and near-term
prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash,
the investee’s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation and bona fide offers to
purchase the investee from a prospective acquirer. When a decline in value is deemed to be other
than temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period’s operating results
to the extent of the decline.

Accounts Receivable

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company’s best estimate of probable losses
inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on the
aging of Xilinx’s accounts receivable, historical experience, known troubled accounts, management
judgment and other currently available evidence. Xilinx writes off accounts receivable against the
allowance when Xilinx determines a balance is uncollectible and no longer actively pursues
collection of the receivable. The amounts of accounts receivable written off were insignificant for
all periods presented.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out
method), or market (estimated net realizable value) and are comprised of the following:

The Company reviews and sets standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing
costs. The Company’s manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming
full absorption of actual spending over actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the
cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, the Company
writes down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are
impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and
changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual
demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on
recorded inventory values.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
for financial reporting purposes is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets of three to five years for machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures
and 15 to 30 years for buildings. Depreciation expense totaled $50.4 million, $50.2 million and
$55.6 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquisition-Related Intangibles

The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible
assets to be held and used for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment
indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are
held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets. In
the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the
assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted
future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. When assets are removed from
operations and held for sale, Xilinx estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying
value of the assets over their fair value.



Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently
if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. All other
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment.
Based on the impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, there was no
impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2011. Unless there are indicators of impairment, the Company’s
next impairment review for goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2012. To date, no impairment indicators have been identified.

Revenue Recognition

Sales to distributors are made under agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights
of return under certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are
deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors’ end customers. For
fiscal 2011, approximately 63% of the Company’s net revenues were from products sold to
distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract manufacturers. Revenue recognition
depends on notification from the distributor that product has been sold to the distributor’s end
customer. Also reported by the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer
shipment information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on hand is
reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. The Company maintains system controls to validate
distributor data and to verify that the reported information is accurate. Deferred income on
shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of
gross margin expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from the
Company. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved when title
to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from Xilinx at which point the Company has a
legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms.

As of April 2, 2011, the Company had $134.0 million of deferred revenue and $34.2 million of
deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $99.8 million of deferred income on shipments to
distributors. As of April 3, 2010, the Company had $110.4 million of deferred revenue and $30.3
million of deferred cost of revenues recognized as a net $80.1 million of deferred income on
shipments to distributors. The deferred income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately
be recognized in the Company’s consolidated statement of income will be different than the amount
shown on the consolidated balance sheet due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors
when the product is sold to their end customers.

Revenue from sales to the Company’s direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that
persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred,
collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer acceptance
requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of the periods presented, there
were no significant formal acceptance provisions with the Company’s direct customers.

Revenue from software licenses is deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses
of one year. Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed. Revenue
from Support Products, which includes software and services sales, was less than 6% of net revenues
for all of the periods presented.

Allowances for end customer sales returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known
pending customer returns or allowances.

Foreign Currency Translation

The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company’s Ireland and Singapore subsidiaries.
Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into U.S.
dollars, and the resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of income
under interest and other income (expense), net. The remeasurement gains or losses were immaterial
for all fiscal periods presented.

The local currency is the functional currency for each of the Company’s other wholly-owned foreign
subsidiaries. Assets and liabilities are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at
month-end exchange rates and statements of income are translated at the average monthly exchange
rates. Exchange gains or losses arising from translation of foreign currency denominated assets
and liabilities (i.e., cumulative translation adjustment) are included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Derivative Financial Instruments

To reduce financial risk, the Company periodically enters into financial arrangements as part of
the Company’s ongoing asset and liability management activities. Xilinx uses derivative financial
instruments to hedge fair values of underlying assets and liabilities or future cash flows which
are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company does not enter into derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. See “Note 5. Derivative Financial Instruments”
for detailed information about the Company’s derivative financial instruments.



Research and Development Expenses

Research and development costs are current period expenses and charged to expense as incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has equity incentive plans that are more fully discussed in “Note 6. Stock-Based
Compensation Plans.” The authoritative guidance of accounting for share-based payment requires the
Company to measure the cost of all employee equity awards that are expected to be exercised based
on the grant-date fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over
the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award (over
the vesting period of the award). In addition, the Company is required to record compensation
expense (as previous awards continue to vest) for the unvested portion of previously granted awards
that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. The authoritative guidance of accounting for
share-based payment requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a
part of cash flows from financing activities. Excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from
tax deductions for exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock
compensation costs for such options. The exercise price of employee stock options is equal to the
market price of Xilinx common stock (defined as the closing trading price reported by The NASDAQ
Global Select Market) on the date of grant. Additionally, Xilinx’s employee stock purchase plan is
deemed a compensatory plan under the authoritative guidance of accounting for share-based payment.
Accordingly, the employee stock purchase plan is included in the computation of stock-based
compensation expense.

The Company uses the straight-line attribution method to recognize stock-based compensation costs
over the requisite service period of the award. Upon exercise, cancellation or expiration of stock
options, deferred tax assets for options with multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each
vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each award had a separate vesting period. To
calculate the excess tax benefits available for use in offsetting future tax shortfalls as of the
date of implementation, the Company followed the alternative transition method.

Income Taxes

All income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method under the accounting for income
taxes, as interpreted by FASB authoritative guidance for measuring uncertain tax positions

.

Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial and income tax reporting purposes.

Product Warranty and Indemnification

The Company generally sells products with a limited warranty for product quality. The Company
provides an accrual for known product issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
As of the end of both fiscal 2011 and 2010, the accrual balance of the product warranty liability
was immaterial.

The Company offers, subject to certain terms and conditions, to indemnify certain customers and
distributors for costs and damages awarded against these parties in the event the Company’s
hardware products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, including
patents, copyrights or trademarks, and to compensate certain customers for limited specified costs
they actually incur in the event our hardware products experience epidemic failure. To a lesser
extent, the Company may from time-to-time offer limited indemnification with respect to its
software products. The terms and conditions of these indemnity obligations are limited by
contract, which obligations are typically perpetual from the effective date of the agreement. The
Company has historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these
provisions and has not made any significant payments pursuant to these provisions. The Company
cannot estimate the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, that the Company may be
required to make as a result of these obligations due to the limited history of indemnification
claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular
claim and indemnification provision. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will not
incur any financial liabilities in the future as a result of these obligations.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Avnet, one of the Company’s distributors, distributes the substantial majority of the Company’s
products worldwide. As of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010, Avnet accounted for 79% and 83% of the
Company’s total accounts receivable, respectively. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for
51%, 49% and 55% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The percentage of accounts receivable due from Avnet and the percentage of worldwide
net revenues from Avnet are consistent with historical patterns.

Xilinx is subject to concentrations of credit risk primarily in its trade accounts receivable and
investments in debt securities to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance
sheet. The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables
through its credit evaluation process, collection terms, distributor sales to diverse end customers
and through
geographical dispersion of sales. Xilinx generally does not require collateral for receivables
from its end customers or from distributors.



No end customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented.

The Company mitigates concentrations of credit risk in its investments in debt securities by
currently investing more than 94% of its portfolio in AA or higher grade securities as rated by
Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s Investors Service. The Company’s methods to arrive at investment
decisions are not solely based on the rating agencies’ credit ratings. Xilinx also performs
additional credit due diligence and conducts regular portfolio credit reviews, including a review
of counterparty credit risk related to the Company’s forward currency exchange and interest rate
swap contracts. Additionally, Xilinx limits its investments in the debt securities of a single
issuer based upon the issuer’s credit rating and attempts to further mitigate credit risk by
diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer. As of April 2, 2011, 52% and 48% of its
investments in debt securities were domestic and foreign issuers, respectively. See “Note 4.
Financial Instruments” for detailed information about the Company’s investment portfolio.

As of April 2, 2011, less than 2% of the Company’s $2.60 billion investment portfolio consisted of
student loan auction rate securities and all of these securities are rated AAA with the exception
of $3.8 million that were downgraded to an A rating during fiscal 2009. Nearly all of the
underlying assets that secure these securities are pools of student loans originated under the
FFELP, which are substantially guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. These securities
experienced failed auctions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 due to liquidity issues in the
global credit markets. In a failed auction, the interest rates are reset to a maximum rate defined
by the contractual terms for each security. The Company has collected and expects to collect all
interest payable on these securities when due. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, $20.2 million and $1.3
million, respectively, of these student loan auction rate securities were redeemed for cash by the
issuers at par value. In addition, during fiscal 2011 the Company sold $10.8 million notional
value of student loan auction rate securities and realized a $580 thousand loss. Because there can
be no assurance of a successful auction in the future, the student loan auction rate securities are
reclassified as long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The maturity dates range
from December 2027 to May 2046.

As of April 2, 2011, approximately 23% of the portfolio consisted of mortgage-backed securities.
All of the mortgage-backed securities in the investment portfolio are AAA rated and were issued by
U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies.

The global credit and capital markets have continued to experience adverse conditions that have
negatively impacted the values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities,
and have experienced volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system,
uncertainty related to global economic conditions and concerns regarding sovereign financial
stability. While general conditions in the global credit markets have improved, there is a risk
that the Company may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments
should credit market conditions deteriorate or the underlying assets fail to perform as
anticipated. See “Note 4. Financial Instruments” for a table of the Company’s available-for-sale
securities.

Dependence on Independent Manufacturers and Subcontractors

The Company does not directly manufacture the finished silicon wafers used to manufacture its
products. Xilinx receives a majority of its finished wafers from one independent wafer
manufacturer located in Taiwan. The Company is also dependent on a limited number of
subcontractors, primarily located in the Asia Pacific region, to provide semiconductor assembly,
test and shipment services.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance to update the accounting and reporting
requirements for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. This guidance established a
selling price hierarchy, which allows the use of an estimated selling price to determine the
selling price of a deliverable in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor
third-party evidence is available. This guidance is to be applied prospectively for revenue
arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15,
2010, which for the Company is its fiscal 2012. Early adoption is permitted, and if this update is
adopted early in other than the first quarter of an entity’s fiscal year, then it must be applied
retrospectively to the beginning of that fiscal year. The Company does not expect this guidance to
have significant impacts on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance that clarifies which revenue allocation
and measurement guidance should be used for arrangements that contain both tangible products and
software, in cases where the software is more than incidental to the tangible product as a whole.
More specifically, if the software sold with or embedded within the tangible product is essential
to the functionality of the tangible product, then this software as well as undelivered software
elements that relate to this software are excluded from the scope of existing software revenue
guidance. This guidance is to be applied prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which for the Company is
its fiscal 2012. Early adoption is permitted, and if this update is adopted early in other than
the first quarter of an entity’s fiscal year, then it must be applied retrospectively to the
beginning of that fiscal year. The Company does not expect this guidance to have significant
impacts on its consolidated financial statements.



In January 2010, the FASB issued amended standards that require additional disclosures about inputs
and valuation techniques used to measure fair value as well as disclosures about significant
transfers, beginning in the Company’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Additionally, these amended
standards require presentation of disaggregated activity within the reconciliation for fair value
measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), beginning in the Company’s first
quarter of fiscal 2012.

In April 2010, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance on milestone method of revenue
recognition. Under the new guidance, an entity can recognize revenue from consideration that is
contingent upon achievement of a milestone in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if
the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive. This guidance is to be applied
prospectively for milestones achieved in fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which for the Company is its fiscal 2012. Early adoption is
permitted, and if this update is adopted early in other than the first quarter of an entity’s
fiscal year, then it must be applied retrospectively to the beginning of that fiscal year. The
Company does not expect this guidance to have significant impacts on its consolidated financial
statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance to amend Step 1 of the goodwill
impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting
units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely
than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than
not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse
qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. This guidance is effective for public
entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15,
2010, which for Xilinx is its first quarter fiscal 2012. The Company does not expect these new
standards to have significant impacts on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance to clarify the pro forma revenue and
earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations. The guidance specifies that if a public
entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings
of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year
had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. This
guidance is effective for public entities prospectively for business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or
after December 15, 2010, which for Xilinx is its first quarter fiscal 2012.

Note 3. Fair Value Measurements

The guidance for fair value measurements established by the FASB defines fair value as the exchange
price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining
the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair
value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which Xilinx would
transact and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset
or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.

The Company determines the fair value for marketable debt securities using industry standard
pricing services, data providers and other third-party sources and by internally performing
valuation analyses. The Company primarily uses a consensus price or weighted average price for its
fair value assessment. The Company determines the consensus price using market prices from a
variety of industry standard pricing services, data providers, security master files from large
financial institutions and other third party sources and uses those multiple prices as inputs into
a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily market value. The pricing services use
multiple inputs to determine market prices, including reportable trades, benchmark yield curves,
credit spreads and broker/dealer quotes as well as other industry and economic events. For certain
securities with short maturities, such as discount commercial paper and certificates of deposit,
the security is accreted from purchase price to face value at maturity. If a subsequent
transaction on the same security is observed in the marketplace, the price on the subsequent
transaction is used as the current daily market price and the security will be accreted to face
value based on the revised price. For certain other securities, such as student loan auction rate
securities, the Company performs its own valuation analysis using a discounted cash flow pricing
model.

The Company validates the consensus prices by taking random samples from each asset type and
corroborating those prices using reported trade activity, benchmark yield curves, binding
broker/dealer quotes or other relevant price information. There have not been any changes to the
Company’s fair value methodology during fiscal 2010 and the Company did not adjust or override any
fair value measurements as of April 2, 2011.



Fair Value Hierarchy

The measurements of fair value were established based on a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the utilized inputs. This hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair
value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon
the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. The guidance for fair value
measurements requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed
in one of the following categories:

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

The Company’s Level 1 assets consist of U.S. Treasury securities and money market funds.

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

The Company’s Level 2 assets consist of bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper,
corporate bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities, foreign government and agency securities,
floating-rate notes and mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities
include foreign currency forward contracts.

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no
market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or
liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are
determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation
techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.

The Company’s Level 3 assets and liabilities include student loan auction rate securities and the
embedded derivative related to the Company’s debentures.



Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair
value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the
significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment,
including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. The following tables
present information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010:

(38,006

)

As of April 2, 2011, marketable securities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs were
comprised of $35.0 million of student loan auction rate securities. Auction failures and the lack
of market activity and liquidity required that the Company’s student loan auction rate securities
be measured using observable market data and Level 3 inputs. The fair values of the Company’s
student loan auction rate securities were based on the Company’s assessment of the underlying
collateral and the creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities. Nearly all of the underlying
assets that secure the student loan auction rate securities are pools of student loans originated
under FFELP, which are substantially guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. The fair
values of the Company’s student loan auction rate securities were determined using a discounted
cash flow pricing model that incorporated financial inputs such as projected cash flows, discount
rates, expected interest rates to be paid to investors and an estimated liquidity discount. The
weighted-average life over which cash flows were projected was determined to be approximately nine
years, given the collateral composition of the securities. The discount rates that were applied to
the pricing model were based on market data and information for comparable- or similar-term student
loan asset-backed securities. The expected interest rate to be paid to investors in a failed
auction was determined by the contractual terms for each security. The liquidity discount
represents an estimate of the additional return an investor would require to compensate for the
lack of liquidity of the student loan auction rate securities. The Company does not intend to
sell, nor does it believe it is more likely than not that it would be required to sell, the student
loan auction rate securities before anticipated recovery, which could be at final maturity that
ranges from December 2027 to May 2046.

In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00 billion principal amount of 3.125% junior convertible
debentures due March 15, 2037 (3.125% Debentures) to an initial purchaser in a private offering.
As a result of repurchases in fiscal 2009, the remaining principal amount of the 3.125% Debentures
as of April 2, 2011 was $689.6 million. The fair value of the 3.125% Debentures as of April 2,
2011 was approximately $791.3 million, based on the last trading price of the 3.125% Debentures for
the period. The 3.125% Debentures included embedded features that qualify as an embedded
derivative under authoritative guidance for derivatives instruments and hedging activities issued
by the FASB. The embedded derivative was separately accounted for as a discount on the 3.125%
Debentures and its fair value was established at the inception of the 3.125% Debentures. Each
quarter, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative, if any, is recorded in the
consolidated statements of income. The Company uses a derivative valuation model to derive the
value of the embedded derivative. Key inputs into this valuation model are the Company’s current
stock price, risk-free interest rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock volatility and the
3.125% Debenture’s credit spread over London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The first three
inputs are based on observable market data and are considered Level 2 inputs while the last two
inputs require management judgment and are Level 3 inputs.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

As of April 2, 2011, the Company had non-marketable equity securities in private companies of $11.4
million (adjusted cost, which approximates fair value). The Company’s investments in
non-marketable securities of private companies are accounted for by using the cost method. The
fair value of the Company’s cost method investments is not estimated if there are no identified
events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of
these investments. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when they
are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In determining whether a decline in value of
non-marketable equity investments in private companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an
assessment is made by considering available evidence, including the general market conditions in
the investee’s industry, the investee’s product development status and subsequent rounds of
financing and the related valuation and/or Xilinx’s participation in such financings. The Company
also assesses the investee’s ability to meet business milestones, the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using
its cash, the investee’s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation and bona fide
offers to purchase the investee from a prospective acquirer. The valuation methodology for
determining the fair value of non-marketable equity securities is based on the factors noted above
which require management judgment and are Level 3 inputs. The Company recognized impairment losses
on non-marketable equity investments of $5.9 million, $3.8 million and $3.0 million during fiscal
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, due to other-than-temporary decline in the estimated fair value
of certain investees and other relevant considerations.

The gross unrealized losses on these investments were primarily related to failed auction rate
securities, which was due to adverse conditions in the global credit markets during the past three
years. The Company reviewed the investment portfolio and determined that the gross unrealized
losses on these investments as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010 were temporary in nature, as
evidenced by the reduction in the total gross unrealized losses in recent periods. The aggregate
of individual unrealized losses that had been outstanding for 12 months or more was not significant
as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010. The Company neither intends to sell these investments nor
concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that it will have to sell them until recovery of their
carrying values. The Company also believes that it will be able to collect both principal and
interest amounts due to the Company at maturity, given the high credit quality of these investments
and any related underlying collateral.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable debt securities (bank certificates of
deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, auction rate securities, municipal bonds, U.S. and
foreign government and agency securities, floating rate notes and mortgage-backed securities) as of

Note 5. Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company’s primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage foreign
currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. As a result of the use of derivative financial
instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts may
fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company manages counterparty credit risk in
derivative contracts by reviewing counterparty creditworthiness on a regular basis, establishing
collateral requirement and limiting exposure to any single counterparty. The right of set-off that
exists with certain transactions enables the Company to net amounts due to and from the
counterparty, reducing the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default.



As of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010, the Company had the following outstanding forward currency
exchange contracts which are derivative financial instruments:

As part of the Company’s strategy to reduce volatility of operating expenses due to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations, the Company employs a hedging program with a five-quarter forward
outlook for major foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses. The outstanding forward
currency exchange contracts expire at various dates between April 2011 and May 2012. The net
unrealized gain or loss, which approximates the fair market value of the above contracts, is
expected to be realized and reclassified into net income within the next 13 months.

As of April 2, 2011, all the forward foreign currency exchange contracts were designated and
qualified as cash flow hedges and the effective portion of the gain or loss on the forward contract
was reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into net income in the
same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the
gain or loss on the forward contract was immaterial and included in the net income for all periods
presented.

The Company may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments
such as the acquisition of capital expenditures. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward
contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment
has been attained and the hedged relationship has been effective, are deferred and included in
income or expenses in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses
on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the
consolidated statements of income as they are incurred.

The 3.125% Debentures include provisions which qualify as an embedded derivative. See “Note 10.
Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility” for detailed discussion about the embedded
derivative. The embedded derivative was separated from the 3.125% Debentures and its fair value
was established at the inception of the 3.125% Debentures. Any subsequent change in fair value of
the embedded derivative would be recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of income. The
fair value of the embedded derivative at inception of the debentures was $2.5 million and it
changed to $945 thousand and $848 thousand as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010, respectively.
The changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative of $97 thousand (expense) and $1.3 million
(income) during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, were recorded to interest and other income
(expense), net on the Company’s consolidated statement of income.

The following table summarizes the fair value and presentation in the consolidated balance sheets
for derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010,
utilized for risk management purposes detailed above:

Note 6. Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company’s equity incentive plans are broad-based, long-term retention programs that cover
employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. These plans are intended to
attract and retain talented employees, consultants and non-employee directors and to provide such
persons with a proprietary interest in the Company.

Stock-Based Compensation

under the Company’s equity incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under the Company’s

In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for share-based payments, the Company
adjusts stock-based compensation on a quarterly basis for changes to the estimate of expected
equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture experience. The effect of adjusting the
forfeiture rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is
changed. The actual forfeiture true up and estimate adjustments in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were
$14.1 million, $16.7 million and $15.8 million, respectively.

As of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010, the ending inventory balances included $1.5 million and $1.1
million of capitalized stock-based compensation, respectively. The net stock-based compensation
capitalized to or released from inventory during fiscal 2011 and 2010 were immaterial. During
fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, the tax benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises
and other awards, including amounts credited to additional paid-in capital, totaled $25.6 million,
$9.3 million and $11.4 million.

The fair values of stock options and stock purchase plan rights under the Company’s equity
incentive plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated as of the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company’s expected stock price volatility assumption for
stock options is estimated using implied volatility of the Company’s traded options. The expected
life of options granted is based on the historical exercise activity as well as the expected
disposition of all options outstanding. The expected life of options granted also considers the
actual contractual term. The per-share weighted-average fair values of
stock options granted during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $6.80, $5.68 and $7.28, respectively.
The per share weighted-average fair values of stock purchase rights granted under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $8.25, $6.29 and $6.45, respectively.
The fair values of stock options and stock purchase plan rights granted in fiscal 2011, 2010 and
2009 were estimated at the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions:

The estimated fair values of RSU awards were calculated based on the market price of Xilinx common
stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on Xilinx
common stock prior to vesting. The per share weighted-average
fair values of RSUs granted during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $25.14, $20.38 and
$21.89, respectively. The weighted-average fair values of RSUs granted in fiscal 2011, 2010 and

These amounts represent the difference between the exercise
price and $32.15, the closing price per share of Xilinx’s stock on April 1,
2011, for all in-the-money options outstanding.

Options outstanding that are expected to vest are net of estimated future option forfeitures in
accordance with the authoritative guidance of accounting for share-based payment, which are
estimated when compensation costs are recognized. Options with a fair value of $16.5 million
completed vesting during fiscal 2011. As of April 2, 2011, total unrecognized stock-based
compensation costs related to stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan was $26.7 million and
$16.4 million, respectively. The total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost for stock
options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.6 years and 1.2 years, respectively.

Employee Stock Option Plans

Under the Company’s stock option plans (Option Plans), options reserved for future issuance of
common shares to employees and directors of the Company total 44.5 million shares as of April 2,
2011, including 7.4 million shares available for future grants under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
(2007 Equity Plan). Options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock under the Option
Plans are granted at 100% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. The
contractual term for stock awards granted under the 2007 Equity Plan is seven years from the grant
date. Prior to April 1, 2007, stock options granted by the Company generally expire ten years from
the grant date. Stock awards granted to existing and newly hired employees generally vest over a
four-year period from the date of grant.

The 2007 Equity Plan, which became effective on January 1, 2007, replaced both the Company’s 1997
Stock Plan (which expired on May 8, 2007) and the Supplemental Stock Option Plan and all available
but unissued shares under these prior plans were cancelled as of April 1, 2007. The 2007 Equity
Plan is now Xilinx’s only plan for providing stock-based awards to eligible employees and
non-employee directors. The types of awards allowed under the 2007 Equity Plan include incentive
stock options, non-qualified stock options, RSUs, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights.
To date, the Company has issued a mix of non-qualified stock options and RSUs under the 2007 Equity
Plan. The mix of stock options and RSU awards changes depending upon the grade level of the
employees. Employees at the lower grade levels typically receive mostly RSUs and may also receive
stock options, whereas employees at the higher grade levels, including the Company’s executive
officers, typically receive mostly stock options and may also receive RSUs.

The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2011 and 2010 was $28.3
million and $3.0 million, respectively. This intrinsic value represents the difference between the
exercise price and the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise.

Since the Company adopted the policy of retiring all repurchased shares of its common stock, new
shares are issued upon employees’ exercise of their stock options.

The number of RSUs vested includes shares that the Company withheld on behalf of employees to
satisfy the statutory tax withholding requirements.

RSUs with a fair value of $26.5 million were vested during fiscal 2011. As of April 2, 2011,
total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to non-vested RSUs was $74.3 million.
The total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost for RSUs is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 2.7 years.

Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan

Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, qualified employees can obtain a 24-month purchase right to
purchase the Company’s common stock at the end of each six-month exercise period. Participation is
limited to 15% of the employee’s annual earnings up to a maximum of $21 thousand in a calendar
year. Approximately 76% of all eligible employees participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of
the 24-month offering period or at the end of each six-month exercise period. Employees purchased
2.3 million shares for $33.3 million in fiscal 2011, 2.0 million shares for $28.0 million in fiscal
2010 and 2.2 million shares for $34.5 million in fiscal 2009. As of April 2, 2011, 7.4 million
shares were available for future issuance out of the 44.5 million shares authorized.

Note 8. Restructuring Charges

During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company announced restructuring measures designed to
realign resources and drive overall operating efficiencies across the Company. These measures
impacted 56 positions, or less than 2% of the Company’s global workforce, in various geographies
and functions worldwide. The reorganization plan was completed by the end of the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2011.

The Company recorded total restructuring charges of $10.3 million in fiscal 2011, primarily related
to severance pay expenses.

The charges above, as well as the restructuring charges recorded in prior fiscal year (see below),
have been shown separately as restructuring charges on the consolidated statements of income. The
remaining accrual as of April 2, 2011 was primarily related to severance pay and benefits that are
expected to be paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2012.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company announced restructuring measures designed to
drive structural operating efficiencies across the Company. The Company completed this
restructuring plan in the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and reduced the Company’s
global workforce by approximately 200 net positions, or about 6%. These employee terminations
impacted various geographies and functions worldwide. The Company recorded total restructuring
charges of $30.1 million in fiscal 2010, primarily related to severance pay expenses, which were
paid in full as of April 2, 2011.

Note 9. Impairment Loss on Investments

The Company recorded an impairment loss on investments in non-marketable equity securities of $5.9
million and $3.8 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to other-than-temporary
decline in the estimated fair value of certain investees and other relevant considerations.

The Company recognized impairment losses on investments of $54.1 million during fiscal 2009, which
consisted of $51.1 million related to marketable debt and equity securities and $3.0 million
related to non-marketable equity securities. Of the $51.1 million impairment loss recognized during
fiscal 2009, $38.0 million was related to senior class asset-backed securities where the issuer
went into receivership and the Company concluded that it was not likely that the Company would
recover the balance of our investment. This decline in fair value was deemed to be other than
temporary and, therefore, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $38.0 million on these
securities during fiscal 2009. The Company also recognized an additional impairment loss of $10.0
million on marketable debt securities, primarily due to the bankruptcy filing by one of the issuers
of the marketable debt securities. Lastly, the Company recognized another $3.1 million of
impairment loss in marketable equity securities investment during fiscal 2009 as a result of the
continued decline in its market value, which led the Company to believe that the decline in the
market value was other than temporary.



Note 10. Commitments

Xilinx leases some of its facilities and office buildings under non-cancelable operating leases
that expire at various dates through January 2018. Additionally, Xilinx entered into a land lease
in conjunction with the Company’s building in Singapore, which will
expire in November 2035 and the lease cost was settled in an up-front payment in June 2006. Some
of the operating leases for facilities and office buildings require payment of operating costs,
including property taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance. Most of the Company’s leases contain
renewal options for varying terms. Approximate future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable
operating leases are as follows:

Aggregate future rental income to be received, which includes rents from both owned and leased
property, totaled $10.6 million as of April 2, 2011. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all
operating leases was $4.9 million for fiscal 2011, $5.3 million for fiscal 2010, and $9.2 million
for fiscal 2009. Rental income, which includes rents received from both owned and leased property,
was not material for fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Other commitments as of April 2, 2011 totaled $141.3 million and consisted of purchases of
inventory and other non-cancelable purchase obligations related to subcontractors that manufacture
silicon wafers and provide assembly as well as some test services. The Company expects to receive
and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six months, as the products meet
delivery and quality specifications. As of April 2, 2011, the Company also had $16.7 million of
non-cancelable license obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and
hardware/software maintenance expiring at various dates through December 2013.

The Company committed up to $5.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to intellectual property
until July 2023. License payments will be amortized over the useful life of the intellectual
property acquired.

Note 11. Net Income Per Common Share

The computation of basic net income per common share for all periods presented is derived from the
information on the consolidated statements of income, and there are no reconciling items in the
numerator used to compute diluted net income per common share. The total shares used in the
denominator of the diluted net income per common share calculation includes 4.0 million, 941
thousand and 741 thousand potentially dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding for fiscal
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, that are not included in basic net income per common share.
Potentially dilutive common equivalent shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method
to the impact of incremental shares issuable assuming conversion of the debentures (see “Note 14.
Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility”), exercise of outstanding stock options,
vesting of outstanding RSUs and issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Outstanding stock options, RSUs and warrants (See “Note 14. Convertible Debentures and Revolving
Credit Facility” for more discussion of warrants) to purchase approximately 32.7 million, 44.0
million and 44.1 million shares, for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, under the Company’s
stock award plans were excluded from diluted net income per common share, applying the treasury
stock method, as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. These options, RSUs and warrants
could be dilutive in the future if the Company’s average share price increases and is greater than
the combined exercise prices and the unamortized fair values of these options, RSUs and warrants.

Note 14. Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility

2.625% Senior Convertible Debentures

In June 2010, the Company issued $600.0 million principal amount of 2.625% Debentures to qualified
institutional investors. The 2.625% Debentures are senior in right of payment to the Company’s
existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to
the 2.625% Debentures, including the 3.125% Debentures described below. The fair value of the
2.625% Debentures as of April 2, 2011 was approximately $748.1 million, based on the last trading
price of the 2.625% Debentures for the period. The 2.625% Debentures are initially convertible,
subject to certain conditions, into shares of Xilinx common stock at a conversion rate of 33.0164
shares of common stock per $1 thousand principal amount of the 2.625% Debentures, representing an
initial effective conversion price of approximately $30.29 per share of common stock. The
conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events as outlined in the indenture governing
the 2.625% Debentures but will not be adjusted for accrued interest.

The Company received net proceeds of $587.6 million from issuance of the 2.625% Debentures, after
deduction of issuance costs of $12.4 million. The debt issuance costs, as adjusted based on the
authoritative guidance for the accounting of convertible debentures issued by the FASB, are
recorded in current and non-current assets and are being amortized to interest expense over 7
years. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15, beginning on
December 15, 2010. The Company recognizes an effective interest rate of 5.75% on the carrying value
of the 2.625% Debentures. The effective rate is based on the interest rate for a similar
instrument that does not have a conversion feature. Additionally, the Company may be required to
pay additional interest under certain events as outlined in the indenture governing the 2.625%
Debentures. During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company utilized $433.3 million of the net
proceeds to repurchase its common stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement. A portion
of the remaining net proceeds was used to purchase call options to hedge against potential dilution
upon conversion of the 2.625% Debentures (see below) as well as for other general corporate
purposes.

In relation to the issuance of the 2.625% Debentures, in June 2010 the Company entered into
interest rate swaps with certain independent financial institutions, whereby the Company paid a
variable interest rate equal to the three-month LIBOR minus 0.2077%, and received interest income
at a fixed interest rate of 2.625%. In October 2010, the Company sold the interest rate swaps for
$30.2 million. In accordance to the authoritative guidance for the accounting of derivative
instruments and hedging activities issued by the FASB, the fair value of hedge accounting
adjustment at the time of the sale ($29.9 million) is amortized as reduction to interest expense
over the remaining life of the 2.625% Debentures. Prior to the sale of the interest rate swaps,
from June to October 2010 the Company earned a net interest amount of $5.0 million from these
interest rate swaps, which was included in interest and
other income (expense), net, on the consolidated statements of income as a reduction to interest
expense. In addition, the net change in fair values of $268 thousand, from the interest rate swaps
(prior to the sale from June to October 2010) and the underlying 2.625% Debentures, was included as
a reduction to interest and other income (expense), net, on the Company’s consolidated statements
of income.



The carrying values of the liability and equity components of the 2.625% Debentures are reflected

term of the 2.625% Debentures. As of April 2, 2011, the remaining term of the 2.625% Debentures is
6.2 years.

The Company may not redeem the 2.625% Debentures prior to maturity. However, holders of the 2.625%
Debentures may convert their 2.625% Debentures only upon the occurrence of certain events in the
future, as outlined in the indenture. The Company will adjust the conversion rate for holders who
elect to convert their 2.625% Debentures in connection with the occurrence of certain specified
corporate events, as defined in the indenture. In addition, holders who convert their 2.625%
Debentures in connection with a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture, may be entitled to
a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Furthermore, in the event
of a fundamental change, the holders of the 2.625% Debentures may require Xilinx to purchase all or
a portion of their 2.625% Debentures at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the 2.625% Debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. As of April 2, 2011, none of the
conditions allowing holders of the 2.625% Debentures to convert had been met.

The Company has concluded that the 2.625% Debentures are not conventional convertible debt
instruments and that the embedded stock conversion option discussed above qualifies as a
derivative. In addition, the Company has also concluded that the embedded conversion option would
be classified in stockholders’ equity if it were a freestanding instrument. Accordingly, the
embedded conversion option is not required to be accounted for separately as a derivative.

Upon conversion, the Company would pay the holders of the 2.625% Debentures cash up to the
aggregate principal amount of the 2.625% Debentures. If the conversion value exceeds the principal
amount, the Company would deliver shares of its common stock in respect to the remainder of its
conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount (conversion spread).
Accordingly, there would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share
computation for the cash settled portion of the 2.625% Debentures as that portion of the debt
liability will always be settled in cash. The conversion spread will be included in the
denominator for the computation of diluted net income per common share, using the treasury stock
method.

To hedge against potential dilution upon conversion of the 2.625% Debentures, the Company also
purchased call options on its common stock from the hedge counterparties. The call options give the
Company the right to purchase up to 19.8 million shares of its common stock at $30.29 per share.
The Company paid an aggregate of $112.3 million to purchase these call options. The call options
will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity of the 2.625% Debentures or the last day any of the
2.625% Debentures remain outstanding. To reduce the hedging cost, under separate transactions the
Company sold warrants to the hedge counterparties, which give the hedge counterparties the right to
purchase up to 19.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock at $42.91 per share. These
warrants expire on a gradual basis over a specified period starting on September 13, 2017. The
Company received an aggregate of $46.9 million from the sale of these warrants. In accordance to
the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on determining whether an instrument (or embedded
feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock, the Company concluded that the call
options and warrants were indexed to the Company’s stock. Therefore, the call options and warrants
were classified as equity instruments and will not be marked to market prospectively. The net
amount of $65.4 million paid to the hedge counterparties, less the applicable tax benefit related
to the call options of $41.7 million, was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.
The settlement terms of the call options and warrants provide for net share settlement.



3.125% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures

In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00 billion principal amount of 3.125% Debentures to an initial
purchaser in a private offering. The 3.125% Debentures are subordinated in right of payment to the
Company’s existing and future senior debt, including the 2.625% Debentures, and to the other
liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. The 3.125% Debentures were initially convertible,
subject to certain conditions, into shares of Xilinx common stock at a conversion rate of 32.0760
shares of common stock per $1 thousand principal amount of 3.125% Debentures, representing an
initial effective conversion price of approximately $31.18 per share of common stock. The
conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events as outlined in the indenture governing
the 3.125% Debentures but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Due to the accumulation of
cash dividend distributions to common stockholders, the conversion rate for the 3.125% Debentures
was subsequently adjusted to 33.1695 shares of common stock per $1 thousand principal amount of
3.125% Debentures, representing an adjusted conversion price of $30.15 per share at the end of
fiscal 2011.

The Company received net proceeds of $980.0 million from issuance of the 3.125% Debentures, after
deduction of issuance costs of $20.0 million. During fiscal 2009, the Company paid $193.2 million
in cash to repurchase $310.4 million (principal amount) of its 3.125% Debentures, resulting in
approximately $689.6 million of debt outstanding as of April 2, 2011. The debt issuance costs, as
adjusted for the authoritative guidance for the accounting of convertible debentures issued by the
FASB, were recorded in current and non-current assets and are being amortized to interest expense
over 30 years. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15, beginning
on September 15, 2007. However, the Company recognizes an effective interest rate of 7.20% on the
carrying value of the 3.125% Debentures. The effective rate is based on the interest rate for a
similar instrument that does not have a conversion feature. The 3.125% Debentures also have a
contingent interest component that may require the Company to pay interest based on certain
thresholds beginning with the semi-annual interest period commencing on March 15, 2014 (the maximum
amount of contingent interest that will accrue is 0.50% per year) and upon the occurrence of
certain events, as outlined in the indenture governing the 3.125% Debentures.

On or after March 15, 2014, the Company may redeem all or part of the remaining 3.125% Debentures
outstanding for the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest if the closing price of
the Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at
least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on which the
Company provides notice of redemption. Upon conversion, the Company would pay the holders of the
3.125% Debentures cash
value of the applicable number of shares of Xilinx common stock, up to the principal amount of the
3.125% Debentures. If the conversion value exceeds the aggregate principal amount, the Company may
also deliver, at its option, cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock for the
conversion value in excess of the principal amount (conversion spread). Accordingly, there would
be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share computation for the cash
settled portion of the 3.125% Debentures as that portion of the debt instrument will deem to be
settled in cash. The conversion spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of
diluted net income per common share, using the treasury stock method.



Holders of the 3.125% Debentures may convert their 3.125% Debentures only upon the occurrence of
certain events in the future, as outlined in the indenture. In addition, holders who convert their
3.125% Debentures in connection with a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture, may be
entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Furthermore, in
the event of a fundamental change, the holders of the 3.125% Debentures may require Xilinx to
purchase all or a portion of their 3.125% Debentures at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of 3.125% Debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. As of April 2,
2011, none of the conditions allowing holders of the 3.125% Debentures to convert had been met.

The Company concluded that the embedded features related to the contingent interest payments and
the Company making specific types of distributions (e.g., extraordinary dividends) qualify as
derivatives and should be bundled as a compound embedded derivative under the authoritative
guidance for derivatives instruments and hedging activities issued by the FASB. The fair value of
the derivative at the date of issuance of the 3.125% Debentures was $2.5 million and is accounted
for as a discount on the 3.125% Debentures. Due to the repurchase of a portion of the 3.125%
Debentures in fiscal 2009, the carrying value of the derivative was reduced to $1.6 million and
will continue to be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the 3.125% Debentures.
Any change in fair value of this embedded derivative will be included in interest and other income
(expense), net on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The Company also concluded that
the 3.125% Debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock
conversion option qualifies as a derivative. In addition, the Company has concluded that the
embedded conversion option would be classified in stockholders’ equity if it were a freestanding
instrument. Accordingly, the embedded conversion option is not required to be accounted for
separately as a derivative.

Revolving Credit Facility

In April 2007, Xilinx entered into a five-year $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit
facility with a syndicate of banks. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a
benchmark rate plus an applicable margin based upon the Company’s credit rating. In connection
with the credit facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial and nonfinancial
covenants. As of April 2, 2011, the Company had made no borrowings under this credit facility and
was not in violation of any of the covenants.

Note 15. Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation authorized 2.0 million shares of undesignated preferred
stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. The Board of Directors is
authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or
imposed upon any wholly unissued series of preferred stock. As of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010,
no preferred shares were issued or outstanding.

Common Stock and Debentures Repurchase Programs

The Board of Directors has approved stock repurchase programs enabling the Company to repurchase
its common stock in the open market or through negotiated transactions with independent financial
institutions. In February 2008, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $800.0 million of
common stock (2008 Repurchase Program). In November 2008, the Board of Directors approved an
amendment to the Company’s 2008 Repurchase Program to provide that the funds may also be used to
repurchase outstanding debentures. In June 2010, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to
$500.0 million of common stock (2010 Repurchase Program). The 2008 and 2010 Repurchase Programs
have no stated expiration date. Through April 2, 2011, the Company had used the entire amount
authorized under the 2008 Repurchase program and $93.2 million of the $500.0 million authorized
under the 2010 Repurchase Program, leaving $406.8 million available for future repurchases. Of the
$800.0 million used under the 2008 Repurchase Program, $606.8 million was used to repurchase 23.5
million shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock and $193.2 million was used to repurchase
$310.4 million (principal amount) of its 3.125% Debentures. See “Note 14. Convertible Debentures
and Revolving Credit Facility” for additional information about the 3.125% Debentures. The
Company’s current policy is to retire all repurchased shares and debentures, and consequently, no
treasury shares or debentures were held as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010.

During fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 17.8 million shares of common stock in the open market
for a total of $468.9 million under the 2008 and 2010 Repurchase Program. During fiscal 2010, the
Company repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock in the open market for a total of $150.0
million under the 2008 Repurchase Program.

The tax benefits (expenses) associated with stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase
plan recorded in additional paid-in capital were $4.9 million, $(4.4) million and $4.2 million, for
fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

As of April 2, 2011, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $38.0 million. If unused, these carryforwards will expire in 2014 through 2031.
All of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to change of ownership
limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. The Company had
federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $115.3 million, federal
affordable housing tax credit carryforwards of approximately $4.6 million and no other state credit
carryforwards. If unused, $17.1 million of the tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2023 through
2031. The remainder of the credits has no expiration date. Some of the federal and state credit
carryforwards are subject to change of ownership limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code
and similar state provisions. As of April 2, 2011, the Company had foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $2.5 million. The foreign loss carryforwards have an indefinite life
and are subject to loss limitation rules.

Unremitted foreign earnings that are considered to be permanently invested outside the U.S. and on
which no U.S. taxes have been provided, are approximately $1.34 billion as of April 2, 2011. The
residual U.S. tax liability, if such amounts were remitted, would be approximately $433.2 million.

The Company has manufacturing operations in Singapore where the Company has been granted “Pioneer
Status” that is effective through fiscal 2021. The Pioneer Status reduces the Company’s tax on the
majority of Singapore income from 17% to zero. The benefit of Pioneer Status in Singapore for
fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 are approximately $54.8 million ($0.21 per common share),
$18.7 million ($0.07 per common share) and $15.6 million ($0.06 per common share), respectively, on
income considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The tax effect of operations in low tax
jurisdictions on the Company’s overall tax rate is reflected in the table above.

Long-term deferred tax assets of $57.3 million and $63.7 million as of April 2, 2011 and April 3,
2010, respectively, were included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Current
deferred tax liabilities of $404 thousand and zero as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010,
respectively, were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheet.



As of April 2, 2011, gross deferred tax assets were offset by valuation allowances of $17.8
million, $17.2 million of which was associated with state tax credit carryforwards and the
remainder associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards.

If the remaining balance of $79.7 million and $96.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of
April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010, respectively, were realized in a future period, it would result in
a tax benefit of $56.0 million and $66.5 million, respectively, thereby reducing the effective tax
rate.

The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within
the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. The balance of accrued
interest and penalties was $2.2 million and $3.1 million as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010,
respectively. Interest and penalties included in (released from) the Company’s provision for
income taxes totaled $(840) thousand, $(900) thousand and $1.1 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively.

The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal audits by taxing authorities for years through
fiscal 2007. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. state audits for years through fiscal 2004,
except for fiscal years 1996 through 2001 which are still open for audit purposes. The Company is
no longer subject to tax audits in Ireland for years through fiscal 2006.

It is reasonably possible that changes to our unrecognized tax benefits could be significant in the
next twelve months due to tax audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitation. As a result
of uncertainties regarding tax audit settlements and their possible outcomes, an estimate of the
range of increase or decrease that could occur in the next twelve months cannot be made.

On December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit
adjustments for fiscal 2005. The Company began negotiations with the IRS Appeals Division in the
third quarter of fiscal 2010, and settled the remaining proposed adjustment in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2010 with no net change in tax liability. On September 20, 2010, pursuant to
stipulations filed by the Company and the IRS, the Tax Court entered its final order closing all
remaining fiscal 2005 issues. The Company received a small refund and, accordingly, all matters
with the IRS relating to fiscal 2005 are resolved.

The IRS audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Company’s tax returns for fiscal 1996
through 2001. The Company filed petitions with the Tax Court in response to assertions by the IRS
relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. All issues have been settled with the IRS as described
below.

On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options
must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with the
Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement. The Tax
Court entered its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to
the Appeals Court. On May 27, 2009, the Company received a 2-1 adverse judicial ruling from the
Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision and holding that the Company should include stock
option amounts in its cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. As a result, the Company recorded
expense of $8.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 in order to reverse the interest income
it accrued through March 28, 2009 on the earlier prepayment it made to the IRS. In addition, the
Company increased its accrual for penalties and interest in the first quarter from $4.0 million to
$21.9 million. The Company did not agree with the Appeals Court decision and filed a motion for
rehearing on August 12, 2009. On January 13, 2010, the Appeals Court issued an order withdrawing
both the majority and dissent opinions that were issued on May 27, 2009. On March 22, 2010, the
Appeals Court in a 2-1 majority opinion affirmed the Tax Court decision in Xilinx’s favor. As a
result of the March 2010 decision, the Company received a tax refund from the IRS of approximately
$25.2 million and interest of approximately $9.4 million. The accrual for penalties and interest
decreased from $21.5 million in the third quarter to $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2010, primarily as a result of the March 2010 decision. On June 21, 2010, the time for the IRS to
appeal the March 22, 2010 decision to the United States Supreme Court lapsed. As a result, all
issues concerning this matter are closed.



Note 17. Segment Information

Xilinx designs, develops and markets programmable logic semiconductor devices and the related
software design tools. The Company operates and tracks its results in one operating segment.

The IRS audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Company’s tax returns for fiscal 1996
through 2001. The Company filed petitions with the Tax Court in response to assertions by the IRS
relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. All issues have been settled with the IRS as described

Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision; this adverse ruling was later withdrawn on January
13, 2010 after oral arguments. On March 22, 2010, the Appeals Court affirmed the August 30, 2005
Tax Court decision in Xilinx’s favor. On June 21, 2010, the time for the IRS to appeal the March
22, 2010 decision to the United States Supreme Court lapsed. As a result, all issues concerning
this matter are closed.

In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a statutory notice of deficiency
reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal 2005. The Company began negotiations with the IRS
Appeals Division in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, and settled the remaining proposed adjustment
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 with no net change in tax liability. On September 20, 2010,
pursuant to stipulations filed by the Company and the IRS, the Tax Court entered its final order
closing all remaining fiscal 2005 issues. The Company received a small refund and, accordingly,
all matters with the IRS relating to fiscal 2005 are resolved.



Patent Litigation

On December 28, 2007, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG (PACT)
against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division
(PACT XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No. 2:07-CV-563). The lawsuit
pertains to eleven different patents and PACT seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages,
interest and attorneys’ fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to
the Company is estimable at this time.

On July 30, 2010, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by Intellitech against the Company in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Intellitech Corporation v. Altera Corporation,
Xilinx, Inc. and Lattice Semiconductor Corporation Case No. 1:10-CV-00645-UNA). The lawsuit
pertains to a single patent and Intellitech seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified
damages, interest and attorneys’ fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential
exposure to the Company is estimable at this time. On February 15, 2011, the Company filed a
lawsuit against Intellitech in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
(Xilinx, Inc. v. Intellitech Corporation, Case No. CV11-0699). The lawsuit pertains to seven
patents and a single trademark and the Company seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified
damages, costs and attorneys’ fees.

On December 6, 2010, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed by Bala Delay Line, Inc. (Bala
Delay) against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Texarkana
Division (Bala Delay Line, Inc V. Xilinx, Inc., Case No. 5:10-CV-211) (Bala Delay I), and on
January 31, 2011, Bala Delay filed another patent infringement lawsuit against the Company in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division (Bala Delay Line, Inc v.
Xilinx, Inc. and Bonser-Philhower Sales, Inc., Case No. 4:11-CV-46) (Balay Delay II). Both
lawsuits pertained to the same single patent and in each case Bala Delay sought declaratory and
injunctive relief, unspecified damages, interest and attorneys’ fees. The Company has
successfully resolved both lawsuits. Bala Delay I was dismissed by the Court without prejudice on
March 7, 2011 and Bala Delay II was dismissed by the Court without prejudice on March 18, 2011. In
both cases, Bala Delay stipulated that it has no present intent to initiate litigation against any
Xilinx product based on the patent, and subsequent litigation would be brought in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California. No settlement was reached and no payment was made
by the Company to Bala Delay in connection with either dismissal.

On February 14, 2011, the Company filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against Intellectual
Ventures Management LLC and related entities (Intellectual Ventures) in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of California (Xilinx, Inc. v. Invention Investment Fund I LP, Invention
Investment Fund II LLC, Intellectual Ventures LLC, Intellectual Ventures Management LLC,
Intellectual Ventures I LLC and Intellectual Ventures II LLC, Case No. CV11-0671). The lawsuit
pertains to sixteen patents and seeks judgments of non-infringement by Xilinx and judgments that
the patents are invalid and unenforceable, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees.

On February 15, 2011, Intellectual Ventures added the Company as a defendant in its complaint for
patent infringement previously filed against Altera, Microsemi and Lattice Semiconductor
Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Intellectual Ventures I LLC
and Intellectual Ventures II LLC v. Altera Corporation, Microsemi Corporation, Lattice
Semiconductor Corporation and Xilinx, Inc., Case No. 10-CV-1065). The lawsuit pertains to five
patents, four of which Xilinx is alleged to be infringing, and Intellectual Ventures seeks
unspecified damages, interest and attorneys’ fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any
potential exposure to the Company is estimable at this time.

Other Matters

Except as stated above, there are no pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the
Company is a party or of which any of its property is the subject.

Note 19. Business Combinations

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company completed the acquisitions of all of the
outstanding equities of AutoESL, a privately-held company that provides high level synthesis
software tools to deliver the benefits of programmable platforms to a broader base of companies,
and Omiino Ltd. (Omiino), a privately-held company that develops Optical Transport Network IP. The
AutoESL acquisition aligns with Xilinx’s strategy for accelerating market growth, as AutoESL-based
tools will enable more architects and designers to utilize FPGA capabilities, while the Omiino
acquisition supports Xilinx’s effort to meet the increasing demand from our large wired
communications customers to offer application specific IP. These acquisitions were accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting. The aggregate financial impact of these acquisitions was
not material to the Company.



Note 20. Goodwill and Acquisition-Related Intangibles

Note 21. Employee Benefit Plans

Xilinx offers various retirement benefit plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total
contributions to these plans were $8.9 million, $9.3 million and $9.9 million in fiscal 2011, 2010
and 2009, respectively. For employees in the U.S., Xilinx instituted a Company matching program
pursuant to which the Company will match contributions to Xilinx’s 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan)
based on the amount of salary deferral contributions the participant makes to the 401(k) Plan.
Xilinx will match up to 50% of the first 8% of an employee’s compensation that the employee
contributed to their 401(k) account. The maximum Company contribution per year is $4,500 per
employee. As permitted under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 401(k) Plan allows
tax deferred salary deductions for eligible employees. The Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors administers the 401(k) Plan. Participants in the 401(k) Plan may make salary deferrals of
up to 25% of the eligible annual salary, limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the
Internal Revenue Code. Participants who have reached the age of 50 before the close of the plan
year may be eligible to make catch-up salary deferral contributions, up to 25% of eligible annual
salary, limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.

The Company allows its U.S.-based officers, director-level employees and its board members to defer
a portion of their compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan). The Compensation
Committee administers the Plan. As of April 2, 2011, there were approximately 134 participants in
the Plan who self-direct their contributions into investment options offered by the Plan. The Plan
does not allow Plan participants to invest directly in Xilinx’s stock. In the event Xilinx becomes
insolvent, Plan assets are subject to the claims of the Company’s general creditors. There are no
Plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or
minimum return on investments. As of April 2, 2011, Plan assets were $37.6 million and obligations
were $43.2 million. As of April 3, 2010, Plan assets were $32.0 million and obligations were $37.0
million.



REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Xilinx, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xilinx, Inc. as of April 2, 2011
and April 3, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 2, 2011. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Part IV, Item 15(a)(2). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Xilinx, Inc. at April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended April 2, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Xilinx, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 2,
2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 31, 2011
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Xilinx, Inc.

We have audited Xilinx, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2011, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Xilinx, Inc.’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Xilinx, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of April 2, 2011, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Xilinx, Inc. as of April 2, 2011 and
April 3, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 2, 2011 of Xilinx, Inc. and our report
dated May 31, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company’s
management, including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a—15(e) and 15d—15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2011 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a—15(f) and 15d—15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. This system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with
management’s authorization. The design, monitoring and revision of the system of internal control
over financial reporting involve, among other things, management’s judgments with respect to the
relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. The effectiveness of the system
of internal control over financial reporting is supported by the selection, retention and training
of qualified personnel and an organizational structure that provides an appropriate division of
responsibility and formalized procedures. The system of internal control is periodically reviewed
and modified in response to changing conditions.

Because of its inherent limitations, no matter how well designed, a system of internal control over
financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements or all fraud. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring
mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

Management has used the criteria established in the Report ‘

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework’

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to
evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this
evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of April 2, 2011.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 2, 2011
has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

(4)

On July 26, 2006, the stockholders approved the adoption of the 2007 Equity Plan and
authorized 10.0 million shares to be reserved for issuance thereunder. The 2007 Equity Plan,
which became effective on January 1, 2007, replaced both the Company’s 1997 Stock Plan (which
expired on May 8, 2007) and the Supplemental Stock Option Plan. On August 9, 2007, August 14,
2008, August 12, 2009 and August 11, 2010 our stockholders authorized the reserve of an
additional 5.0 million shares, 4.0 million shares, 5.0 million shares and 4.5 million shares

granted as stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or RSUs.

In November 2000, the Company acquired RocketChips. Under the terms of the merger, the
Company assumed all of the stock options previously issued to RocketChips’ employees pursuant
to four different stock option plans. A total of approximately 807 thousand option shares
were assumed by the Company, none of which remained outstanding as of April 2, 2011. These
option shares are excluded from the above table. All of the options assumed by the Company
remain subject to the terms of the RocketChips’ stock option plan under which they were
issued. Subsequent to acquiring RocketChips, the Company has not made any grants or awards
under any of the RocketChips’ stock option plans and the Company has no intention to do so in
the future.

(6)

Under the Supplemental Stock Option Plan, options were granted to employees and consultants
of the Company, however neither officers nor members of our Board were eligible for grants
under the Supplemental Stock Option Plan. Only non-qualified stock options were granted under
the Supplemental Stock Option Plan (that is, options that do not entitle the optionee to
special U.S. income tax treatment) and such options generally expire not later than 12 months
after the optionee ceases to be an employee or consultant. Upon a merger of the Company with
or into another company, or the sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets, each option
granted under the Supplemental Stock Option Plan may be assumed or substituted with a similar
option by the acquiring company, or the outstanding options will become exercisable in
connection with the merger or sale.
