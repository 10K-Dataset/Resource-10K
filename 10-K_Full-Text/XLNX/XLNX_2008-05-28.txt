ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company)
designs, develops and markets complete programmable logic solutions. These
solutions have several components:

Advanced integrated circuits (ICs) in the form of
  programmable logic devices (PLDs);

Software design tools to program the PLDs;

Predefined system functions delivered as
  intellectual property (IP) cores;

Design services;

Customer training; and

Field engineering and technical
  support.

Our PLDs include field programmable
gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) that our
customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our solutions are designed
to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment
manufacturers in end markets such as wired and wireless communications,
industrial, scientific and medical, test and measurement, aerospace and defense,
audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing. We sell
our products globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors and
through direct sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by a network of
independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management
organization.

Xilinx was founded and incorporated in
California in February 1984. In April 1990, the Company reincorporated in
Delaware. Our corporate facilities and executive offices are located at 2100
Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124, and our website address is
www.xilinx.com.

Industry Overview

There are three principal types of ICs
used in most digital electronic systems: processors, which generally are
utilized for control and computing tasks; memory devices, which are used for
storing program instructions and data; and logic devices, which generally are
used to manage the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a
system. Xilinx develops PLDs, a type of logic device. Alternatives to PLDs
include custom gate arrays, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and
application specific standard products (ASSPs). These devices all compete with
each other since they may be utilized in many of the same types of applications
within electronic systems. However, variations in unit pricing, development
cost, product performance, reliability, power consumption, density,
functionality, ease of use and time-to-market determine the degree to which the
devices compete for specific applications.

The primary advantage PLDs have over
custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs is that PLDs enable faster time-to-market
because of their shorter design cycles. Users can program the PLD to implement
their design, using software to create and revise their designs relatively
quickly with lower development costs. PLDs typically have a larger die size
resulting in higher costs per unit compared to custom gate arrays, ASICs and
ASSPs, which are customized to perform a limited fixed function. Custom gate
arrays, ASICs and ASSPs, however, generally offer less flexibility, require
longer fabrication lead times and higher up-front costs than PLDs.

PLDs are standard components. This
means that the same device type can be sold to many different users for many
different applications. As a result, the development cost of PLDs can be spread
over a large number of users. Custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs, on the other
hand, are custom chips for an individual user for use in a specific application.
ASSPs implement specific functions for a limited set of users. This involves a
high up-front cost to users. Technology advances are enabling PLD companies to
reduce costs considerably, making PLDs an increasingly attractive alternative to
custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs.


An overview of typical PLD end market applications
for our products is shown in the following table:

Products

Integral to the success of our business
is the timely introduction of new products that meet customer requirements and
compete effectively with respect to price, functionality and performance.
Software design tools, IP cores, technical support and design services are also
critical components that enable our customers to implement their design
specifications into our PLDs. Altogether, our PLDs and related IP, service and
support form a comprehensive programmable logic solution. A brief
overview of our PLD offerings follows and is not all-inclusive but does comprise
the majority of our


revenues. Some of our more mature
product families have been excluded from the table although they continue to
generate revenues. We operate and track our results in one operating segment for
financial reporting purposes.

Virtex
FPGAs

The Virtex-5 FPGA family consists of 24
devices and is the latest generation Virtex family and the PLD industry’s first
product family manufactured using 65-nanometer (nm) process technology. The
Virtex-5 family consists of four platforms: Virtex-5 LX FPGAs for
logic-intensive designs, Virtex-5 LXT FPGAs for high-performance logic with
serial connectivity, Virtex-5 SXT FPGAs for high-performance digital signal
processing (DSP) with serial connectivity and Virtex-5 FXT FPGAs for embedded
processing with serial connectivity. Within each platform are a number of
offerings, differing primarily in the amount of logic, memory, clock and
input/output (I/O) resources provided. These offerings enable customers to
select the optimal mix of resources for their particular application. Currently,
Xilinx is shipping devices from all platforms. Compared to previous 90-nm Virtex
family products, this product family offers increased performance, density and
features, while reducing dynamic power consumption.

The 17-device Virtex-4 FPGA family
consists of three platforms: LX, SX and FX. Virtex-4 LX FPGAs are optimized for
logic-intensive designs, Virtex-4 SX FPGAs are optimized for high-performance
DSP, and Virtex-4 FX FPGAs are optimized for embedded processing with serial
connectivity. Virtex-4 devices are produced on 90-nm process
technology.

Prior generation Virtex families
include Virtex-II Pro, Virtex-II, Virtex-E and the original Virtex
family.


Spartan FPGAs

The Spartan-3 generation
FPGAs

were the PLD
industry’s first 90-nm FPGAs and were developed as a programmable alternative to
ASICs for new applications in high growth end markets such as consumer,
automotive and low cost networking. The Spartan-3 generation is comprised of
three primary platforms including the original Spartan-3 family, the Spartan-3E
family, and the Spartan-3A family. The Spartan-3E family consists of five
devices and is optimized to deliver the lowest cost per logic cell. The
Spartan-3A family consists of 14 devices and is optimized to deliver the lowest
cost per I/O. In addition, this family has devices targeted for cost sensitive,
high performance signal processing applications and nonvolatile devices
optimized for cost sensitive applications where security and board space are
customer priorities.

Prior generation Spartan families
include Spartan-IIE, Spartan-II, Spartan XL and the original Spartan
family.

EasyPath FPGAs

EasyPath™ FPGAs use the same production
masks and fabrication process as standard FPGAs and are tested to a specific
customer application to improve yield and lower costs. As a result, EasyPath
FPGAs provide customers with significant cost reduction when compared to the
standard FPGA devices without the conversion risk, conversion engineering effort
or the additional time required to move to an ASIC. EasyPath FPGAs are available
for the higher density devices of the Virtex-II, Virtex-II Pro and Virtex-4
families. EasyPath FPGAs will also be available for the higher densities of the
Virtex-5 families. Customers purchasing EasyPath FPGAs must meet certain minimum
order requirements and pay a custom test generation charge.

CPLDs

CPLDs operate on the low end of the
programmable logic density spectrum. CPLDs are single chip, nonvolatile
solutions characterized by instant-on and universal interconnect.

The CoolRunner-II family is the latest
generation Xilinx CPLD family with six devices in production. CoolRunner-II
CPLDs combine the advantages of ultra low power consumption with the benefits of
high performance and low cost. While CoolRunner-II is suitable for a wide
variety of end markets and applications, the ultra low power consumption and
small package profiles of these devices have led to their acceptance in the
growing portable consumer electronics marketplace.

The CoolRunner XPLA3 family was the
first CPLD product to combine very low power consumption with high density logic
and high I/O counts in a single device. This family consists of six
devices.

Prior generation CPLD families include
the XC9500, XC9500XL and XC9500XV which offer low cost, high performance and
in-system programmability for 5.0-volt, 3.3-volt and 2.5-volt systems,
respectively. These families are widely used in communications and industrial
applications.

Research and
Development

Our research and development (R&D)
activities are primarily directed towards the design of new ICs, the development
of new software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software, the
design of IP cores of logic and the adoption of advanced semiconductor
manufacturing processes for ongoing cost reductions, performance and signal
integrity improvements and lowering power consumption. As a result of our
R&D efforts, we have introduced a number of new products during the past
years including the Virtex-5 and Virtex-4 series of FPGAs, and the Spartan-3
FPGA series. Additionally, we have made major enhancements to our IP core
offerings and introduced new versions of our ISE software. To support embedded
processing and DSP design on our platform FPGA devices, the Platform Studio tool
suite and System Generator for DSP have been further enhanced. We extended our
collaboration with our foundry suppliers in the development of 90-nm and 65-nm
complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing technology and we
are the first company in the PLD industry to ship 65-nm devices.

Our R&D challenge is to continue to
develop new products that create cost-effective solutions for customers. In
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, our R&D expenses were $358.1 million, $388.1
million and $326.1 million, respectively. We believe

technical leadership and innovation
are essential to our future success and we are committed to continuing a
significant level of R&D effort.

Sales and
Distribution

We sell our products to OEMs and to
electronic components distributors who resell these products to OEMs or
subcontract manufacturers.

We use dedicated global sales and
marketing organizations as well as independent sales representatives to generate
sales. In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited
number of key accounts with independent sales representatives often addressing
those customers in defined territories. Distributors create demand within the
balance of our customer base. Distributors also provide vendor-managed
inventory, value-added services and logistics for a wide range of our OEM
customers.

Whether Xilinx, the independent sales
representative, or the distributor identifies the sales opportunity, a local
distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders. In
such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they
bear all legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial
goods, such as credit loss, inventory shrinkage and theft, as well as foreign
currency fluctuations, but excluding indemnity and warranty liability.

In accordance with our distribution
agreements and industry practice, we have granted the distributors the
contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic
basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a
subsequent change in list prices. Revenue recognition on shipments to
distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the
distributors’ end customers.


Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes the
substantial majority of our products worldwide. No end customer accounted for
more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. As of March 29,
2008 and March 31, 2007, Avnet accounted for 83% and 86% of the Company’s total
accounts receivable, respectively. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for
61%, 67% and 70% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively. We also use other regional distributors throughout the
world. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific
geographies, as we deem appropriate given the level of business and their
performance. We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching
a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services. Since
PLDs are standard products, they do not present many of the inventory risks to
distributors posed by custom gate arrays, and they simplify the requirements for
distributor technical support. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,”
for information about concentrations of credit risk and Note 15 for information about our revenues from
external customers and domestic and international operations.

Backlog

As of March 29, 2008, our backlog from
OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our distributors
scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $202.0 million, compared
to $190.0 million as of March 31, 2007. Orders from end customers to our
distributors are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation
without significant penalty. As a result, backlogs from both OEM customers and
end customers reported by our distributors as of any particular period may not
be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period.

Wafer Fabrication

As a fabless semiconductor company, we
do not manufacture wafers used for our products. Rather, we purchase wafers from
multiple foundries including United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), Toshiba
Corporation (Toshiba), Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko) and He Jian Technology
(Suzhou) Co., Ltd. Currently, UMC manufactures the substantial majority of our
wafers. Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production
and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined
by our periodic negotiations with the wafer foundries.

Our strategy is to focus our resources
on market development and creating new ICs and software design tools rather than
on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry
relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well
as other suppliers of leading-edge process technologies.

In September 1995, we entered into a
joint venture with UMC and other parties to construct a wafer fabrication
facility in Taiwan, known as United Silicon Inc. (USIC). In January 2000, as a
result of the merger of USIC into UMC, our equity position in USIC was converted
into shares of UMC, which are publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In
fiscal 2007, we sold a portion of our UMC shares and we sold the remaining
shares of our UMC investment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Also see Note
4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.”

In fiscal 1997, we signed a wafer
purchasing agreement with Seiko that was amended in fiscal 1998, 1999 and 2000.
Seiko manufactures wafers for our older, more mature product lines.

In October 2004, the Company entered
into an advanced purchase agreement with Toshiba under which the Company paid
Toshiba a total of $100.0 million in two equal installments for advance payment
of silicon wafers produced under the agreement. The original agreement was
extended to December 2008. The balance of the advance payment remaining was $4.5
million at March 29, 2008.

Sort, Assembly and
Test

Wafers purchased are sorted by the
foundry, independent sort subcontractors, or by Xilinx. Sorted die are assembled
by subcontractors. During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into
individual die, which are then assembled into various package types. Following
assembly, the packaged units are tested by Xilinx personnel at our San Jose,
California, Dublin, Ireland or Singapore facilities or by independent test
subcontractors. We purchase most of our assembly and some of our testing
services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. in Taiwan, Amkor Technology,
Inc. in Korea and the Philippines and STATS ChipPAC Ltd. in
Singapore.

Quality Certification

Xilinx has achieved ISO 9001 quality
certification in our San Jose, California, Dublin, Ireland, Longmont, Colorado, Singapore and
Albuquerque locations. In addition, Xilinx achieved


ISO 14001, TL 9000 and TS 16949
environmental and quality certifications in the San Jose, Dublin and Singapore
locations and TL 9000 and TS16949 quality certifications in the Albuquerque
location.

Patents and Licenses

While our various proprietary
intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe our
business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or
license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. As of March 29, 2008,
we held 1,785 issued United States patents relating to our products, which vary
in duration. We maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in
the areas of, but not limited to, software, IC architecture, system design,
testing methodologies and other technologies relating to PLDs. We intend to
vigorously protect our intellectual property. We believe that failure to enforce
our intellectual property rights (for example, patents, copyrights and
trademarks) or failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In the
future, we may incur litigation expenses to enforce our intellectual property
rights against third parties. However, any such litigation may or may not be
successful.

We have acquired various software
licenses that permit us to grant sublicenses to our customers for certain third
party software programs licensed with our software design tools. In addition, we
have licensed certain software for internal use in product design. We are also
licensed under certain third party patents and have provided some third parties
licenses under Company patents.

Employees

As of March 29, 2008, we had 3,415
employees compared to 3,353 at the end of the prior fiscal year. None of our
employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work
stoppages and believe we maintain good employee relations.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The following risk factors and other
information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully
considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks
to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the
Company or that the Company’s management currently deems immaterial also may
impair its business operations. If any of the risks described below were to
occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could
be materially adversely affected.

The semiconductor industry is
characterized by cyclical market patterns and a significant industry downturn
could adversely affect our operating results

.

The semiconductor industry is highly
cyclical and our financial performance has been affected by downturns in the
industry. The down cycles are generally characterized by price erosion and
weaker demand for our products. Weaker demand for our products resulting from
economic conditions in the end markets we serve and reduced capital spending by
our customers can result in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding
inventory write-downs. We attempt to identify changes in market conditions as
soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market make prediction of and
timely reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our
past results are much less reliable predictors of the future than with companies
in older, more stable industries.

The nature of our business makes our
revenues difficult to predict which could have an adverse impact on our
business.

In addition to the challenging market
conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the demand for our
products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends
upon our products being designed into our end customer’s products and those
products achieving market acceptance. Due to the complexity of our products, the
design to production process requires a substantial amount of time, frequently
longer than a year. In addition, we are increasingly dependent upon “turns,”
orders received and turned for shipment in the same quarter and we have
historically derived a significant portion of our quarterly revenue during the
last weeks of the quarter. These factors make it difficult for us to forecast
future sales and project quarterly revenues. The difficulty in forecasting
future sales impairs our ability to project our inventory requirements, which
could result in inventory write-downs or failure to meet customer requirements.
In addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues compromises our ability to
provide forward-looking revenue and earnings guidance.

Global economic conditions, the
economic conditions of the countries in which we operate and currency
fluctuations could negatively impact our financial condition and results of
operations.

We derive a substantial portion of our
revenues from international sales. International sales accounted for
approximately 61% of our net revenues in fiscal 2008, and 60% and 59% of our net
revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. We also have significant
international operations, including foreign sales offices to support our
international customers and distributors and our regional headquarters in
Ireland and Singapore. Sales and operations outside of the U.S. subject us to
the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory
environments. Our financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we
do significant business or by changes in foreign currency exchange rates
affecting those countries. For example, we have sales and operations in the Asia
Pacific region, Japan and Europe. Past economic weakness in these markets
adversely affected revenues, and such conditions may occur in the future. Sales
to all direct OEMs and distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars. While the
recent movement of the Euro and Yen against the U.S. dollar had no material
impact to our business, increased volatility could impact our European and
Japanese customers. Currency instability may increase credit risks for some of
our customers and may impair our customers' ability to repay existing
obligations. Increased currency volatility could also positively or negatively
impact our foreign currency denominated costs, assets and liabilities.
Furthermore, because we are increasingly dependent on the global economy,
instability in worldwide economic environments occasioned, for example, by
political instability, terrorist activity or U.S. military actions could impact
economic activity and lead to a contraction of capital spending by our
customers. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations in the future.


We are subject to the risks associated
with conducting business operations outside of the U.S. which could adversely
affect our business.

In addition to international sales and
support operations, we purchase our wafers from foreign foundries and have our
commercial products assembled, packaged and tested by subcontractors located
outside the U.S. All of these activities are subject to the uncertainties
associated with international business operations, including tax laws and
regulations, trade barriers, economic sanctions, import and export regulations,
duties and tariffs and other trade restrictions, changes in trade policies,
other foreign governmental regulations, reduced protection for IP, longer
receivable collection periods and disruptions or delays in production or
shipments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and/or operating results. Additional factors that could
adversely affect us due to our international operations include rising oil
prices and increased costs of natural resources. Moreover, our financial
condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political
conflicts or economic crises in countries where our main wafer providers, end
customers and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and test services
worldwide, are located. Adverse change to the circumstances or conditions of our
international business operations could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Our success depends on our ability to
develop and introduce new products and failure to do so would have a material
adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our success depends in large part on our
ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer requirements
and compete effectively on the basis of price, density, functionality, power
consumption and performance. The success of new product introductions is
dependent upon several factors, including:

timely completion of new product designs;

ability to generate new design opportunities or “design
  wins”;

availability of specialized field application engineering
  resources supporting demand creation and customer adoption of new
  products;

ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process
  technologies on circuit geometries of 65nm and smaller;

achieving acceptable yields;

ability to obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer
  foundries and assembly subcontractors;

ability to obtain advanced packaging;

availability of supporting software design tools;

utilization of predefined IP cores of logic;

customer acceptance of advanced features in our new products;
  and

successful deployment of electronic systems by our
  customers.

Our product development efforts may not be
successful, our new products may not achieve industry acceptance and we may not
achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per unit
cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to
decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result,
we may be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from design wins for our
newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our
current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and
corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on
introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other
price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining
consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product
introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our
products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our
financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

We are dependent on independent
foundries for the manufacture of all of our products and a manufacturing problem
or insufficient foundry capacity could adversely affect our
operations.

During fiscal 2008, nearly all of our
wafers were manufactured either in Taiwan, by UMC or in Japan, by Toshiba or
Seiko. Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the
pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by
periodic negotiations between Xilinx and these wafer foundries, which usually
result in short-term agreements that do not provide for long-term supply or
allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries, especially UMC,
which supplies the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on UMC to produce
wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes. These attributes
include an ability to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies
and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields, and deliver them
in a timely manner. We cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our
wafers will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the
realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies or difficulties due
to limitations of new and


existing process technologies.
Furthermore, we cannot guarantee our foundries will be able to manufacture
sufficient quantities of our products. Any manufacturing problem or insufficient
foundry capacity could disrupt our operations.

We have established other sources of wafer
supply for our products in an effort to secure a continued supply of wafers.
However, establishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry relationships
requires the investment of management resources as well as additional costs. If
we do not manage these relationships effectively, it could adversely affect our
results of operations.

Increased costs of wafers and
materials, or shortages in wafers and materials, could adversely impact our
gross margins and lead to reduced revenues.

If greater demand for wafers produced by
the foundries is not offset by an increase in foundry capacity, or market demand
for wafers or production and assembly materials increases, our supply of wafers
and other materials could become limited. Such shortages raise the likelihood of
potential wafer price increases and wafer shortages or shortages in materials at
our production and test facilities. Such increases in wafer prices or materials
could adversely affect our gross margins and shortages of wafers and materials
would adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands.

Earthquakes and other natural disasters
could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse affect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

The independent foundries, upon which we
rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California and Singapore
facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other
natural disasters. UMC’s foundries in Taiwan and Toshiba’s and Seiko’s foundries
in Japan as well as many of our operations in California are centered in areas
that have been seismically active in the recent past and some areas have been
affected by other natural disasters. Any catastrophic event in these locations
will disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing activities. This type
of disruption could result in our inability to manufacture or ship products,
thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of
operations. Additionally, disruption of operations at these foundries for any
reason, including other natural disasters such as typhoons, fires or floods, as
well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas
or water could cause delays in shipments of our products, and could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We are dependent on independent
subcontractors for most of our assembly and test services and unavailability or
disruption of these services could negatively impact our financial condition and
results of operations.

We are also dependent on subcontractors to
provide semiconductor assembly, substrate, test and shipment services. Any
prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost
attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, any disruption in assembly, test
or shipment services, or any other circumstance that would require us to seek
alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material adverse
effect on our ability to meet customer demands. These factors would result in
reduced net revenues and could negatively impact our financial condition and
results of operations.

If we are not able to successfully
compete in our industry, our financial results and future prospects will be
adversely affected.

Our PLDs compete in the logic IC industry,
an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid
technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and
continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD
competitors, Altera Corporation, Lattice Semiconductor Corporation and
Actel Corporation, from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the
inception of FPGAs, from the ASSP market, and from new companies that may enter
the traditional programmable logic market segment. We believe that important
competitive factors in the logic industry include:

product pricing;

time-to-market;

product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption
  and density;

field upgradability;

adaptability of products to specific applications;

ease of use and functionality of software design
tools;

availability and functionality of predefined IP cores of
  logic;

inventory management;

access to leading-edge process technology and assembly
  capacity; and

ability to provide timely customer service and
  support.


Our strategy for expansion in the logic
market includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address
high-volume, low-cost and low-power applications as well as high-performance,
high-density applications. In addition, we anticipate continued price reductions
proportionate with our ability to lower the cost for established products.
However, we may not be successful in achieving these strategies.

Other competitors include manufacturers
of:

high-density programmable logic products
  characterized by FPGA-type architectures;

high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements
  for ASICs and ASSPs;

ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded
  programmable logic;

high-speed, low-density CPLDs;

high-performance DSP devices;

products with embedded processors;

products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; and

other new or emerging programmable logic
products.

Several companies have introduced products
that compete with ours or have announced their intention to enter the PLD market
segment. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our
financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

The benefits of programmable logic have
attracted a number of competitors to the market segment. We recognize that
different applications require different programmable technologies, and we are
developing architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer
needs. Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we
have developed common software design tools that support the full range of our
IC products. We believe that automation and ease of design are significant
competitive factors in the PLD market segment.

We could also face competition from our
licensees. In the past we have granted limited rights to other companies with
respect to certain of our older technology, and we may do so in the future.
Granting such rights may enable these companies to manufacture and market
products that may be competitive with some of our older products.

Our failure to protect and defend our
intellectual properly could impair our ability to compete
effectively.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trade
secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We
cannot provide assurance that such intellectual property rights can be
successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or
challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have
asserted against us patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to
technologies that are important to us. Third parties may assert infringement
claims against our indemnitees or us in the future. Assertions by third parties
may result in costly litigation or indemnity claims and we may not prevail in
such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third
parties on commercially reasonable terms. Any infringement claim,
indemnification claim, or impairment or loss of use of our intellectual property
could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

Considerable amounts of our common
shares are available for issuance under our equity incentive plans and
debentures, and significant issuances in the future may adversely impact the
market price of our common shares.

As of March 29, 2008, we had 2.00 billion
authorized common shares, of which 280.5 million shares were outstanding. In
addition, 68.9 million common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to our
equity incentive plans and 1990 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (Employee
Stock Purchase Plan), and 32.1 million shares were reserved for issuance upon
conversion or repurchase of the 3.125% convertible debentures due March 15, 2037
(debentures). The availability of substantial amounts of our common shares
resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity awards outstanding under our
equity incentive plans or the conversion or repurchase of debentures using
common shares, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders, could adversely
affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our
ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity
securities.

We rely on information technology
systems, and failure of these systems to function properly could result in
business disruption.

We rely in part on various information
technology (IT) systems to manage our operations including financial reporting
and we regularly evaluate these systems and make changes to improve them as
necessary. Consequently, we periodically implement new, or enhance existing,
operational and IT systems, procedures and controls. Any delay in the
implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems,
procedures or controls, could harm our ability to record and


report financial and management
information on a timely and accurate basis. Further, these systems are subject
to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failure. Failure
of our IT systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business
disruption.

If we do not successfully manage the
transitions associated with our new management, our ability to compete could be
adversely affected.

On January 7, 2008, we announced the
appointment of Moshe N. Gavrielov as our new President and CEO concurrent with
the retirement of Willem P. Roelandts from these positions. Our new CEO has made
organizational changes, including changes to our management team and may make
future changes to our Company’s structure. It is important for us to
successfully manage these transitions as our failure to do so could adversely
affect our ability to compete effectively.

If we are unable to maintain effective
internal controls, our stock price could be adversely affected.

We are subject to the ongoing internal
control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act).
Our controls necessary for continued compliance with the Act may not operate
effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness disclosure. The
identification of material weaknesses in internal control, if any, could
indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements and
could cause investors to lose confidence and our stock price to drop. Further,
our internal control effectiveness may be impacted if we are unable to retain
sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the
increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.

Unfavorable results of legal
proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operating
results.

From time to time we are subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of
our business. Certain claims are not yet resolved, including those that are
discussed in Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," and additional claims may arise in the
future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty.
Regardless of its merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to
our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management
attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid these risks.
Should the Company fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of
these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be
faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that
would materially and adversely affect a portion of our business and might
materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

We are exposed to fluctuations in
interest rates and changes in credit rating and in the market values of our
portfolio investments which could adversely impact our financial condition and
results of operations.

Our cash, short-term and long-term
investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating and
even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements and financial
market conditions. Since September 2007, the global credit markets have
experienced adverse conditions due to the increased concerns related to the U.S.
sub-prime mortgage market that have negatively impacted the values of various
types of investment and non-investment grade securities. As of March 29, 2008,
approximately 4% of our investment portfolio consisted of AAA-rated auction rate
securities which are secured primarily by pools of student loans originated
under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) that are guaranteed by
the U. S. Department of Education. These securities experienced failed auctions
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 due to liquidity issues in the global
credit markets. In a failed auction, the interest rates are reset to a maximum
rate defined by the contractual terms for each security. We have collected and
expect to collect all interest payable on these securities when due. As of March
29, 2008, the securities were reclassified from short-term to long-term
investments on the consolidated balance sheet to reflect the securities’ final
maturity dates since there can be no assurance of a successful auction in the
future. The auction rate securities described above are a type of asset-backed
securities. All other asset-backed securities comprised less than 5% of our
investment portfolio as of March 29, 2008 and were all AAA rated with the
exception of approximately $37.0 million of asset-backed securities that were
downgraded in April 2008 to AA or A rating. These asset-backed securities are
secured primarily by bank, finance and insurance company obligations,
collateralized loan and bank obligations, mortgage-backed securities with no
direct sub-prime exposure and credit card debt. Substantially all of the other
mortgage-backed securities in the investment portfolio are AAA rated, were
issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies and represented
less than 9% of the portfolio as of March 29, 2008. As a result of these recent
adverse conditions in the global credit markets, there is a risk that we may
incur other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of investments
such as asset-backed securities should the credit markets experience further
deterioration. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due
to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair values of our debt and
equity securities is judged to be other-than-temporary. Furthermore, we may
suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have
declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or financial market
conditions. Please see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, included
in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional
information about our investments.


Our products could have quality
problems which could result in reduced revenues and claims against
us.

We develop complex and evolving
products that include both hardware and software. Despite our testing efforts
and those of our subcontractors, defects may be found in existing or new
products. These defects may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and
repair or replacement costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel
from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with customers.
Product defects or other performance problems could result in the delay or loss
of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business. Our
customers could also seek damages from us for their losses. A product liability
claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming
and costly to defend. Product liability risks are particularly significant with
respect to aerospace, automotive and medical applications because of the risk of
serious harm to users of these products. Any product liability claim, whether or
not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the
efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our
business.

In preparing our financial
statements, we make good faith estimates and judgments that may change or turn
out to be erroneous.

In preparing our financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, we must make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical
accounting policies. Those estimates and judgments have a significant impact on
the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The most
difficult estimates and subjective judgments that we make concern valuation of
marketable and non-marketable securities, revenue recognition, inventories,
long-lived assets, taxes, legal matters and stock-based compensation. We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. We also have other key
accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application
would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but
which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Actual
results may differ materially from these estimates. If these estimates or their
related assumptions change, our operating results for the periods in which we
revise our estimates or assumptions could be adversely and perhaps materially
affected.

We depend on distributors, primarily
Avnet, to generate a majority of our sales and complete order fulfillment.

We rely on distributors throughout the
world to assist us in demand creation, technical support, order processing and
order fulfillment. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 61% of the
Company’s worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2008 and as of March 29, 2008, Avnet
accounted for 83% of our accounts receivable. If a key distributor such as Avnet
materially defaults on a contract or fails to perform, our business and
financial results would suffer.

Reductions in the average selling
prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross margins.

The average selling prices of our
products generally decline as the products mature. We seek to offset the
decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost
reductions and increased unit sales. However, there is no guarantee that our
ongoing efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline
in selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in
revenues and have a negative effect on our gross margins.

A number of factors can impact our
gross margins.

A number of factors, including our
product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing
dynamics, geographic and/or market segment pricing strategies and various
manufacturing cost variables cause our gross margins to fluctuate. In addition,
forecasting our gross margins is difficult because the majority of our business
is based on turns within the same quarter.

ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

Internal Revenue Service

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited
and issued proposed adjustments to the Company’s tax returns for fiscal 1996
through 2001. The Company filed petitions with the Tax Court in response to
assertions by the IRS relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. To date, all issues
have been settled with the IRS in this matter except as described in the
following paragraph.

On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued
its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in
the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with the
Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing
agreement, and thus, the Company had no tax, interest, or penalties due for this
issue. The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006,
the IRS appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit.
The Company and the IRS presented oral arguments to a three-judge panel of the
Appeals Court on March 12, 2008. If the Company were to lose on appeal, the
amount due to the IRS would be approximately $39.3 million. Of that amount, $6.2
million would be an expense to the consolidated statement of income and the
remaining $33.1 million would be an adjustment to additional paid-in capital.
The Company would also be required to reverse $7.6 million of interest income
accrued to date on prepayments to the IRS.

Patent Litigation

On December 28, 2007, a patent
infringement lawsuit was filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG (PACT) against the
Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall
Division (PACT XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No.
2:07-CV-563). The lawsuit pertains to eight different patents and PACT seeks
injunctive relief, unspecified damages and interest and attorneys’ fees. Neither
the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to the Company is
estimable at this time.

On August 21, 2007, a patent infringement
lawsuit was filed by Lonestar Inventions, L.P. (Lonestar) against Xilinx in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division (Lonestar
Inventions, L.P. v. Xilinx, Inc. Case No. 6:07-CV-393). The lawsuit pertains to
a single patent and Lonestar seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages and
interest and attorneys’ fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any
potential exposure to the Company is estimable at this time.

Other Matters

From time to time, we are involved in
various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our
business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property,
mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract


law, tax, distribution arrangements,
employee relations and other matters. Periodically, we review the status of each
matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from
any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible
losses can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal
proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to
predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best
information available at the time. As additional information becomes available,
we continue to reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and
litigation and may revise estimates.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE
OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of
security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this
report.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in
Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Cautionary Statement

The statements in this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis that are forward looking, within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and
uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for
many reasons, including those risks discussed under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere
in this document. Often, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use
of forward-looking words, such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,”
“believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “continue,” “plan,” “intend,” “project” and
other similar terminology, or the negative of such terms. We disclaim any
responsibility to update or revise any forward-looking statement provided in
this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for any reason.

Nature of Operations

We design, develop and market complete
programmable logic solutions, including advanced ICs, software design tools,
predefined system functions delivered as IP cores, design services, customer
training, field engineering and technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs and
CPLDs. These devices are standard products that our customers program to perform
desired logic functions. Our products are designed to provide high integration
and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets
such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical, test and
measurement, aerospace and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer,
automotive and data processing. We sell our products globally through
independent domestic and foreign distributors and through direct sales to OEMs
by a network of independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales
management organization.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The methods, estimates and judgments we
use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact
on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has
defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to
make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need
to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this
definition, our critical accounting policies include: valuation of marketable
and non-marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity
securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the
recording of revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of
revenues and gross margin. Our critical accounting policies also include: the
assessment of impairment of long-lived assets including acquisition-related
intangibles, which impacts their valuation; the assessment of the recoverability
of goodwill, which impacts goodwill impairment; accounting for income taxes,
which impacts the provision or benefit recognized for income taxes, as well as
the valuation of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet,
and valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation, which impacts gross
margin, R&D expenses, and selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
expenses. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and
judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as
subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make
estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could
significantly affect our financial reporting.

Valuation of
Marketable and Non-marketable Securities

The Company’s short-term and long-term
investments include marketable debt and equity securities and non-marketable
equity securities. At March 29, 2008, the Company had marketable debt securities
with a fair value of $1.50 billion, non-marketable equity securities in private
companies of $22.6 million (adjusted cost) and a marketable equity security with
a fair value of $822 thousand.

The fair values for marketable debt and
equity securities are determined by independent pricing sources that value the
securities based on quoted market prices and pricing models except for failed
auction rate securities for which the Company determined their fair value at
March 29, 2008 based on internal analyses. In determining if and when a decline
in market value below adjusted cost of marketable debt and equity securities is
other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates on an ongoing basis the market
conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition and other key measures for
our investments. We assess other-than-temporary impairment of debt and equity
securities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff
Position (FSP) No. FAS 115-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment
and


Its Application to Certain
Investments.” We have not recorded any other-than-temporary impairment for
marketable debt and equity securities for fiscal 2008 or 2007.

In determining whether a decline in
value of non-marketable equity investments in private companies is
other-than-temporary, the assessment is made by considering available evidence
including the general market conditions in the investee’s industry, the
investee’s product development status, the investee’s ability to meet business
milestones and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the individual
investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash and the
investee’s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation. When a
decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company recognizes an
impairment loss in the current period’s operating results to the extent of the
decline.

Revenue Recognition

Sales to distributors are made under
agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under
certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are
deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors’ end
customers. For fiscal 2008, approximately 83% of our net revenues were from
products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract
manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor
that product has been sold to the distributor’s end customer. Also reported by
the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment
information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on
hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. We maintain system
controls to validate distributor data and to verify that the reported
information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects
the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin
expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from
the Company. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory
is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from
Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under
normal payment terms.

Revenue from sales to our direct
customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a
sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection
of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer
acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of
the periods presented, there were no formal acceptance provisions with our
direct customers.

Revenue from software licenses is
deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year.
Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed.
Revenue from Support Products, which includes software and services sales, was
less than 7% of net revenues for all of the periods presented.

Allowances for end customer sales
returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending
customer returns or allowances.

Valuation of Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of
actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or market
(estimated net realizable value). The valuation of inventory requires us to
estimate excess or obsolete inventory as well as inventory that is not of
saleable quality. We review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate
current actual manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for
product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of actual spending over
actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the cyclicality of the
market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, we write down
inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These
factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new
product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates
that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future demand that we use
in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts,
which are also consistent with our short-term manufacturing plans. If our demand
forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to
reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down
additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on our gross
margin.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Including
Acquisition-Related Intangibles

Long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment
if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed
on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held
for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets.
In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the
recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated
fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to
the assets or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held
for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate positive cash
flows.


When assets are removed from operations
and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying
value of the assets over their fair value. Factors affecting impairment of
assets held for sale include market conditions. Changes in any of these factors
could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for
use or assets held for sale.

Goodwill

As required by SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142), goodwill is not amortized but is
subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators
of potential impairment exist, and goodwill is written down when it is
determined to be impaired. We perform an annual impairment review in the fourth
quarter of each fiscal year and compare the fair value of the reporting unit in
which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds
the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired. For
purposes of impairment testing under SFAS 142, Xilinx operates as a single
reporting unit. We use the quoted market price method to determine the fair
value of the reporting unit. Based on the impairment review performed during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal
2008. Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for
goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
To date, no impairment indicators have been identified.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Xilinx is a multinational corporation
operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. We must determine the allocation of
income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions and
apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. We undergo routine
audits by taxing authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and
the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often
require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax
adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with
different tax rates.

In determining income for financial
statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and
in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which
arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement
recognition of revenue and expense. Additionally, we must estimate the amount
and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or deficiency notices
issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities’ positions and our
assessment can change over time resulting in a material effect on the provision
for income taxes in periods when these changes occur.

We must also assess the likelihood that
we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely,
we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve in the form of a
valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not
ultimately be recoverable.

The Company has elected to adopt the
alternative transition method provided in FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition
Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
Awards” for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to
SFAS 123(R). The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to
establish the beginning balance of the APIC pool related to the tax effects of
employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the
APIC pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of
employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of
SFAS 123(R).

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48).” The provisions were
effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. See
Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.

Stock-Based Compensation

In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we
adopted SFAS 123(R), which requires the measurement at fair value and
recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards.
Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of
stock-based awards at the date of grant requires judgment. We use the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock
options and rights to purchase shares under the Company’s Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Option pricing
models, including the Black-Scholes model, also require the use of input
assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected
dividend rate, expected forfeiture rate and expected risk-free rate of return.
We use implied volatility based on traded options in the open market as we
believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better
indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the
appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered: the volume of market
activity of traded options, and determined there was sufficient market activity;
the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those
of options granted by the Company, such as date of grant


and the exercise price, and determined
the input assumptions were comparable; and the length of term of traded options
used to derive implied volatility, which is generally one to two years and which
was extrapolated to match the expected term of the employee options granted by
the Company, and determined the length of the option term was reasonable. The
expected life of options granted is based on the historical exercise activity as
well as the expected disposition of all options outstanding. We will continue to
review our input assumptions and make changes as deemed appropriate depending on
new information that becomes available. Higher volatility and expected lives
result in a proportional increase to stock-based compensation determined at the
date of grant. The expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return
do not have as significant an effect on the calculation of fair
value.

In addition, SFAS 123(R) requires us to
develop an estimate of the number of stock-based awards which will be forfeited
due to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate
have an effect on reported stock-based compensation, as the effect of adjusting
the rate for all expense amortization after April 1, 2006 is recognized in the
period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual forfeiture rate is
higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to
increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the
expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is
lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease
the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense
recognized in the financial statements. The effect of forfeiture adjustments in
fiscal 2008 and 2007 was insignificant. The expense we recognize in future
periods could also differ significantly from the current period and/or our
forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates.

The relatively flat net revenues in
fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was driven by strong customer demand for our
New Products which was offset by decreased demand for our Mainstream and Base
Products, particularly in the Communications and Data Processing end markets.
Increased total unit sales during fiscal 2008 compared to the comparable prior
year period were offset by declines in average unit selling prices, which also
contributed to the flat net revenues in fiscal 2008. The increase in net
revenues from $1.73 billion in fiscal 2006 to $1.84 billion in fiscal 2007 was
due to strong demand for our New Products and growth in the Consumer and
Automotive and Industrial and Other end markets. The increase in net revenues in
fiscal 2007 resulted from increased unit sales, partially offset by normal
declines


in average unit selling prices. See
“Net Revenues by Product” and “Net Revenues by End Markets” for more information
on our product and end-market categories.

No end customer accounted for more than
10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented

Net Revenues by Product

We classify our product offerings into
four categories: New, Mainstream, Base and Support Products. These product
categories, excluding Support Products, are modified on a periodic basis to
better reflect advances in technology. The most recent adjustment was made on
July 2, 2006, which was the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2007.
Amounts for the prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the
new categorization. New Products, as currently defined, include our most recent
product offerings and include the Virtex-5, Virtex-4, Spartan-3, and
CoolRunner-II product families. Mainstream Products include the Virtex-II,
Spartan-II, CoolRunner and Virtex-E product families. Base

Products consist of our
mature product families and include the Virtex, Spartan, XC4000 and XC9500
products. Support Products make up the remainder of our product offerings and
include configuration solutions (serial PROMs), software, IP cores, customer
training, design services and support.

Net revenues by product categories for

Net revenues from New Products
increased significantly in fiscal 2008 and now represent one-third of our total
net revenues. New Products consist primarily of our 65-nm, high-performance and
high-density Virtex-5 family and our 90-nm products, which include the Virtex-4
family, and our high-volume, low-cost Spartan-3 families. These products, along
with our CoolRunner-II family of CPLDs, contributed to the majority of the
revenue growth in New Products in fiscal 2008 and 2007. We expect sales of New
Products to continue to increase over time as more customers’ programs go into
volume production with our 65-nm and 90-nm products.

Net revenues from Mainstream Products
declined in fiscal 2008 and 2007 primarily due to reduced sales from older
products manufactured on 150-nm and 180-nm process technologies including
Spartan-II, Virtex-E and Virtex-II. The decrease in net revenues for this
product category resulted from both a decline in units sold as well as in
average selling prices.

The decline in net revenues from Base
Products in fiscal 2008 and 2007 was expected because the average selling price
continued to decline as these products matured and approached end of
life.

Net revenues from Support Products
increased in fiscal 2008 and 2007 due to modest increases in sales from our
software products.

Net Revenues by End Markets

Our end market revenue data is derived
from our understanding of our end customers’ primary markets. We classify our
net revenues by end markets into four categories: Communications, Industrial and
Other, Consumer and Automotive, and Data Processing. The percentage change
calculation in the table below represents the year-to-year dollar change in each
end market.

Net revenues by end markets for the

Net revenues from Communications, our
largest end market, decreased in fiscal 2008 compared with the prior year period
due to a decline in sales in wireless communications applications, much of which
was driven by merger and consolidation activity in that market. In fiscal 2007,
the Communications end market decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2006 due
primarily to a decline in wired telecommunications applications.

Net revenues from the Industrial and
Other end market increased in fiscal 2008 and 2007 compared with the prior year
periods. The increases were driven by broad-based strength across all
applications including defense, industrial, scientific and medical and test and
measurement.

Net revenues from the Consumer and
Automotive end market increased in fiscal 2008 compared with the prior year
period primarily due to strength in automotive applications. In fiscal 2007, the
increase in net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market was driven
by broad-based strength across all applications, including consumer, automotive
and audio, video and broadcast.

The decline in net revenues from the
Data Processing end market in fiscal 2008 was driven by decreases in sales from
storage, computing and data processing applications. In fiscal 2007, net
revenues from the Data Processing end market declined due primarily to weakness
in the storage business.

Net revenues in North America decreased
in fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decline in sales from wireless communications
as well as data processing applications. The fiscal 2007 increase was driven
primarily by strength in the Industrial and Other end market, particularly
defense applications.

Net revenues in Asia Pacific grew
double-digits in fiscal 2008 due to broad-based end market strength, with
particular strength coming from customers in the Communications and Industrial
and Other end markets. Additionally, Asia Pacific sales continued to benefit
from outsourcing of manufacturing operations by large U.S. and European-based
customers to the Asia Pacific region. The fiscal 2007 increase was due to
increased sales from communications and consumer applications as well as
continued outsourcing of manufacturing operations to the Asia Pacific region by
some of our larger OEM customers.

Net revenues in Europe decreased in
fiscal 2008 due primarily to lower sales from wireless communications
applications. Net revenues in fiscal 2007 increased primarily due to strength
from communications and industrial applications, particularly wireless
infrastructure and industrial, scientific and medical applications.

Net revenues in Japan declined in
fiscal 2008 due to broad-based weakness across all end market categories. The
fiscal 2007 decline was primarily due to a weakened telecommunications
infrastructure market during the year.

The increase in the gross margin
percentage in fiscal 2008 from the comparable prior year period was driven
primarily by product cost reductions and improved operational efficiency. This
favorable impact was partially offset by the product mix effect of New Product
growth year-over-year. New Products generally have lower gross margins than
Mainstream and


Base Products in the early product life
cycle due to higher unit costs resulting from lower yields. As a percentage of
total net revenues, New Product sales increased by approximately 10% from fiscal
2007 to fiscal 2008.

The decline in the gross margin
percentage in fiscal 2007 from the comparable prior year period was partially
due to the effect of stock-based compensation expense of $10.3 million resulting
from our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective April 2, 2006. Stock-based
compensation expense was zero for fiscal 2006. In addition, the impact of the
production ramp of our 90-nm process and the significant growth in the New
Products category also contributed to the decline of gross margin. New Products
represented 23% of net revenues in fiscal 2007 compared to 12% of net revenues
in the comparable prior year period.

Gross margin may be adversely affected
in the future due to mix shifts, competitive-pricing pressure,
manufacturing-yield issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate these risks
by continuing to improve yields on our New Products and by improving
manufacturing efficiency with our suppliers.

Sales of inventory previously written
off were not material during fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006.

In order to compete effectively, we
pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the form of reduced
prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is
common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture
and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost.
We have historically been able to offset much of this revenue decline in our
mature products with increased revenues from newer products.

R&D spending decreased $30.0
million or 8% during fiscal 2008 compared to the same period last year. The
decrease was primarily due to reduced stock-based compensation expense and lower
mask and wafer spending, coupled with lower cost related to our R&D center
in India. R&D spending increased $62.0 million or 19% during fiscal 2007
compared to fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily related to stock-based
compensation expense of $41.6 million resulting from our adoption of SFAS 123(R)
effective April 2, 2006 and expenses related to investments in resources to
support new product development, particularly in the area of DSP. Stock-based
compensation expense was zero for fiscal 2006.

We plan to continue to selectively
invest in R&D efforts in areas such as new products and more advanced
process development, IP cores and the development of new design and layout
software. We will also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for
technology leadership and engineering resources in critical areas.

to lower stock-based compensation expense, reduced discretionary spending and
lower sales commissions. The reductions in discretionary spending included
consulting, travel and marketing expenses. SG&A expenses increased 19%
during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. This increase was attributable to
stock-based compensation expense of $38.3 million resulting from our adoption of
SFAS 123(R) effective April 2, 2006, expenses related to increased headcount,
particularly in our sales organization, and legal related costs. Stock-based
compensation expense was zero for fiscal 2006.

Amortization expense was related to the

these intangible assets decreased for fiscal 2008 from the same period last
year, due to the complete amortization of certain intangible assets in fiscal
2007. Amortization expense for these intangible assets increased for fiscal 2007
from fiscal 2006 due to the acquisition of AccelChip in January 2006.

We expect amortization of
acquisition-related intangibles to be approximately $5.3 million for fiscal 2009
compared with $6.8 million for fiscal 2008.

Litigation Settlements and
Contingencies

On November 27, 2006, the Company
settled a patent infringement lawsuit under which the Company agreed to pay $6.5
million. The plaintiff agreed to dismiss the patent infringement lawsuit with
prejudice, granted a patent license to the Company and executed an agreement not
to sue the Company under any patent owned or controlled by the plaintiff for ten
years. As a result of the settlement agreement, we recorded a current period
charge of $2.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining
balance of $4.0 million represented the value of the prepaid patent license
granted as part of the settlement. This balance is being amortized over the
patent’s remaining useful life.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2006,
the Company accrued an additional $3.2 million that represented the settlement
payment for litigation related to an agreement with a sales representative. The
Company accrued amounts that represented anticipated payments for liability for
legal contingencies under the provisions of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies.”

We adopted SFAS 123(R) under the
modified prospective transition method, effective beginning in fiscal 2007.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we accounted for stock-based compensation
under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees," (APB 25) and related interpretations, using the intrinsic
value method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for
employee stock options. The 28% decrease in stock-based compensation expense for
fiscal 2008 was due to a decrease in the number of shares granted, declining
weighted-average fair values of stock awards vesting and lower expense related
to a methodology change from accelerated to straight-line amortization in
connection with the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Total stock-based compensation
expense during fiscal 2007 related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) was $90.3
million, excluding one-time expense of $2.2 million relating to prior years
under the provisions of APB 25.

In June 2006, stockholder derivative
complaints were filed against the Company concerning the Company’s historical
option-granting practices and the SEC initiated an informal inquiry on the
matter. An investigation of the Company’s historical stock option-granting
practices was conducted by outside counsel and no evidence of fraud, management
misconduct or manipulation in the timing or exercise price of stock option
grants was found. The investigation determined that in nearly all cases, stock
options were issued as of pre-set dates; however, there were some minor
differences between the recorded grant dates and measurement dates for certain
grants made between 1997 and 2006. As a result, a $2.2 million charge was taken
to the Company’s earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Subsequently the
SEC informal inquiry was terminated and no enforcement action was recommended
and the stockholder derivative complaints were dismissed.

The income tax effect of the charge
resulted in a benefit of $650 thousand, which was recorded to income tax
expense. The Company assessed the implications of applicable income tax rules
that may affect the Company. The tax benefit recorded is net of such potential
costs.

Write-Off of Acquired In-Process
Research and Development

In connection with the acquisition of
AccelChip in January 2006, $4.5 million of in-process R&D costs were written
off. The projects identified as in-process would have required additional effort
in order to establish technological feasibility. These projects had identifiable
technological risk factors indicating that successful completion, although
expected, was not assured. If an identified project is not successfully
completed, there is no alternative future use for the project, therefore,


the expected future income will not be
realized. The acquired in-process R&D represented the fair value of
technologies in the development stage that had not yet reached technological
feasibility and did not have alternative future uses.

The acquired in-process R&D
components consist of algorithmic synthesis software and IP libraries for
high-performance DSP design in FPGAs. We plan to sell these products to new and
existing Xilinx customers and over time integrate them with our existing DSP
software products. These projects were approximately 45% complete at the time of
acquisition and we expected to complete all of the development projects by the
end of fiscal 2009 with an estimated cost to complete of $3.5 million. As of
March 29, 2008, these projects were approximately 85% complete and we still
expect to complete all of the development projects by the end of fiscal 2009
with a remaining estimated cost to complete of $1.0 million.

To determine the value of AccelChip’s
in-process R&D, the expected future cash flow attributable to the in-process
technology was discounted, taking into account the percentage of completion,
utilization of pre-existing “core” technology, risks related to the
characteristics and applications of the technology, existing and future markets,
and technological risk associated with completing the development of the
technology. We expensed these non-recurring charges in the period of
acquisition. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The decrease in interest and other, net
in fiscal 2008 over the prior year was due to the interest expense ($32.0
million) related to the debentures issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007
as well as a loss of approximately $4.7 million from the sale of the Company’s
remaining UMC investment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. These decreases
were partially offset by an increase in interest income of $13.6 million in
fiscal 2008 over the prior year due to higher yields resulting from investing in
taxable securities and a larger investment portfolio. The increase in interest
and other, net in fiscal 2007 over the prior year was due to higher yields from
our investments, resulting from an increase in interest rates, and contributing
to an increase of $23.6 million in interest income. The increase was also
attributable to an increase of approximately $4.2 million in dividend income
from the UMC investment compared to the prior year and a gain of approximately
$7.0 million from the sale of a portion of the Company’s UMC investment which
was partially offset by portfolio capital losses. The increase in fiscal 2007
was also offset by interest expense related to the debentures of $2.2 million
for fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we began liquidating our investments with
low interest rate yields (e.g., tax-exempt municipal bonds) and investing in
taxable securities such as floating rate notes, which had a higher rate of
return than the tax-exempt municipal bonds. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial

The effective tax rates in all years
reflected the favorable impact of foreign income at statutory rates less than
the United States rate and tax credits earned.


The increase in the effective tax rate
in fiscal 2008, when compared with fiscal 2007, was primarily due to items
unique to fiscal 2007 reducing the rates for the prior year period. The decrease
in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was related to an
increase in the amount of R&D tax credits recognized and an increase in the
proportion of net income earned in lower tax jurisdictions. The Company also
benefited from a decrease in tax reserves in fiscal 2007 due to expiration of
the federal statute of limitations for fiscal 2003. These benefits were
partially offset by non-deductible stock-based compensation resulting from the
adoption of SFAS 123(R).

The IRS examined the Company’s tax
returns for fiscal 1996 through 2001. All issues have been settled with the
exception of issues related to Xilinx U.S.’s cost sharing arrangement with
Xilinx Ireland. On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning
whether the value of stock options must be included in the cost sharing
agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed with the Company that no
amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement.
Accordingly, there are no additional taxes, penalties or interest due for this
issue. The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25, 2006,
the IRS appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Company
is opposing this appeal as it believes that the Tax Court decided the case
correctly. The Company and the IRS presented oral arguments to a three-judge
panel of the Appeals Court on March 12, 2008. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”
and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8.
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources

We have historically used a combination
of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing to support ongoing
business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary
technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common
stock under our stock repurchase program, pay dividends and finance working
capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities are available for
future sale.

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and
Long-term Investments

The combination of cash, cash
equivalents and short-term and long-term investments at March 29, 2008 and March
31, 2007 totaled $1.86 billion and $1.81 billion, respectively. As of March 29,
2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.30 billion
and working capital of $1.48 billion. Cash provided by operations of $581.0
million for fiscal 2008 was $29.4 million higher than the $551.6 million
generated during fiscal 2007. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2008
resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items,
decreases in inventories and prepaid expenses and increases in income taxes
payable and deferred income on shipments to distributors which were partially
offset by an increase in accounts receivable.

The decrease in prepaid expenses in
fiscal 2008 was primarily related to the utilization of the advance wafer
purchase payment paid to Toshiba. In October 2004, we entered into an advanced
purchase agreement with Toshiba under which the Company paid Toshiba a total of
$100.0 million for advance payment of silicon wafers produced under the
agreement, which expired in December 2006 and has since been extended until
December 2008. The entire advance payment of $100.0 million is being reduced by
future wafer purchases from Toshiba. At March 29, 2008, the unused balance of
the advance payment remaining was $4.5 million.

Net cash provided by investing
activities was $192.0 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to net cash used
in investing activities of $283.8 million in fiscal 2007. Net cash provided by
investing activities during fiscal 2008 consisted of $232.2 million of net
proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities, including
$47.1 million of net proceeds from the sale of the remaining UMC investment, and
a distribution from UMC of $10.7 million. These items were partially offset by
$45.6 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further
discussion below) and $5.3 million of other investing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities
was $541.9 million in fiscal 2008, as compared to $415.3 million in fiscal 2007.
Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2008 consisted of $550.0
million for the repurchase of common stock and $140.0 million for dividend
payments to stockholders. These items were partially offset by $125.6 million of
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $22.5
million for excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Accounts

Receivable

Accounts receivable, net of allowances
for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments
increased 37% from $182.3 million at the end of fiscal 2007 to $249.1 million at
the end of fiscal 2008. Days sales outstanding increased to 49 days at March 29,
2008 from 36 days at March 31, 2007. The increases were primarily


attributable to the timing of payments from customers, credit
issuance and the timing of shipments during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2008.

Inventories

Inventories decreased from $174.6
million at March 31, 2007 to $130.3 million at March 29, 2008. The combined
inventory days at Xilinx and distribution channel decreased to 94 days at March
29, 2008, compared to 112 days at March 31, 2007. The decreases were primarily
due to improved forecasting accuracy and fewer inventory mix issues.

We attempt to maintain sufficient
levels of inventory in various product, package and speed configurations in
order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand.
Conversely, we also attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with
maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for
cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process
advancements. We continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide
excellent customer response at a competitive cost.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

During fiscal 2008, we invested $45.6
million in property, plant and equipment compared to $110.8 million in fiscal
2007. Primary investments in fiscal 2008 were for computer equipment, software,
test equipment, and building and leasehold improvements. The decrease in fiscal
2008 was primarily attributable to the accumulated construction costs incurred
in fiscal 2007 in connection with our Asia Pacific regional headquarters
building in Singapore, which was completed in June 2007, and the purchase in
February 2007 of a parcel of land for $28.6 million near our headquarters in San
Jose for future potential growth purposes, neither of which was repeated in
fiscal 2008. We do not intend to build on the land at this time. We expect that
property, plant and equipment expenditures will decrease in the future due to
expense controls.

Current Liabilities

Current liabilities increased from
$303.4 million at the end of fiscal 2007 to $340.7 million at the end of fiscal
2008. The increase was primarily due to the increases in deferred income on
shipments to distributors and accrued payroll and related liabilities, which
were partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable. The increase in
deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to an increase in
distributor inventories at March 29, 2008 compared to the prior year.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stockholders’ equity decreased $100.9
million during fiscal 2008, from $1.77 billion in fiscal 2007 to $1.67 billion
in fiscal 2008. The decrease in stockholder’s equity was attributable to the
repurchase of common stock of $550.0 million, the payment of dividends to
stockholders of $140.0 million and unrealized losses on available-for-sale
securities, net of deferred tax benefits, of $1.8 million. The decreases were
partially offset by net income of $374.0 million for fiscal 2008, the issuance
of common stock under employee stock plans of $124.7 million, stock-based
compensation related amounts totaling $65.8 million, the related tax benefits
associated with stock option exercises and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of
$15.8 million, the effect of the adoption of FIN 48 totaling $6.5 million,
cumulative translation adjustment of $3.1 million and hedging transaction gains
totaling $1.0 million.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and
Long-term Investments

The combination of cash, cash
equivalents and short-term and long-term investments at March 31, 2007 and April
1, 2006 was $1.81 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2007,
we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.14 billion and
working capital of $1.40 billion. Cash provided by operations of $551.6 million
for fiscal 2007 was $62.2 million higher than the $489.4 million generated
during fiscal 2006. Cash provided by operations for fiscal 2007 resulted
primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items, decreases in
accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses and an increase in income
taxes payable (net of reclassifications), which were partially offset by
increases in deferred income taxes and other assets, and decreases in accrued
liabilities and deferred income on shipments to distributors.

The decrease in prepaid expenses in
fiscal 2007 was primarily related to the utilization of the advance wafer
purchase payment paid to Toshiba. In October 2004, we entered into an advanced
purchase agreement with Toshiba under which the Company paid Toshiba a total of
$100.0 million for advance payment of silicon wafers produced under the
agreement, which expired in December 2006 and has since been extended until
December 2008. The entire advance payment of $100.0 million is being reduced by
future wafer purchases from Toshiba.


At March 31, 2007, the unused balance of the
advance payment remaining was $40.0 million.

Net cash used in investing activities
was $283.8 million during fiscal 2007, as compared to net cash provided by
investing activities of $242.4 million in fiscal 2006. Net cash used in
investing activities during fiscal 2007 consisted of $171.4 million of net
purchases of available-for-sale securities, $110.8 million for purchases of
property, plant and equipment (see further discussion below) and $1.6 million of
other investing activities. The net purchases of available-for-sale securities
during fiscal 2007 were primarily due to the portfolio mix of our short- and
long-term security investments.

Net cash used in financing activities
was $415.3 million in fiscal 2007, as compared to $397.8 million in fiscal 2006.
Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2007 consisted of $1.43
billion for the repurchase of common stock and $120.8 million for dividend
payments to stockholders. These items were primarily offset by $980.0 million of
net proceeds from the issuance of the debentures and $128.1 million of proceeds
from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.

Accounts

Receivable

Accounts receivable, net of allowances
for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments
decreased 6% from $194.2 million at the end of fiscal 2006 to $182.3 million at
the end of fiscal 2007. Days sales outstanding decreased to 36 days at March 31,
2007 from 41 days at April 1, 2006. The decreases were primarily attributable to
strong collections during fiscal 2007 that were partially offset by increased
shipments.

Inventories

Inventories decreased from $201.0
million at April 1, 2006 to $174.6 million at March 31, 2007. The combined
inventory days at Xilinx and distribution channel decreased to 112 days at March
31, 2007, compared to 145 days at April 1, 2006. The decreases were primarily
due to improved production yields (which lower our per-unit inventory costs),
inventory mix and greater visibility to our customers’ forecast and production
requirements.

Property, Plant and Equipment

During fiscal 2007, we invested $110.8
million in property, plant and equipment compared to $67.0 million in fiscal
2006. Primary investments in fiscal 2007 were for computer equipment, IT
equipment, test equipment, building and leasehold improvements, and land. The
increase in fiscal 2007 was also attributable to the accumulated construction
costs of the building in Singapore, which was completed in June 2007, and our
purchase in February 2007 of a parcel of land for $28.6 million near our
headquarters in San Jose for future potential growth purposes.

Current Liabilities

Current liabilities decreased from
$345.0 million at the end of fiscal 2006 to $303.4 million at the end of fiscal
2007. The decrease was primarily due to the decreases in deferred income on
shipments to distributors and other accrued liabilities, which were partially
offset by the increases in accounts payable and accrued payroll and related
liabilities. The decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors was
due to lower inventory in the distributor channel as distributors attempted to
adjust their inventory level to align with end-customer demand and to reduce
inventory carrying costs.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stockholders’ equity decreased $956.1
million during fiscal 2007, from $2.73 billion in fiscal 2006 to $1.77 billion
in fiscal 2007. The decrease in stockholder’s equity was a result of the $1.43
billion repurchase of our common stock, $120.8 million of dividend payments to
stockholders and $12.2 million decrease in other comprehensive income primarily
due to a decrease in the fair market value of the UMC investment. The decrease
was partially offset by net income of $350.7 million for fiscal 2007, the
proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of $125.8
million and the effect of stock-based compensation expense and associated tax
benefits of $130.4 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash generated from operations is used
as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Our investment
portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $250.0
million revolving credit facility entered into in April 2007. There have been no
borrowings to date under our existing revolving credit facility. We also have a
shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an
indeterminate amount of debt, equity and other securities.


We used $550.0 million of cash to
repurchase 23.5 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2008 compared with
$1.43 billion used to repurchase 55.2 million shares in fiscal 2007. In the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we received net proceeds of $980.0 million from
the issuance of convertible debentures. As part of the $1.43 billion of stock
repurchases in fiscal 2007, $930.0 million of the net proceeds from the
debentures was used to repurchase 34.6 million shares of our common stock.
During fiscal 2008, we paid $140.0 million in cash dividends to stockholders,
representing an aggregate amount of $0.48 per common share. During fiscal 2007,
we paid $120.8 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing an
aggregate amount of $0.36 per common share. On February 25, 2008, our Board of
Directors declared an increase in the dividend rate on our common stock from
$0.12 to $0.14 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The
dividend is payable on May 28, 2008. Our stock repurchase program and dividend
policy could be impacted by, among other items, our views on potential future
capital requirements relating to R&D, investments and acquisitions, legal
risks, principal and interest payments on our debentures and other strategic
investments.

We anticipate that existing sources of
liquidity and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash
needs for the foreseeable future. However, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A
included in Part I and below could affect our cash positions adversely. In
addition, as a result of recent adverse conditions in the global credit markets,
certain types of investments such as asset-backed securities may present risks
arising from liquidity and/or credit concerns. In the event these investments
become illiquid, the Company does not expect this will materially affect its
liquidity and capital resources or results of operations. We will continue to
evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity,
procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities, development of new
products, and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could
complement our business.

significant contractual obligations at March 29, 2008 and the effect such

      financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and
      Supplementary Data,” for additional information about our
      debentures.

Due to the inherent uncertainty with
respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized
tax benefits at March 29, 2008, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of
cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. Therefore, $39.1 million
of unrecognized tax benefits classified as long-term income taxes payable in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 29, 2008, have been excluded
from the contractual obligations table above.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

As of March 29, 2008, we did not have
any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii)
of SEC Regulation S-K.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for
measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies
to other pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements; it does
not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (fiscal
2009 for Xilinx), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 for financial assets and financial
liabilities to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of
operations. Additionally, in February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157-1,
“Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other
Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of
Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13” (FSP 157-1) and FSP No.
157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (FSP 157-2). FSP 157-1 removes
leasing from the scope of SFAS 157 and FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of
SFAS 157 from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 for all non-financial assets and
non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The
Company is currently evaluating the impact that SFAS 157 will have on its
financial condition and results of operations when it is applied to
non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities beginning in the first
quarter of fiscal 2010.

See Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” for additional information about other recent accounting
pronouncements.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk
relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of fixed income
securities with a fair value of approximately $1.50 billion at March 29, 2008.
Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while
preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. The portfolio includes
municipal bonds, floating rate notes, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed
securities, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds,
auction rate securities and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities.
In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit
quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based
upon the issuer’s credit rating. These securities are subject to interest rate
risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A
hypothetical 100 basis-point (one percentage point) increase or decrease in
interest rates compared to rates at March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007 would have
affected the fair value of our investment portfolio by less than $9.0 million
and $8.0 million, respectively.

Credit Market Risk

Since September 2007, the global credit
markets have experienced adverse conditions due to the increased concerns
related to the U.S. sub-prime mortgage market that have spread to other sectors
of the U.S. economy. This has negatively impacted the values of various types of
investment and non-investment grade securities. As a result of these recent
adverse conditions in the global credit markets, there is a risk that the
Company may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain types of
investments such as asset-backed securities should the credit markets experience
further deterioration. Please see Note 5 to our consolidated financial
statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,”
for additional information about our investments.


Foreign Currency Exchange
Risk

Sales to all direct OEMs and
distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Gains and losses on foreign currency
forward contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated transactions, for
which a firm commitment has been attained and the hedged relationship has been
effective, are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same
period that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any
instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses
in the consolidated statements of income as they are incurred.

We enter into forward currency exchange
contracts to hedge our overseas operating expenses and other liabilities when
deemed appropriate. As of March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007, we had the
following outstanding forward currency exchange contracts:

(In
      thousands and U.S. dollars)

$

38,940

$

21,211

The net unrealized gain or loss, which
approximates the fair market value of the above contracts, was immaterial at
March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007. The contracts expire at various dates between
April and June 2008.

Our investments in several of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
As the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated at each quarter
end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign
currency and the U.S. dollar increase or decrease the value of those
investments. These fluctuations are recorded within stockholders' equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Other foreign-denominated
assets and liabilities are revalued on a monthly basis with gains and losses on
revaluation reflected in net income. A hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable
change in foreign currency exchange rates at March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007
would have affected the annualized foreign-currency denominated operating
expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by less than $15.0 million and $14.0
million, respectively. In addition, a hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable
change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at March 29, 2008
and March 31, 2007 would have affected the value of foreign-currency denominated
cash and investments by less than $6.0 million and $4.0 million,
respectively.

TATEMENTS

Note 1. Nature of Operations

Xilinx designs, develops and markets
complete programmable logic solutions, including advanced integrated circuits,
software design tools, predefined system functions delivered as intellectual
property cores, design services, customer training, field engineering and
technical support. The wafers used to manufacture its products are obtained
primarily from independent wafer manufacturers located in Taiwan and Japan. The
Company is dependent on these foundries to produce and deliver silicon wafers on
a timely basis. The Company is also dependent on subcontractors, primarily
located in the Asia Pacific region, to provide semiconductor assembly, test and
shipment services. Xilinx is a global company with manufacturing and test
facilities in the United States, Ireland and Singapore and sales offices
throughout the world. The Company derives over one-half of its revenues from
international sales, primarily in Europe, Japan and the Asia Pacific region.

Note 2. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Xilinx and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
after elimination of all intercompany transactions. The Company uses a 52- to
53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2008 was a
52-week year ended on March 29, 2008. Fiscal 2007 was a 52-week year ended on
March 31, 2007. Fiscal 2006 was a 52-week year ended on April 1, 2006. Fiscal
2009 will be a 52-week year ending on March 28, 2009.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to, among
others, the useful lives of assets, assessment of recoverability of property,
plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, inventory write-downs,
allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, potential reserves
relating to litigation and tax matters, valuation of certain investments and
derivative financial instruments as well as other accruals or reserves. Actual
results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to
the financial statements.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three
months or less. These investments consist of commercial paper, bank certificates
of deposit, money market funds and time deposits. Short-term investments consist
of municipal bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign
government and agency securities, floating rate notes, mortgage-backed
securities, asset-backed securities and bank certificates of deposit with
original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than
one year from the balance sheet date. Prior to March 29, 2008, short-term
investments also included taxable and tax-advantaged auction rate securities.
Long-term investments consist of U.S. and foreign government and agency
securities, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed
securities, floating rate notes and municipal bonds with remaining maturities
greater than one year, unless the investments are specifically identified to
fund current operations, in which case they are classified as short-term
investments. As of March 29, 2008, long-term investments also included
approximately $71.9 million of AAA-rated auction rate securities that
experienced failed auctions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. These auction
rate securities are secured primarily by pools of student loans originated under
FFELP that are guaranteed by the U. S. Department of Education. Equity
investments are also classified as long-term investments since they are not
intended to fund current operations.

The Company maintains its cash balances
with various banks with high quality ratings, and investment banking and asset
management institutions. The Company manages its liquidity risk by investing in
a variety of money market funds, high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds,
municipal bonds and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. This
diversification of investments is consistent with its policy to maintain
liquidity and ensure the ability to collect principal. The Company maintains an
offshore investment portfolio denominated in U.S. dollars with investments in
non-U.S. based issuers. All investments are made pursuant to corporate
investment policy guidelines. Investments include Euro commercial paper, Euro
dollar bonds, Euro dollar floating rate notes and offshore time deposits.


Management classifies investments as
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and re-evaluates
such designation at each balance sheet date, although classification is not
generally changed. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the
Company has the positive intent and the ability to hold the securities until
maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at cost adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such
amortization, as well as any interest on the securities, is included in interest
income. No investments were classified as held-to-maturity at March 29, 2008 or
March 31, 2007. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the
unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, included as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and
losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on
available-for-sale securities are included in interest and other, net. The fair
values for marketable debt and equity securities are determined by independent
pricing sources that value the securities based on quoted market prices and
pricing models except for failed auction rate securities for which the Company
determined their fair value at March 29, 2008 based on internal analyses. The
cost of securities matured or sold is based on the specific identification
method.

Xilinx adopted the provisions of FSP
115-1 on January 1, 2006. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the
Company assessed other-than-temporary impairment of debt and equity securities
in accordance with FSP 115-1. In determining whether a decline in value of
non-marketable equity investments in private companies is other-than-temporary,
the assessment is made by considering available evidence including the general
market conditions in the investee’s industry, the investee’s product development
status, the investee’s ability to meet business milestones and the financial
condition and near-term prospects of the individual investee, including the rate
at which the investee is using its cash and the investee’s need for possible
additional funding at a lower valuation. When a decline in value is deemed to be
other-than-temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current
period’s operating results to the extent of the decline.

Accounts Receivable

The allowance for doubtful accounts
reflects the Company’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts
receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on the aging of
Xilinx’s accounts receivable, historical experience, known troubled accounts,
management judgment and other currently available evidence. Xilinx writes off
accounts receivable against the allowance when Xilinx determines a balance is
uncollectible and no longer actively pursues collection of the receivable.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of
actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method), or market
(estimated net realizable value) and are comprised of the following:

The Company reviews and sets standard
costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. The Company's
manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full
absorption of actual spending over actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity.
Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product
lifecycles, the Company writes down inventory based on forecasted demand and
technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic
conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in
strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements.
Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a
material effect on recorded inventory values.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are
recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for financial
reporting purposes is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets of three to five years for machinery, equipment,
furniture and fixtures and 15 to 30 years for buildings. Depreciation expense
totaled $54.2 million, $56.0 million and $53.3 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquisition-Related Intangibles

The Company evaluates the carrying
value of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held
and used for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment
indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When


indicators of impairment exist and
assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows
attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be
sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written
down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash
flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals. When assets are removed
from operations and held for sale, Xilinx estimates impairment losses as the
excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value.

Goodwill

As required by SFAS 142, goodwill is
not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more
frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based
approach. All other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful
lives and assessed for impairment under SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Based on the impairment review
performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, there was no impairment of
goodwill in fiscal 2008. Unless there are indicators of impairment, the
Company’s next impairment review for goodwill will be performed and completed in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. To date, no impairment indicators have been
identified.

Revenue Recognition

Sales to distributors are made under
agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under
certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are
deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors’ end
customers. For fiscal 2008, approximately 83% of Xilinx’s net revenues were from
products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract
manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor
that product has been sold to the distributor’s end customer. Also reported by
the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment
information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on
hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. The Company maintains
system controls to validate distributor data and to verify that the reported
information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects
the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin
expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from
the Company. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory
is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from
Xilinx at which point Xilinx has a legally enforceable right to collection under
normal payment terms.

Revenue from sales to Xilinx’s direct
customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a
sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection
of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer
acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of
the periods presented, there were no formal acceptance provisions with Xilinx’s
direct customers.

Revenue from software licenses is
deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year.
Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed.
Revenue from support products, which includes software and services sales, was
less than 7% of net revenues for all of the periods presented.

Allowances for end customer sales
returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending
customer returns or allowances.

Foreign Currency Translation

The U.S. dollar is the functional
currency for the Company’s Ireland and Singapore subsidiaries. Assets and
liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured
into U.S. dollars, and the resulting gains or losses are included in the
consolidated statements of income under interest and other, net. The
remeasurement gains or losses were immaterial for fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006.

The local currency is the functional
currency for each of the Company’s other wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries.
Assets and liabilities are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars
at month-end exchange rates and statements of income are translated at the
average monthly exchange rates. Exchange gains or losses arising from
translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities (i.e.,
cumulative translation adjustment) are included as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Derivative Financial Instruments

To reduce financial risk, the Company
periodically enters into financial arrangements as part of the Company’s ongoing
asset and liability management activities. Xilinx uses derivative financial
instruments to hedge fair values of underlying assets and liabilities or future
cash flows which are exposed to foreign currency, equity and interest rate
fluctuations. The


Company does not enter into derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. As of March 29, 2008
and March 31, 2007, the Company had the following outstanding forward currency
exchange contracts:

The net unrealized gain or loss, which

March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007. The contracts expire at various dates between
April and June 2008.

The $1.00 billion debentures include
provisions which qualify as embedded derivatives. Please see Note 12 below for
detailed discussion about the embedded derivatives. The embedded derivatives
were separated from the debentures and their fair value was established at the
inception of the debentures. Any subsequent change in fair value of the embedded
derivatives would be recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of income.
The fair value of the embedded derivatives at inception of the debentures was
$2.5 million and it changed to $2.3 million and $2.1 million at March 29, 2008
and March 31, 2007, respectively. The change in the fair value of the embedded
derivatives of approximately $200 thousand and $400 thousand during fiscal 2008
and 2007, respectively, was recorded as a charge or a credit to interest
expense, as applicable, on the Company’s consolidated statements of
income.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development costs are
charged to expense as incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has equity incentive plans
that are more fully discussed in Note 3. Effective April 2, 2006, the Company
adopted SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires the Company to measure the cost of all
employee equity awards that are expected to be exercised based on the grant-date
fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over
the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange
for the award (generally over the vesting period of the award). SFAS 123(R)
addresses all forms of stock-based payment awards, including shares issued under
employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock
appreciation rights. In addition, the Company is required to record compensation
expense (as previous awards continue to vest) for the unvested portion of
previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company accounted for stock-based
compensation under APB 25 and related interpretations, using the intrinsic value
method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for employee
stock options. Prior to adopting SFAS 123(R), the Company presented all tax
benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in
its statements of cash flows. SFAS 123(R) requires cash flows resulting from
excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing
activities. Excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions
for exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock
compensation costs for such options. In addition, the Company provided the
required pro forma disclosures related to its stock plans in accordance with
SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123) as amended by
SFAS No. 148 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure”
(SFAS 148). The exercise price of employee stock options is equal to the market
price of Xilinx common stock (defined as the closing trading price reported by
The NASDAQ Global Select Market) on the date of grant. Additionally, Xilinx’s
employee stock purchase plan is deemed a compensatory plan under SFAS 123(R).
Accordingly, the employee stock purchase plan is included in the computation of
stock-based compensation expense.

The Company applies SFAS 123(R) using
the modified-prospective method and consequently has not retroactively adjusted
results for prior periods. Under the modified-prospective method, the
compensation cost recognized by the Company beginning in fiscal 2007 includes
(a) compensation cost for all stock-based awards granted prior to, but not yet
vested as of April 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and (b) compensation cost
for all stock-based awards granted subsequent to April 1, 2006, based on the
grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
123(R). The Company uses the straight-line attribution method to recognize
stock-based compensation costs over the requisite service period of the award
for stock-based awards granted after April 1, 2006. For stock-based awards
granted prior to April 2, 2006, the Company continues to use the accelerated
amortization method consistent with the amounts disclosed in the pro forma
disclosure as prescribed by SFAS 123. Upon exercise, cancellation or expiration
of stock options, deferred tax assets for options with multiple vesting dates
are eliminated for each vesting period on a first-in, first-out basis as if each
award had a separate vesting period. To calculate


the excess tax benefits available for
use in offsetting future tax shortfalls as of the date of implementation, the
Company followed the alternative transition method discussed in FSP 123(R)-3.

Income Taxes

All income tax amounts reflect the use
of the liability method

under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS
109)

.

Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting
purposes

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48). The interpretation contains
a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax
position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence
indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on
audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more
than 50% likely of being ultimately realized. FIN 48 requires that the
cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 shall be recorded as an adjustment to the
opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity
or net assets on the balance sheet. The Company adopted FIN 48 effective April
1, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2008. See Note 14 for additional information
relating to the adoption of FIN 48.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value
in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
SFAS 157 applies to other pronouncements that require or permit fair value
measurements; it does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007 (fiscal 2009 for Xilinx), and interim periods within those
fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 for financial
assets and financial liabilities to have a material effect on its financial
condition and results of operations. Additionally, in February 2008, the FASB
issued FSP No. 157-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement
No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements
for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13” (FSP
157-1) and FSP No. 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (FSP
157-2). FSP 157-1 removes leasing from the scope of SFAS 157 and FSP 157-2
delays the effective date of SFAS 157 from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 for all
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis (at least annually). The Company is currently evaluating the impact that
SFAS 157 will have on its financial condition and results of operations when it
is applied to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities beginning in
the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”
(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
elected be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 was
effective for Xilinx on March 30, 2008 and the Company has made no elections to
measure any financial instruments or certain other assets at fair
value.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141(R)) which replaces
SFAS No. 141. SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an
acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable
assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141(R) also establishes disclosure
requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the
business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective as of the beginning of an
entity's fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008 (fiscal 2010 for
Xilinx). The adoption of SFAS 141(R) will change the Company’s accounting
treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2010.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an
amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" (SFAS 160). The objective of
this statement is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of
the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated
financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary. SFAS 160 requires reclassifying noncontrolling interests, also
referred to as minority interests, as a component of equity upon adoption. SFAS
160 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's fiscal year that begins
after December 15, 2008 (fiscal 2010 for Xilinx). As of March 29, 2008, Xilinx
did not have any minority interests. The adoption of SFAS 160 will not have any
effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.


In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.
161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133), to provide an enhanced understanding of an
entity’s use of derivative instruments, how they are accounted for under SFAS
133 and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related
hedged items on the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash
flows. SFAS 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008 (fiscal 2010 for Xilinx).
The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of SFAS
161 on its financial condition and results of operations.

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No.
APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in
Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (FSP APB 14-1). The
Company’s 3.125% convertible debentures due March 15, 2037 will be affected by
this FSP. FSP APB 14-1 will require the issuer to separately account for the
liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the
issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in
subsequent periods. Further, the FSP will require bifurcation of a component of
the debt, classification of that component in equity, and then accretion of the
resulting discount on the debt as part of interest expense being reflected in
the statement of income. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2008 and will be required to be applied retrospectively to
all periods presented. The Company will be required to implement the standard
during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which begins on March 29, 2009. The
Company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FSP APB 14-1
will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.

Product
Warranty and Indemnification

The Company generally sells products
with a limited warranty for product quality. The Company provides an accrual for
known product issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The
warranty accrual and related provision for fiscal 2007 is predominately due to
two quality issues, one related to a single vendor and another due to a
settlement payment with one of the Company’s customers. The following table
presents a reconciliation of the Company's product warranty liability, which is
included in other accrued liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets:

The Company offers, subject to certain
terms and conditions, to indemnify certain customers and distributors for costs
and damages awarded against these parties in the event the Company’s hardware
products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights,
including patents, copyrights or trademarks. To a lesser extent, the Company may
from time-to-time offer limited indemnification with respect to its software
products. The terms and conditions of these indemnity obligations are limited by
contract, which obligations are typically perpetual from the effective date of
the agreement. The Company has historically received only a limited number of
requests for indemnification under these provisions and has not made any
significant payments pursuant to these provisions. The Company cannot estimate
the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, that the Company may be
required to make as a result of these obligations due to the limited history of
indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to
be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. However,
there can be no assurances that the Company will not incur any financial
liabilities in the future as a result of these obligations.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Avnet distributes the substantial
majority of the Company’s products worldwide. As of March 29, 2008 and March 31,
2007, Avnet accounted for 83% and 86% of the Company’s total accounts
receivable, respectively. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for 61%, 67%
and 70% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its distributors and
believes their sales to diverse end customers and to diverse geographies further
serve to mitigate the Company’s exposure to credit risk.

Xilinx is subject to concentrations of
credit risk primarily in its trade accounts receivable and investments in debt
securities to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance
sheet. The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration of credit risk in its
trade receivables through its credit evaluation process, collection terms,
distributor sales to diverse end customers and through geographical dispersion
of sales. The Company obtained credit insurance for a portion of its accounts
receivable balance to further mitigate the concentration of its credit risk.
Xilinx generally does not require collateral for receivables from its end
customers or from distributors.


No end customer accounted for more than
10% of net revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006.

The Company mitigates concentrations of
credit risk in its investments in debt securities by currently investing more
than 90% of its portfolio in AA or higher grade securities as rated by Standard
& Poor’s or Moody’s Investors Service. The Company’s methods to arrive at
investment decisions are not solely based on the rating agency’s credit ratings.
Xilinx also performs additional credit due diligence and conducts regular
portfolio credit reviews. Additionally, Xilinx limits its investments in the
debt securities of a single issuer based upon the issuer’s credit rating and
attempts to further mitigate credit risk by diversifying risk across geographies
and type of issuer. At March 29, 2008, 55% and 45% of its investments in debt
securities were domestic and foreign issuers, respectively. See Note 5 for
detailed information about the Company’s investment portfolio.

As of March 29, 2008, approximately 4%
of the investment portfolio consisted of AAA-rated auction rate securities which
are secured primarily by pools of student loans originated under FFELP that are
guaranteed by the U. S. Department of Education. These securities experienced
failed auctions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 due to liquidity issues in
the global credit markets. In a failed auction, the interest rates are reset to
a maximum rate defined by the contractual terms for each security. The Company
has collected and expects to collect all interest payable on these securities
when due. As of March 29, 2008, the securities were reclassified from short-term
to long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet to reflect the
securities’ final maturity dates since there can be no assurance of a successful
auction in the future. The auction rate securities described above are a type of
asset-backed securities. All other asset-backed securities comprised less than
5% of the investment portfolio as of March 29, 2008 and were all AAA rated with
the exception of approximately $37.0 million of asset-backed securities that
were downgraded in April 2008 to AA or A rating. These asset-backed securities
are secured primarily by bank, finance and insurance company obligations,
collateralized loan and bank obligations, mortgage-backed securities with no
direct sub-prime exposure and credit card debt. Substantially all of the other
mortgage-backed securities in the portfolio are AAA rated, were issued by U.S.
government-sponsored enterprises and agencies and represented less than 9% of
the portfolio as of March 29, 2008.

Dependence on Independent Manufacturers and Subcontractors

The Company does not directly
manufacture the finished silicon wafers used to manufacture its products. Xilinx
receives a substantial majority of its finished wafers from one independent
wafer manufacturer located in Taiwan. The Company is also dependent on a limited
number of subcontractors, primarily located in the Asia Pacific region, to
provide semiconductor assembly, test and shipment services.

Note 3. Stock-Based Compensation
Plans

The Company’s equity incentive plans
are broad-based, long-term retention programs that are intended to attract and
retain talented employees as well as align stockholder and employee
interests.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective April 2, 2006, the Company
adopted SFAS 123(R), as discussed in Note 2.

Stock-based compensation recognized
beginning in fiscal 2007 as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) as well as
pro forma disclosures according to the original provisions of SFAS 123 for
periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) use the Black-Scholes option
pricing model for estimating fair value of options granted under the Company’s
stock option plans and rights to acquire stock granted under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.

In June 2006, stockholder derivative
complaints were filed against the Company concerning the Company’s historical
option-granting practices and the SEC initiated an informal inquiry on the
matter. An investigation of the Company’s historical stock option-granting
practices was conducted by outside counsel and no evidence of fraud, management
misconduct or manipulation in the timing or exercise price of stock option
grants was found. The investigation determined that in nearly all cases, stock
options were issued as of pre-set dates; however, there were some minor
differences between the recorded grant dates and measurement dates for certain
grants made between 1997 and 2006. As a result, a $2.2 million charge was taken
to the Company’s earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Subsequently the
SEC informal inquiry was terminated and no enforcement action was recommended
and the stockholder derivative complaints were dismissed.

In accordance with SFAS 123(R), the
Company adjusts stock-based compensation on a quarterly basis for changes to the
estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture
experience. The effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense
amortization after April 1, 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture
estimate is changed. The effect of forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2008 and
2007 was insignificant.

The amount that the Company would have
capitalized to inventory as of April 1, 2006, if it had applied the provisions
of SFAS 123(R) retrospectively, was $4.5 million. Under the provisions of SFAS
123(R), this $4.5 million was recorded as a credit to additional
paid-in-capital. The total stock-based compensation released from the inventory
capitalization during fiscal 2008 and 2007 was $675 thousand and $2.3 million,
respectively, which resulted in an ending inventory balance of $1.5 million and
$2.2 million related to stock-based compensation at March 29, 2008 and March 31,
2007, respectively. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, the tax benefit realized
for the tax deduction from option exercises and other awards, including amounts
credited to additional paid-in capital, totaled $25.3 million, $35.8 million and
$40.6 million, respectively.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R),
the Company adopted the disclosure-only alternative allowed under SFAS 123, as
amended by SFAS 148. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS
123(R) was not reflected in the Company’s results of operations for fiscal 2006
for stock option awards as all options were granted with an exercise price equal
to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. In
addition, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was deemed non-compensatory under the
provisions of APB 25. Forfeitures of awards were recognized as they occurred for
the period prior to the adoption.

Pro forma information required under
SFAS 123 for fiscal 2006 as if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based compensation, was as
follows:

The fair values of stock options and
stock purchase plan rights under the Company’s equity incentive plans and
Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated as of the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company’s expected stock price
volatility assumption for stock options is estimated using implied volatility of
the Company’s traded options. The expected life of options granted is based on
the historical exercise activity as well as the expected disposition of all
options outstanding. The expected life of options granted also considers the
contractual term which decreased to seven years beginning in the first quarter
of fiscal 2008 thereby decreasing the expected life by nearly one year.
Calculated under SFAS 123(R) (SFAS 123 for fiscal 2006), the per share
weighted-average fair values of stock options granted during fiscal 2008, 2007
and 2006 were $7.23, $9.02 and $7.99, respectively. The per share
weighted-average fair values of stock purchase rights granted under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $7.20, $6.51 and
$7.89, respectively. The fair value of stock options and stock purchase plan
rights granted in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 were estimated at the date of grant
using the following weighted average assumptions:

The Company began granting restricted
stock units (RSUs) in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The estimated fair value
of RSU awards was calculated based on the market price of Xilinx common stock on
the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid
on Xilinx common stock prior to vesting. Calculated under SFAS 123(R), the per
share weighted-average fair value of RSUs granted during fiscal 2008 was $24.46.
The weighted-average fair value of RSUs granted in fiscal 2008 was calculated
based on estimates at the date of grant as follows:

      share of Xilinx’s stock on March 28, 2008, for all in-the-money options
      outstanding.

Options outstanding that are expected
to vest are net of estimated future option forfeitures in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 123(R), which are estimated when compensation costs are
recognized. Options with a fair value of $80.8 million completed vesting during
fiscal 2008. As of March 29, 2008, total unrecognized stock-based compensation
costs related to stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan was $75.3
million and $6.3 million, respectively. The total unrecognized stock-based
compensation cost for stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years and 0.6 years,
respectively.

Employee
Stock Option Plans

Under the Company’s stock option plans
(Option Plans), options reserved for future issuance of common shares to
employees and directors of the Company total 58.9 million shares as of March 29,
2008, including 9.6 million shares available for future grants under the 2007
Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Plan). Options to purchase shares of the Company’s
common stock under the Option Plans are granted at 100% of the fair market value
of the stock on the date of grant. The contractual term for stock awards granted
under the 2007 Plan is seven years from the grant date. Prior to April 1, 2007,
stock options granted by the Company generally expired ten years from the grant
date. Stock awards granted to existing and newly hired employees generally vest
over a four-year period from the date of grant.

In July 2006, the stockholders approved
the adoption of the 2007 Plan and authorized 10.0 million shares to be reserved
for issuance thereunder. On August 9, 2007, the stockholders approved an
amendment to increase the authorized number of shares reserved for issuance
under the 2007 Plan by 5.0 million shares. The types of awards allowed under the
2007 Plan include incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, RSUs,
restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. To date, the Company has issued
a mix of non-qualified stock options and RSUs under the 2007 Plan. The mix of
stock options and RSU awards will change depending upon the grade level of the
employees. Employees at the lower grade levels will receive mostly RSUs and may
also receive stock options, whereas employees at the higher grade levels,
including the Company’s executive officers, will receive mostly stock options
and may also receive RSUs. The 2007 Plan, which became effective on January 1,
2007, replaced both the Company’s 1997 Stock Plan (which expired on May 8, 2007)
and the Supplemental Stock Option Plan and all available but unissued shares
under these prior plans were cancelled as of April

1, 2007. The 2007 Plan is now Xilinx’s only plan for providing
stock-based awards to eligible employees and non-employee directors. At its 2008
annual stockholder meeting, the Company will seek stockholder approval of an
increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2007 Plan by
4.0 million shares.

The total pre-tax intrinsic value of
options exercised during fiscal 2008 and 2007 was $65.8 million and $75.5
million, respectively. This intrinsic value represents the difference between
the exercise price and the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on
the date of exercise.

Since the Company adopted the policy of
retiring all repurchased shares of its common stock, new shares are issued upon
employees’ exercise of their stock options.

Employee
Qualified Stock Purchase Plan

Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
qualified employees can obtain a 24-month purchase right to purchase the
Company’s common stock at the end of six-month exercise periods. Participation
is limited to 15% of the employee’s annual earnings up to a maximum of $21
thousand in a calendar year. More than 80% of all eligible employees participate
in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of
the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of the 24-month offering
period or at the end of each six-month exercise period. Employees purchased 2.1
million shares for $36.6 million in fiscal 2008, 2.0 million shares for $34.2
million in fiscal 2007 and 1.4 million shares for $33.0 million in fiscal 2006.
On August 9, 2007, the stockholders approved an amendment to increase the
authorized number of shares reserved for issuance under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan by 2.0 million shares. As of March 29, 2008, 7.8 million shares
were available for future issuance out of 38.5 million shares authorized. At its
2008 annual stockholder meeting, the Company will seek stockholder approval of
an increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan by 2.0 million shares.

Note 4. Investment in United
Microelectronics Corporation

During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2008, the Company sold its remaining equity investment in UMC stock. Prior to
the sale, the Company accounted for its investment in UMC as available-for-sale
marketable securities in accordance with SFAS 115.

In August 2007, UMC announced a capital
reduction program to reduce its outstanding shares of 18.95 billion by 5.74
billion shares or 30.3%, down to 13.21 billion shares. As part of the capital
reduction program, the UMC stockholders would receive a cash distribution of
NT$3.03 per share for each share of the UMC stock cancelled. In October 2007,
the Company received a cash distribution of $10.7 million from UMC in connection
with this capital reduction program. For accounting purposes, the cash
distribution of $10.7 million was treated as a reduction of the adjusted cost in
UMC investment. After the capital reduction, the number of UMC shares held by
the Company was reduced from 115.5 million shares to 80.5 million shares, as of
December 29, 2007.

During fiscal 2007, the Company sold
325.9 million shares of its UMC investment for approximately $183.5 million in
cash, resulting in a gain of approximately $7.0 million. The gain is included in
interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. As of March
31, 2007, the Company held 115.5 million shares of UMC stock.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2008, the Company sold the remaining 80.5 million shares of its UMC investment
for approximately $47.1 million in cash, resulting in a loss of approximately
$4.7 million. The loss is included in interest and other, net in the
consolidated statements of income.

During fiscal 2007, the fair value of
the UMC investment decreased by $209.4 million, including the sale of shares
noted above. At March 31, 2007, the Company recorded a total of $1.7 million of
deferred tax liabilities and a $2.8 million balance (net of tax) in accumulated
other comprehensive income associated with the UMC investment.

The gross unrealized losses on these
investments were primarily due to a rising interest rate environment in fiscal
2007 and recent adverse conditions in the global credit markets in fiscal 2008.
The Company reviewed the investment portfolio and determined that the gross
unrealized losses on these investments at March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007 were
temporary in nature. The aggregate of individual unrealized losses that had been
outstanding for 12 months or more were not significant as of March 29, 2008 and
March 31, 2007. The Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments
until recovery of their carrying values. The Company also believes that it will
be able to collect both principal and interest amounts due to the Company at
maturity, given the high credit quality of these investments and any related
underlying collateral.

The amortized cost and estimated fair
value of marketable debt securities (bank certificates of deposit, commercial
paper, corporate bonds, auction rate securities, municipal bonds, U.S. and
foreign government and agency securities, floating rate notes, asset-backed
securities and mortgage-backed securities) at March 29, 2008, by contractual
maturity, are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations
without call or prepayment penalties.

Note 7. Impairment Loss on
Investments

The Company recognized impairment
losses on investments of $2.9 million, $2.0 million and $1.4 million during
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to non-marketable equity
securities in private companies. These impairment losses resulted primarily from
weak financial conditions of certain investees, certain investees diluting
Xilinx’s investment through the receipt of additional rounds of investment at a
lower valuation or from the liquidation of certain investees.

Note 8. Commitments

Xilinx leases some of its facilities
and office buildings under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at
various dates through October 2017. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006,
Xilinx entered into a land lease in conjunction with the Company’s new building
investment in Singapore. The lease cost was settled in an up-front payment in
June 2006. Some of the operating leases for facilities and office buildings
require payment of operating costs, including property taxes,


repairs, maintenance and insurance.
Most of the Company’s leases contain renewal options for varying terms.
Approximate future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases
are as follows:

Aggregate future rental income to be
received, which includes rents from both owned and leased property, totaled $7.4
million at March 29, 2008. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all
operating leases was $8.2 million for fiscal 2008, $8.7 million for fiscal 2007
and $6.5 million for fiscal 2006. Rental income, which includes rents received
from both owned and leased property, was not material for fiscal 2008, 2007 or
2006.

Other commitments at March 29, 2008
totaled $74.3 million and consisted of purchases of inventory and other
non-cancelable purchase obligations related to subcontractors that manufacture
silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The Company expects
to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six
months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications. As of March
29, 2008, the Company also had $21.5 million of non-cancelable license
obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and
hardware/software maintenance expiring at various dates through September 2011.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005,
the Company committed up to $20.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to
intellectual property until July 2023. License payments will be amortized over
the useful life of the intellectual property acquired.

Note 9. Net Income Per Common Share

The computation of basic net income per
common share for all periods presented is derived from the information on the
consolidated statements of income, and there are no reconciling items in the
numerator used to compute diluted net income per common share. The total shares
used in the denominator of the diluted net income per common share calculation
includes 3.6 million, 5.7 million and 6.0 million common equivalent shares
attributable to outstanding stock awards for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, that are not included in basic net income per common
share.

Outstanding out-of-the-money stock
options to purchase approximately 39.9 million, 40.7 million and 31.1 million
shares, for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, under the Company's stock
option plans were excluded from diluted net income per common share, applying
the treasury stock method, as their inclusion would have been antidilutive.
These options could be dilutive in the future if the Company’s average share
price increases and is greater than the combined exercise prices and the
unamortized fair values of these options.

Diluted net income per common share
does not include any incremental shares issuable upon the exchange of the
debentures (see Note 12). The debentures will have no impact on diluted net
income per common share until the price of the Company’s common stock exceeds
the conversion price of $31.18 per share, because the principal amount of the
debentures will be settled in cash upon conversion. Prior to conversion, the
Company will include, in the diluted net income per common share calculation,
the effect of the additional shares that may be issued when the Company’s common
stock price exceeds $31.18 per share, using the treasury stock method. The
conversion price of $31.18 per common share excludes any potential adjustments
to the conversion ratio provided under the terms of the debentures.

Note 11. Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive income is defined as the
change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events
and circumstances from nonowner sources. The difference between net income and
comprehensive income for the Company results from unrealized gains (losses) on
its available-for-sale securities, net of taxes, foreign currency translation
adjustments and hedging transactions.

The change in the accumulated
unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities, net of tax, at March
29, 2008, primarily reflects the decrease in value of the UMC investment since
March 31, 2007 and the sale of the remaining UMC investment in fiscal 2008 (see
Note 4). In addition, the unrealized loss on the Company’s short-term and
long-term investments decreased by $1.5 million during fiscal 2008 due to
liquidation of certain investments with loss positions and changes in interest
rates.

Note 12. Convertible Debentures and
Revolving Credit Facility

3.125%
Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures

In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00
billion principal amount of 3.125% convertible debentures due March 15, 2037, to
an initial purchaser in a private offering. The debentures are subordinated in
right of payment to the Company’s existing and future senior debt and to the
other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. The debentures are initially
convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of Xilinx common stock
at a conversion rate of 32.0760 shares of common stock per $1 thousand principal
amount of debentures, representing an initial effective conversion price of
approximately $31.18 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be
subject to adjustment for certain events as outlined in the indenture governing
the debentures but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. The Company
received net proceeds of $980.0 million after deduction of issuance costs of
$20.0 million. The debt issuance costs are recorded in long-term other assets
and are being amortized to interest expense over 30 years. Interest is payable
semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15, beginning on September 15,
2007. Interest expense related to the debentures for fiscal 2008 and 2007
totaled $32.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, and was included in
interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of income. The debentures
also have a contingent interest component that will require the Company to pay
interest based on certain thresholds beginning with the semi-annual interest
period commencing on March 15, 2014 (the maximum amount of contingent interest
that will accrue is 0.50% per year) and upon the occurrence of certain events,
as outlined in the indenture governing the debentures.

On or after March 15, 2014, the Company
may redeem all or part of the debentures for the principal amount plus any
accrued and unpaid interest if the closing price of the Company’s common stock
has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20
trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period prior to the date on
which the Company provides notice of redemption. Upon conversion, the Company
would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of Xilinx
common stock, up to the principal amount of the debentures. If the conversion
value


exceeds $1 thousand, the Company may
also deliver, at its option, cash or common stock or a combination of cash and
common stock for the conversion value in excess of $1 thousand (conversion
spread). There would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per
common share computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that
portion of the debt instrument will always be settled in cash. The conversion
spread will be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net
income per common share.

Holders of the debentures may convert
their debentures only upon the occurrence of certain events in the future, as
outlined in the indenture. In addition, holders of the debentures who convert
their debentures in connection with a fundamental change, as defined in the
indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in
the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, the
holders of the debentures may require Xilinx to purchase all or a portion of
their debentures at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. As of March 29, 2008, none
of the conditions allowing holders of the debentures to convert had been
met.

The Company concluded that the embedded
features related to the contingent interest payments and the Company making
specific types of distributions (e.g., extraordinary dividends) qualify as
derivatives and should be bundled as a compound embedded derivative under SFAS
133. The fair value of the derivative at the date of issuance of the debentures
was $2.5 million and is accounted for as a discount on the debentures. The
initial fair value of the debentures of $997.5 million will be accreted to par
value over the term of the debt resulting in $2.5 million being amortized to
interest expense over 30 years. Any change in fair value of this embedded
derivative will be included in interest and other, net on the Company’s
consolidated statements of income. The fair value of the derivative as of March
29, 2008 and March 31, 2007 was $2.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively. The
balance of the debentures on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at March
29, 2008 and March 31, 2007 was $999.9 million and $999.6 million, respectively,
including the fair value of the embedded derivative. The Company also concluded
that the debentures are not conventional convertible debt instruments and that
the embedded stock conversion option qualifies as a derivative under SFAS 133.
In addition, in accordance with

Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-19 of the FASB,
“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments indexed to and Potentially
Settled in a Company’s own Stock,” the Company has concluded that the embedded
conversion option would be classified in stockholders’ equity if it were a
freestanding instrument. Accordingly, the embedded conversion option is not
required to be accounted for separately as a derivative.

Under the terms of the debentures, the
Company was required to file a shelf registration statement covering resales of
the debentures and any common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures
with the SEC and cause the shelf registration statement to be declared effective
within 180 days of the closing of the offering of the debentures. In addition,
the Company must maintain the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement
for a period of two years after the closing of the offering of the debentures.
If the Company fails to meet these terms, it will be required to pay additional
interest on the debentures at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% for the first 90
days after the occurrence of the event and 0.50% after the first 90 days. The
Company filed the shelf registration statement with the SEC in June
2007.

Revolving Credit Facility

In April 2007, Xilinx entered into a
five-year $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of banks. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a
benchmark rate plus an applicable margin based upon the Company’s credit rating.
In connection with the credit facility, the Company is required to maintain
certain financial and non-financial covenants. As of March 29, 2008, the Company
has made no borrowings under this credit facility.

Note 13. Stockholders’
Equity

Preferred Stock

The Company’s Certificate of
Incorporation authorized 2.0 million shares of undesignated preferred stock. The
preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. The Board of Directors is
authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of preferred
stock. As of March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007, no preferred shares were issued
or outstanding.

Common Stock Repurchase Programs

The Board of Directors has approved
stock repurchase programs enabling the Company to repurchase its common stock in
the open market or through negotiated transactions with independent financial
institutions. On February 26, 2007, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to
$1.50 billion of common stock. On February 25, 2008, the Board authorized the
repurchase of up to an additional $800.0 million of common stock. These share
repurchase programs have no stated expiration date. Through March 29, 2008, the
Company had repurchased $1.31 billion of the $1.50 billion of common


stock approved for repurchase under the
February 2007 authorization. The Company’s current policy is to retire all
repurchased shares, and consequently, no treasury shares were held at March 29,
2008 or March 31, 2007.

During the second, third and fourth
quarters of fiscal 2008 and all four quarters of fiscal 2007, the Company
entered into stock repurchase agreements with independent financial
institutions. Under these agreements, Xilinx provided these financial
institutions with up-front payments totaling $550.0 million for fiscal 2008 and
$1.05 billion for fiscal 2007. These financial institutions agreed to deliver to
Xilinx a certain number of shares based upon the volume weighted-average price,
during an averaging period, less a specified discount. Under the terms of the
accelerated share repurchase program (ASR) entered into during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company paid $700.0 million upfront in exchange for
a minimum number of shares (25.7 million) of its common stock, which were
delivered to the Company in fiscal 2007. The $700.0 million was recorded in
stockholders’ equity in fiscal 2007. Upon completion of the ASR on June 19,
2007, the Company did not receive any additional shares since the volume
weighted-average price, during an averaging period, less a specified discount,
exceeded the upside threshold price specified in the ASR of $27.21. In addition,
under the guidelines of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, Xilinx entered into
other agreements with the same independent financial institutions within the
first, second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 to repurchase additional shares
on its behalf after the conclusion of the purchase period of the aforementioned
agreements. As of March 29, 2008, no amounts remained outstanding under any
stock repurchase agreements and all related shares had been delivered to the
Company.

During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
Company repurchased a total of 23.5 million, 55.2 million and 15.0 million
shares of common stock for $550.0 million, $1.43 billion and $400.0 million,
respectively.

Dividend

On February 25, 2008, the Board of
Directors approved an increase to the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend
from $0.12 per common share to $0.14 per common share, which is payable on May
28, 2008 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 7,
2008.

2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

At March 29, 2008, the Company had
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $20.8
million. If unused, these carryforwards will expire in 2014 through 2026. The
Company had federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$99.6 million, federal affordable housing tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $17.9


million and no other state credit
carryforwards. If unused, $39.6 million of the tax credit carryforwards will
expire in 2025 through 2028.

Unremitted foreign earnings that are
considered to be permanently invested outside the United States and on which no
U.S. taxes have been provided, are approximately $659.0 million as of March 29,
2008. The residual U.S. tax liability, if such amounts were remitted, would be
approximately $199.9 million.

The Company has manufacturing
operations in Ireland and Singapore. In Ireland, the Company operates under a
special tax regime granted for manufacturing status. Under this regime, the
majority of the income earned in Ireland is subject to tax at 10%. The regime
granting manufacturing status is effective through fiscal 2010. The tax benefit
from this special status for fiscal 2008 is approximately $1.5 million on income
considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The Company has been granted
“Pioneer Status” in Singapore that is effective through fiscal 2021. The Pioneer
Status reduces the Company’s tax on the majority of Singapore income from 20% to
zero. The benefit of Pioneer Status in Singapore for fiscal 2008 is
approximately $17.3 million ($0.06 per common share) on income considered
permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The tax effect of these low tax
jurisdictions on the Company’s overall tax rate is reflected in the table
above.

Long-term deferred tax assets of $66.1
million and $57.8 million at March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007, respectively,
are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet (see Note
6).

The Company adopted FIN 48 on April 1,
2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income
tax law. This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial
statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.

The cumulative effect of adopting FIN
48 was a decrease in tax reserves and increases in the April 1, 2007 balances of
additional paid-in capital and retained earnings of $1.0 million and of $5.5
million, respectively. The Company’s total gross unrecognized tax benefits upon
adoption were $103.1 million. In addition, consistent with the provisions of FIN
48, the Company reclassified $30.0 million of income tax liabilities from
current to non-current liabilities because payment of cash was not anticipated
within one year of the balance sheet date. These non-current income tax
liabilities are recorded in long-term income taxes payable in the consolidated
balance sheet.

A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits for
fiscal 2008 is as follows (in thousands):

If the remaining balance of $105.1
million of unrecognized tax benefits at March 29, 2008 were realized in a future
period, it would result in a tax benefit of $44.7 million and a reduction of the
effective tax rate.

The Company’s policy to include
interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within the provision
for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income did not change as a
result of implementing the provisions of FIN 48. The balance of accrued interest
and penalties recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at April 1, 2007 was
$1.5 million. This amount was also reclassified from current to non-current
liabilities upon adoption of FIN 48. Interest and penalties included in the
Company’s provision for income taxes totaled $1.4 million for fiscal
2008.

With limited exception, the Company is
no longer subject to U.S. federal and state audits by taxing authorities for
years through fiscal 2004. The Company is no longer subject to tax audits in
Ireland for years through fiscal 2002. The Company is currently under
examination by the IRS and California Franchise Tax Board for fiscal 2005. The
Company believes that due to various factors, including the current development
of ongoing audits, it is impractical to determine the amount of uncertain tax
benefits that will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12
months.

The IRS examined the Company’s tax
returns for fiscal 1996 through 2001. All issues were settled with the exception
of issues related to the cost sharing of stock options. On August 30, 2005, the
Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must
be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court
agreed with the Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in
the cost sharing agreement, and thus, the Company had no tax, interest or
penalties due for this issue. The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31,
2006. On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeal for the Ninth Circuit. The Company is opposing this appeal, as it
believes that the Tax Court decided the case correctly. The Company and the IRS
presented oral arguments to a three-judge panel of the Appeals Court on March
12, 2008. Management has assessed the risk of loss, and determined that no
accrual is required. If the Company were to lose on appeal, the amount due to
the IRS would be approximately $39.3 million. Of that amount, $6.2 million would
be an expense to the consolidated statement of income and the remaining $33.1
million would be an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. The Company would
also be required to reverse $7.6 million of interest income accrued to date on
prepayments to the IRS.


Note 15. Segment

Note 16. Litigation Settlements and
Contingencies

Internal Revenue Service

On August 25, 2006, the IRS filed a
Notice of Appeal that it appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Ninth
Circuit, the August 30, 2005 decision of the Tax Court. In its 2005 decision,
the Tax Court decided in favor of the Company and rejected the IRS’s position
that the value of compensatory stock options must be included in the Company’s
cost sharing agreement with its Irish affiliate. The Company is opposing this
appeal as it believes that the Tax Court decided the case correctly. The Company
and the IRS presented oral arguments to a three-judge panel of the Appeals Court
on March 12, 2008. Management has assessed the risk of loss, and determined that
no accrual is required (see Note 14).

The IRS and California Franchise Tax
Board are auditing the Company’s fiscal 2005 income tax returns. The Company
believes that adequate accruals have been provided for fiscal 2005 and all other
open tax years.

Patent Litigation

On December 28, 2007, a patent
infringement lawsuit was filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG (PACT) against the
Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall
Division (PACT XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No.
2:07-CV-563). PACT seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages and interest and
attorneys’ fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential
exposure to the Company is estimable at this time.


On August 21, 2007, a patent
infringement lawsuit was filed by Lonestar Inventions, L.P. (Lonestar) against
Xilinx in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler
Division (Lonestar Inventions, L.P. v. Xilinx, Inc. Case No. 6:07-CV-393).
Lonestar seeks injunctive relief, unspecified damages and interest and
attorneys’ fees. Neither the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential
exposure to the Company is estimable at this time.

On November 27, 2006, the Company
settled a patent infringement lawsuit under which the Company agreed to pay $6.5
million. The plaintiff agreed to dismiss the patent infringement lawsuit with
prejudice, granted a patent license to the Company and executed an agreement not
to sue the Company under any patent owned or controlled by the plaintiff for ten
years. As a result of the settlement agreement, the Company recorded a current
period charge of $2.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. The
remaining balance of $4.0 million represented the value of the prepaid patent
license granted as part of the settlement. This balance is being amortized over
the patent’s remaining useful life.

Sales
Representative Agreements Litigation

In the second quarter of fiscal 2006,
the Company accrued an additional $3.2 million that represented the settlement
payment for litigation related to an agreement with a sales
representative.

Other
Matters

Except as stated above, there are no
pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the Company is a party
or of which any of its property is the subject.

Note 17. Business
Combination

AccelChip, Inc.

In January 2006, Xilinx completed the
acquisition of AccelChip, a privately-held company that provides MATLAB®
synthesis software tools for designing digital signal processing systems. The
AccelChip acquisition aligns with Xilinx’s strategy for its existing DSP
products and product development roadmaps, since both AccelChip and Xilinx have
significant customer overlap and synergy across the digital communications,
multimedia, video and imaging, and defense systems market segments. The
acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The total
purchase price for AccelChip was $19.6 million in cash, including $436 thousand
of acquisition related costs. In connection with the transaction, Xilinx
recorded a charge to operations for acquired in-process R&D of $4.5 million.
In addition, Xilinx recorded approximately $8.9 million of goodwill and $9.7
million of other intangible assets, which resulted in amortization expense of
approximately $500 thousand in fiscal 2006. The financial results for AccelChip
are included in the Company’s consolidated results from the date of acquisition.
Pro forma information is not presented due to the immateriality of the operating
results of AccelChip prior to the acquisition. Xilinx had an equity investment
in AccelChip of $2.6 million prior to the acquisition. The investment, which was
included in the total purchase price of $19.6 million, was previously accounted
for under the cost method of accounting.

Following is the purchase price
allocation based on the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. Management considered a number of factors, including an
independent appraisal and expected uses of assets and dispositions of
liabilities, in determining the final purchase price allocation.

Amortization expense for all intangible
assets for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6.8 million, $8.0 million and $7.0
million, respectively. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.
Based on the carrying value of acquisition-related intangibles recorded at March
29, 2008, and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the
annual amortization expense for acquisition-related intangibles is expected to
be as follows: 2009 - $5.3 million; 2010 - $1.5 million; 2011 - $1.0
million.

Note 19. Employee Benefit
Plans

Xilinx offers various retirement
benefit plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total contributions to these
plans were $8.1 million, $5.9 million and $5.4 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. For employees in the U.S., the Company provides
discretionary 401(k) contributions when performance targets are met. As
permitted under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, Xilinx’s 401(k)
Plan (the 401(k) Plan) allows tax deferred salary deductions for eligible
employees. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the
401(k) Plan. Participants in the 401(k) Plan may make salary deferrals of up to
25% of the eligible annual salary, limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed
by the Internal Revenue Code. Effective January 1, 2003, participants who have
reached the age of 50 before the close of the plan year may be eligible to make
catch-up salary deferral contributions, up to 25% of eligible annual salary,
limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue
Code.

The Company allows its U.S.-based
officers, director-level employees, and its board members to defer a portion of
their compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan). The
Compensation Committee administers the Plan. At March 29, 2008, there were
approximately 118 participants in the Plan who self-direct their contributions
into investment options offered by the Plan. The Plan does not allow Plan
participants to invest directly in Xilinx’s stock. In the event Xilinx becomes
insolvent, Plan assets are subject to the claims of the Company’s general
creditors. There are no Plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or
minimum return on investments. At March 29, 2008, Plan assets were $27.0 million
and obligations were $31.8 million. At March 31, 2007, Plan assets were $25.2
million and obligations were $29.1 million.

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders

Xilinx, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Xilinx, Inc. as of March 29, 2008 and March 31,
2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 29, 2008.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Part IV, Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Xilinx, Inc. at March 29, 2008 and March 31,
2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended March 29, 2008, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 14 to the
consolidated financial statements, on April 1, 2007, the Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” Also, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, on April 2, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment."

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the effectiveness of Xilinx, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of March 29, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 27, 2008 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG
LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders

Xilinx, Inc.

We have audited Xilinx, Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2008, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Xilinx,
Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Xilinx, Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 29, 2008, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of Xilinx, Inc. as of March 29, 2008
and March 31, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended March 29, 2008 of Xilinx, Inc. and our report dated May 27, 2008 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS
WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out, under
the supervision of and with the participation of Xilinx, Inc.’s management,
including our CEO and CFO of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a–15(e) and 15d–15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based upon the controls evaluation, our
CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this
Form 10-K, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended March 29, 2008 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This system of internal control
is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and
transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management’s
authorization. The design, monitoring and revision of the system of internal
control over financial reporting involves, among other things, management’s
judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific
control measures. The effectiveness of the system of internal control over
financial reporting is supported by the selection, retention and training of
qualified personnel and an organizational structure that provides an appropriate
division of responsibility and formalized procedures. The system of internal
control is periodically reviewed and modified in response to changing
conditions.

Because of its inherent limitations, no
matter how well designed, a system of internal control over financial reporting
can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements or all fraud. Further, because of changes in conditions, the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.
Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct
deficiencies as they are identified.

Management has used the criteria
established in the Report ‘

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework’

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to evaluate the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this
evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of March 29, 2008.

The effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of March 29, 2008 has been audited
by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8. of this Form
10-K.
