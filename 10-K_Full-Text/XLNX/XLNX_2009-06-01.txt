ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx or the Company)
designs, develops and markets complete programmable logic solutions. These
solutions have several components:

Advanced integrated circuits (ICs) in the form of
  programmable logic devices (PLDs);

Software design tools to program the PLDs;

Predefined system functions delivered as
  intellectual property (IP) cores;

Design services;

Customer training; and

Field engineering and technical
  support.

Our PLDs include field programmable
gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) that our
customers program to perform desired logic functions. Our solutions are designed
to provide high integration and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment
manufacturers in end markets such as wired and wireless communications,
industrial, scientific and medical, aerospace and defense, audio, video and
broadcast, consumer, automotive and data processing. We sell our products
globally through independent domestic and foreign distributors and through
direct sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by a network of
independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management
organization.

Xilinx was founded and incorporated in
California in February 1984. In April 1990, the Company reincorporated in
Delaware. Our corporate facilities and executive offices are located at 2100
Logic Drive, San Jose, California 95124, and our website address is
www.xilinx.com.

Industry Overview

There are three principal types of ICs
used in most digital electronic systems: processors, which generally are
utilized for control and computing tasks; memory devices, which are used for
storing program instructions and data; and logic devices, which generally are
used to manage the interchange and manipulation of digital signals within a
system. Xilinx develops PLDs, a type of logic device. Alternatives to PLDs
include custom gate arrays, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and
application specific standard products (ASSPs). These devices all compete with
each other since they may be utilized in many of the same types of applications
within electronic systems. However, variations in unit pricing, development
cost, product performance, reliability, power consumption, density,
functionality, ease of use and time-to-market determine the degree to which the
devices compete for specific applications.

The primary advantage PLDs have over
custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs is that PLDs enable faster time-to-market
because of their shorter design cycles. Users can program the PLD to implement
their design, using software to create and revise their designs relatively
quickly with lower development costs. PLDs typically have a larger die size
resulting in higher costs per unit compared to custom gate arrays, ASICs and
ASSPs, which are customized to perform a limited fixed function. Custom gate
arrays, ASICs and ASSPs, however, generally offer less flexibility, require
longer design cycles and higher up-front costs than PLDs.

PLDs are standard components. This
means that the same device type can be sold to many different users for many
different applications. As a result, the development cost of PLDs can be spread
over a large number of users. Custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs, on the other
hand, are custom chips for an individual user for use in a specific application.
ASSPs implement specific functions for a limited set of users. This involves a
high up-front cost to users. Technology advances are enabling PLD companies to
reduce costs considerably, making PLDs an increasingly attractive alternative to
custom gate arrays, ASICs and ASSPs.


An overview of typical PLD end market
applications for our products is shown in the following table:

Products

Integral to the success of our business
is the timely introduction of new products that meet customer requirements and
compete effectively with respect to price, functionality, power and performance.
Software design tools, IP cores, reference platforms, technical support and
design services are also critical components that enable our customers to
implement their design specifications into our PLDs. Altogether, our PLDs and
related tools, IP, service and support form a comprehensive programmable logic
solution. A brief overview of our PLD offerings follows and is not all-inclusive
but does comprise the majority of our revenues. Some of our more mature product
families have been excluded from the table although they continue to generate
revenues. We operate and track our results in one operating segment for
financial reporting purposes.

Virtex FPGAs

The Virtex-6 FPGA family consists of 13
devices and is the sixth generation in the Virtex series of FPGAs. Virtex-6
FPGAs are fabricated on a high-performance, 40-nm process technology. The
Virtex-6 family is comprised of three domain-optimized platforms to deliver
different feature mixes to address a variety of markets as follows:

LXT platform: for applications that require
  high-performance logic, digital signal processing (DSP), and serial
  connectivity;

SXT platform: for applications that require ultra
  high-performance DSP and serial connectivity;

HXT platform: for communications applications that
  require the highest-speed serial connectivity.

The Virtex-5 FPGA family consists of 26
devices and five platforms: Virtex-5 LX FPGAs for logic-intensive designs,
Virtex-5 LXT FPGAs for high-performance logic with serial connectivity, Virtex-5
SXT FPGAs for high-performance DSP with serial connectivity, Virtex-5 FXT FPGAs
for embedded processing with serial connectivity and Virtex-5 TXT FPGAs for
high-bandwidth serial connectivity.

Prior generation Virtex families
include Virtex-4, Virtex-II Pro, Virtex-II, Virtex-E and the original Virtex
family.


Spartan FPGAs

The sixth generation in the Spartan
FPGA series, the Spartan-6 FPGA family, is fabricated on a low-power 45-nm
process technology. The Spartan-6 family is the PLD industry’s first 45-nm
high-volume FPGA family. The family consists of 11 devices and is delivered on
two FPGA platforms to address diverse market and application requirements as
follows:

LX platform: for applications that require
  cost-effective logic, memory and DSP;

LXT platform: for applications that require LX
  features plus high-speed serial transceivers.

Spartan-3 FPGAs were the PLD industry’s first 90-nm FPGAs
and are comprised of three platforms including the original Spartan-3 family,
the Spartan-3E family and the Spartan-3A family.

Prior generation Spartan families
include Spartan-IIE, Spartan-II, Spartan XL and the original Spartan
family.

EasyPath FPGAs

EasyPath™ FPGAs use the same production
masks and fabrication process as standard FPGAs and are tested to a specific
customer application to improve yield and lower costs. As a result, EasyPath
FPGAs provide customers with significant cost reduction when compared to the
standard FPGA devices without the conversion risk, conversion engineering effort
or the additional time required to move to an ASIC. EasyPath FPGAs are available
for the higher density devices of the Virtex-II Pro, Virtex-4 and Virtex-5
families. EasyPath FPGAs will also be available for the higher densities of the
Virtex-6 family. Customers purchasing EasyPath FPGAs must meet certain minimum
order requirements and pay a custom test generation charge.

CPLDs

CPLDs operate on the low end of the
programmable logic density spectrum. CPLDs are single chip, nonvolatile
solutions characterized by instant-on and universal interconnect.

The CoolRunner-II family is the latest
generation Xilinx CPLD family with six devices in production. CoolRunner-II
CPLDs combine the advantages of ultra low power consumption with the benefits of
high performance and low cost. While CoolRunner-II is suitable for a wide
variety of end markets and applications, the ultra low power consumption and
small package profiles of these devices have led to their acceptance in the
growing portable consumer electronics marketplace.

Prior generation CPLD families include
the CoolRunner, XC9500 and XC9500XL, which offer low cost, high performance and
in-system programmability for 5.0-volt and 3.3-volt systems,
respectively.

Support Products

Targeted Design Platforms

We offer Targeted Design Platforms
comprised of reference designs, target boards, application software, design
tools, IP and silicon to reduce our customers’ development effort. Targeted
Design Platforms are organized into three levels: the Base Platform; the
Domain-Specific Platform; and the Market-Specific Platform to offer customers
flexibility, accessibility, applicability and time-to-market.

The Base Platform is the delivery
vehicle for all new silicon offerings used to develop and run customer-specific
software applications and hardware designs. Released at launch, the Base
Platform is comprised of: FPGA silicon; ISE® (Integrated Software Environment)
Design Suite design environment; third-party synthesis, simulation, and signal
integrity tools; reference designs; development boards and IP.

The Domain-Specific Platform targets
one of the three primary Xilinx FPGA user profiles: the embedded processing
developer; the DSP developer; or the logic/connectivity developer. It
accomplishes this by augmenting the Base Platform with a targeted set of
integrated technologies, including: higher-level design methodologies and tools;
domain-specific IP including embedded, DSP and connectivity; domain-specific
development hardware and reference designs; and operating systems and software.

The Market-Specific Platform enables
software or hardware developers to quickly build and run their specific
application or solution. Built for specific markets such as automotive,
consumer, aerospace and defense, communications, audio, video and broadcast,
industrial, or scientific and medical, the Market-Specific Platform integrates
both the Base and Domain-Specific Platforms with higher targeted applications
elements such as IP, reference designs and boards optimized for a particular
market.


Design Environments

To accommodate the various design
methodologies and design flows employed by the wide range of our customers’ user
profiles such as system designers, algorithm designers, software coders and
logic designers, we provide the appropriate design environment tailored to each
user profile for design creation, design implementation and design verification.

The Xilinx ISE® Design Suite features a
complete tool chain for the three domain-specific categories: embedded, DSP and
logic/connectivity. To further enhance productivity and help customers better
manage the complexity of their designs, the ISE Design Suite enables designers
to target area, performance, or power by simply selecting a design goal in the
setup. The Xilinx ISE Design Suite also integrates with a wide range of
third-party electronic design automation (EDA) software offerings and
point-tools.

Intellectual Property

Xilinx and various third parties offer
hundreds of free and for-license IP components to meet timing parameters,
including a host of widely used IP such as GigE, Ethernet, memory controllers,
and PCIe®, as well as an abundance of domain-specific IP, such as embedded, DSP
and connectivity, and market-specific IP.

Development Boards, Reference Designs, Kits and Configuration Products

In addition to the broad selection of
legacy development boards presently offered, we have introduced a new unified
board strategy that enables the creation of a standardized and coordinated set
of base boards available both from Xilinx and our ecosystem partners, all
utilizing the industry-standard extensions. Adopting this standard for all of
our base boards enables the creation of a unified, scalable and extensible
delivery mechanism for all Xilinx Targeted Design Platforms.

As a part of the Targeted Design
Platform support strategy, Xilinx has also defined a new class of reference
designs called the Targeted Reference Designs that offer a consistent, robust
framework that is scalable for customer modification and supported throughout
the product lifecycle.

We also offer comprehensive development
kits including hardware, design tools, IP and reference designs that are
designed to streamline and accelerate the development of domain-specific and
market-specific applications.

Finally, Xilinx offers a range of
configuration products including one-time programmable and in-system
programmable storage devices to configure Xilinx FPGAs. These PROM (programmable
read-only memory) products support all of our FPGA devices.

Third-Party Ecosystem

Xilinx and certain third parties have
developed and continue to offer a robust ecosystem of IP, boards, tools,
services, and support through the Xilinx alliance program. Xilinx is also moving
forward with these third parties to make Targeted Design Platforms extensible
through third-party tools, IP, software, boards, and design services, and
leveraged in customer designs.

Global Services

Xilinx engineering services and our
third-party alliance member services enhance the substantial benefits of the
Targeted Design Platforms by allowing the customer to focus even more on their
core competencies, realize additional time-to-market efficiencies and reduce
their fixed engineering costs. These services provide customers with engineering
resources to augment their design team and to provide expert design-specific
advice. Xilinx tailors its engineering services to the needs of its customer,
ranging from hands-on training to full design creation and implementation.

See information under the caption
“Results of Operations – Net Revenues” in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information about
our revenues from our product families.

Research and
Development

Our research and development (R&D)
activities are primarily directed towards the design of new ICs, the development
of new software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software, the
design of logic IP cores, the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing
processes for ongoing cost reductions, performance and signal integrity
improvements and the lowering of PLD power consumption. As a result of our
R&D efforts, we have introduced a number of new products during the past
several years including the Virtex-6, Virtex-5 and Spartan-6 families.
Additionally, we have made enhancements to our IP core offerings and introduced
new versions of our ISE Design Suite. We extended our collaboration with our
foundry suppliers in the development of 65-nm, 45-nm and 40-nm complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing technology and we were the first
company in the PLD industry to ship 65-nm and 45-nm high-volume FPGA devices.


Our R&D challenge is to continue to
develop new products that create cost-effective solutions for customers. In
fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, our R&D expenses were $355.4 million, $358.1
million and $388.1 million, respectively. We believe

technical leadership and innovation
are essential to our future success and we are committed to maintaining a
significant level of R&D investment.

Sales and Distribution

We sell our products to OEMs and to
electronic components distributors who resell these products to OEMs or contract
manufacturers.

We use dedicated global sales and
marketing organizations as well as independent sales representatives to generate
sales. In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited
number of key accounts with independent sales representatives often addressing
those customers in defined territories. Distributors create demand within the
balance of our customer base. Distributors also provide vendor-managed
inventory, value-added services and logistics for a wide range of our OEM
customers.

Whether Xilinx, the independent sales
representative, or the distributor identifies the sales opportunity, a local
distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders. In
such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they
bear all legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial
goods, such as credit loss, inventory shrinkage and theft, as well as foreign
currency fluctuations, but excluding indemnity and warranty
liability.

In accordance with our distribution
agreements and industry practice, we have granted the distributors the
contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic
basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a
subsequent change in list prices. Revenue recognition on shipments to
distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the
distributors’ end customers.

Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes the
substantial majority of our products worldwide. No end customer accounted for
more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. As of March 28,
2009 and March 29, 2008, Avnet accounted for 81% and 83% of the Company’s total
accounts receivable, respectively. Resale of product through Avnet accounted for
55%, 61% and 67% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively. We also use other regional distributors throughout the
world. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific
geographies, as we deem appropriate given the level of business, their
performance and financial condition. We believe distributors provide a
cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing
efficient logistics services. Since PLDs are standard products, they do not
present many of the inventory risks to distributors posed by custom gate arrays,
and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support. See “Note
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk” to our
consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” for information about concentrations of credit risk and
“Note 17. Segment Information” for information about our revenues from external
customers and domestic and international operations.

Backlog

As of March 28, 2009, our backlog from
OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our distributors
scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $162.0 million, compared
to $202.0 million as of March 29, 2008. Orders from end customers to our
distributors are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation
without significant penalty. As a result, backlogs from both OEM customers and
end customers reported by our distributors as of any particular period may not
be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period.

Wafer Fabrication

As a fabless semiconductor company, we
do not manufacture wafers used for our IC products or PROMs. Rather, we purchase
wafers from multiple foundries including United Microelectronics Corporation
(UMC), Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba), Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko), Samsung
Electronics

Co., Ltd.

and He Jian Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. Currently, UMC manufactures
the substantial majority of our wafers. Precise terms with respect to the volume
and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the
semiconductor foundries are determined by our periodic negotiations with the
wafer foundries.

Our strategy is to focus our resources
on market development and creating new ICs and software design tools rather than
on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry
relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well
as other suppliers of leading-edge process technologies.

In September 1995, we entered into a
joint venture with UMC and other parties to construct a wafer fabrication
facility in Taiwan, known as United Silicon Inc. (USIC). In January 2000, as a
result of the merger of USIC into UMC, our equity position in USIC was converted
into shares of UMC, which are publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In
fiscal 2007, we sold a portion of our UMC shares and we sold the remaining
shares of our UMC investment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.


In fiscal 1997, we signed a wafer
purchasing agreement with Seiko. Seiko manufactures wafers for some of our most
mature product lines.

In October 2004, the Company entered
into an advanced purchase agreement with Toshiba under which the Company paid
Toshiba a total of $100.0 million in two equal installments for advance payment
of silicon wafers produced under the agreement. The original agreement was
extended to December 2008. The balance of the advance payment remaining was zero
as of March 28, 2009.

Sort, Assembly and Test

Wafers purchased are sorted by the
foundry, independent sort subcontractors, or by Xilinx. Sorted die are assembled
by subcontractors. During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into
individual die, which are then assembled into various package types. Following
assembly, the packaged units are tested by Xilinx personnel at our San Jose,
California, Dublin, Ireland or Singapore facilities or by independent test
subcontractors. We purchase most of our assembly and some of our testing
services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. in Taiwan, Amkor Technology,
Inc. in Korea and the Philippines and STATS ChipPAC Ltd. in
Singapore.

Quality Certification

Xilinx has achieved quality management
systems certification for ISO 9001:2000 for our facilities in San Jose,
California, Dublin, Ireland, Longmont, Colorado, Singapore and Albuquerque, New
Mexico. In addition, Xilinx achieved ISO 14001, TL 9000 and TS 16949
environmental and quality certifications in the San Jose, Dublin and Singapore
locations, TL 9000 certifications in the Longmont and Albuquerque locations and
TS 16949 certifications in the Albuquerque and Hyderabad, India locations.

Patents and Licenses

While our various proprietary
intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe our
business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or
license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. As of March 28, 2009,
we held more than 2,000 issued United States (U.S.) patents, which vary in
duration, and over 750 pending U.S. patent applications relating to our
proprietary technology. We maintain an active program of filing for additional
patents in the areas of, but not limited to, circuits, software, IC
architecture, system design, testing methodologies and other technologies
relating to PLDs. We have licensed some parties to certain portions of our
patent portfolio and obtained licenses to certain third-party patents as
well.

We have acquired various licenses from
third parties to certain technologies that are implemented in IP cores or
embedded in our PLDs, such as processors. Those licenses support our continuing
ability to make and sell these PLDs to our customers. We also sublicense certain
third-party proprietary software and open-source software, such as compilers,
for our design tools. Continued use of those software components is important to
the operation of the design tools upon which customers depend.

We maintain the Xilinx trade name as
well as numerous trademarks and registered trademarks including Xilinx, Virtex,
Spartan, ISE, and associated logos. Maintaining these rights, and the goodwill
associated with these trademarks and logos, is important to our business. We
also have license rights to use certain trademarks owned by consortiums and
other trademark owners that are related to our products and business.

We intend to protect our intellectual
property vigorously. We believe that failure to enforce our intellectual
property rights (including, for example, patents, copyrights and trademarks) or
failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations. In the future, we may incur
potentially significant litigation expenses to defend against claims of
infringement or to enforce our intellectual property rights against third
parties. However, any such litigation may or may not be successful.

Employees

As of March 28, 2009, we had 3,145
employees compared to 3,415 as of the end of the prior fiscal year. None of our
employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work
stoppages and believe we maintain good employee relations.

Competition

Our PLDs compete in the logic IC
industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid
technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and
continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD
competitors, Altera Corporation (Altera), Lattice Semiconductor Corporation
(Lattice) and Actel Corporation (Actel), from the ASIC market, which has been
ongoing since the inception of FPGAs, from the ASSP market, and from new
companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market segment.
Other competitors include manufacturers of:


high-density programmable logic products
  characterized by FPGA-type architectures;

high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable
  replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;

ASICs and
  ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic;

high-speed,
  low-density CPLDs;

high-performance DSP devices;

products with
  embedded processors;

products with
  embedded multi-gigabit transceivers; and

other new or
  emerging programmable logic products.

We believe that important competitive
factors in the logic IC industry include:

also recognize that different applications require different programmable
technologies, and we are developing architectures, processes and products to
meet these varying customer needs. To the extent that our efforts to compete are
not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected.

ITEM 1A. RISK
FACTORS

The following risk factors and other
information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully
considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks
to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the
Company or that the Company’s management currently deems immaterial also may
impair its business operations. If any of the risks described below were to
occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could
be materially adversely affected.

General economic conditions and the
related deterioration in the global business environment could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Global consumer confidence has eroded
amidst concerns over declining asset values, inflation, volatility in energy
costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, rising
unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions,
financial markets, businesses and sovereign nations, among other concerns. These
concerns have slowed global economic growth and have resulted in recessions in
numerous countries, including many of those in North America, Europe and Asia.
Recent economic conditions had a negative impact on our results of operations
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 due to reduced customer
demand and it is unclear when economic conditions will improve. As these
economic conditions continue to persist, or if they worsen, a number of negative
effects on our business could result, including customers or potential customers
reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of key suppliers, which could result
in production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the
insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our
ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables and
ultimately decrease our net revenues and profitability.

The semiconductor industry is
characterized by cyclical market patterns and a significant industry downturn
could adversely affect our operating results

.

The semiconductor industry is highly
cyclical and our financial performance has been affected by downturns in the
industry, including the current downturn. Down cycles are generally
characterized by price erosion and weaker demand for our products. Weaker demand
for our products resulting from economic conditions in the end markets we serve
and reduced capital spending by our customers can result, and in the past has
resulted in excess and obsolete inventories and corresponding inventory
write-downs. We attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as
possible; however, the dynamics of the market make prediction of and timely
reaction to such events difficult. Due to these and other factors, our past
results are much less reliable predictors of the future than for companies in
older, more stable industries.

The nature of our business makes our
revenues difficult to predict which could have an adverse impact on our
business.

In addition to the challenging market
conditions we may face, we have limited visibility into the demand for our
products, particularly new products, because demand for our products depends
upon our products being designed into our end customers’ products and those
products achieving market acceptance. Due to the complexity of our customers’
designs, the design to volume production process for our customers requires a
substantial amount of time, frequently longer than a year. In addition, we are
increasingly dependent upon “turns,” orders received and turned for shipment in
the same quarter, and we have historically derived a significant portion of our
quarterly revenue during the last weeks of the quarter. These factors make it
difficult for us to forecast future sales and project quarterly revenues. The
difficulty in forecasting future sales impairs our ability to project our
inventory requirements, which could result, and in the past has resulted in
inventory write-downs or failure to timely meet customer product demands. In
addition, difficulty in forecasting revenues compromises our ability to provide
forward-looking revenue and earnings guidance.

Global economic conditions, the
economic conditions of the countries in which we operate and currency
fluctuations could have a material adverse affect on our business and negatively
impact our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to our U.S. operations, we
also have significant international operations, including foreign sales offices
to support our international customers and distributors, our regional
headquarters in Ireland and Singapore and a research and development site in
India. In connection with the restructuring we announced in April 2009, we
expect our international operations to grow as we relocate certain operations
and administrative functions. Sales and operations outside of the U.S. subject
us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and
regulatory environments. Our financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which
we do significant business or by changes in foreign currency exchange rates
affecting those countries. The Company derives over one-half of its revenues
from international sales,


primarily in the Asia Pacific region,
Europe and Japan. Past and current economic weakness in these markets adversely
affected revenues. The timing and nature of economic recovery in these markets
as well as in the U.S. remains uncertain, and there can be no assurance that
global market conditions will improve in the near future.

Sales to all direct OEMs and distributors
are denominated in U.S. dollars. While the recent movement of the Euro and Yen
against the U.S. dollar had no material impact to our business, increased
volatility could impact our European and Japanese customers. Currency
instability and recent volatility and disruptions in the credit and capital
markets may increase credit risks for some of our customers and may impair our
customers' ability to repay existing obligations. Increased currency volatility
could also positively or negatively impact our foreign-currency-denominated
costs, assets and liabilities. In addition, devaluation of the U.S. dollar
relative to other foreign currencies may increase the operating expenses of our
foreign subsidiaries adversely affecting our results of operations. Furthermore,
because we are increasingly dependent on the global economy, instability in
worldwide economic environments occasioned, for example, by political
instability, terrorist activity or U.S. military actions could impact economic
activity and lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers. Any or
all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations in the future.

We are exposed to fluctuations in
interest rates and changes in credit rating and in the market values of our
portfolio investments which could have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Our cash, short-term and long-term
investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or
even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements, changes in credit
rating and financial market conditions. Since September 2007, the global credit
markets have experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the
values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities. The
global credit and capital markets have recently experienced further significant
volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system and
the current uncertainty related to global economic conditions. As of March 28,
2009, less than 7% of our $1.58 billion investment portfolio consisted of
asset-backed securities and approximately 11% of the portfolio consisted of
mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities consisted of student loan
auction rate securities and other asset-backed securities.

Approximately 4% of our investment
portfolio consisted of student loan auction rate securities and all of these
securities are rated AAA with the exception of approximately 14% that were
downgraded to A rating during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. More than 98%
of the underlying assets that secure the student loan auction rate securities
are pools of student loans originated under the Federal Family Education Loan
Program (FFELP) that are substantially guaranteed by the U.S. Department of
Education. These securities experienced failed auctions in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2008 due to liquidity issues in the global credit markets. In a failed
auction, the interest rates are reset to a maximum rate defined by the
contractual terms for each security. We have collected and expect to collect all
interest payable on these securities when due. During fiscal 2009, $1.4 million
of these student loan auction rate securities were redeemed for cash by the
issuers at par value. Beginning with the quarter ended March 29, 2008, the
student loan auction rate securities were reclassified from short-term to
long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets since there can be no
assurance of a successful auction in the future. The final maturity dates range
from March 2023 to November 2047.

All other asset-backed securities
comprised less than 3% of our investment portfolio as of March 28, 2009, of
which approximately 9% are AAA rated with the majority of the rest of the
asset-backed securities rated A or BBB. These asset-backed securities are
secured primarily by bank, finance and insurance company obligations,
collateralized loan and bank obligations, credit card debt and mortgage-backed
securities with no direct U.S. subprime mortgage exposure. Substantially all of
the other mortgage-backed securities in the investment portfolio are AAA rated,
were issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies and
represented approximately 11% of the investment portfolio as of March 28, 2009.
As a result of these recent adverse conditions in the global credit markets,
there is a risk that we may incur additional other-than-temporary impairment
charges for certain types of investments such as asset-backed securities should
the credit markets experience further deterioration or the underlying assets
fail to perform as anticipated due to the continued or worsening global economic
conditions. Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to
changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair values of our debt
securities is judged to be other than temporary. Furthermore, we may suffer
losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in
market value due to changes in interest rates or financial market conditions.
See “Note 4. Financial Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements,
included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for a table
of our available-for-sale securities.

We are subject to the risks
associated with conducting business operations outside of the U.S. which could
adversely affect our business.

In addition to international sales and
support operations and development activities, we purchase our wafers from
foreign foundries and have our commercial products assembled, packaged and
tested by subcontractors located outside the U.S. In connection with the
restructuring we announced in April 2009, we expect these subcontractor
activities to increase. All of these activities are subject to the uncertainties
associated with international business operations, including tax laws and
regulations, trade barriers, economic sanctions, import and export regulations,
duties and tariffs and other trade restrictions, changes in trade policies,
foreign governmental regulations, reduced protection for IP, longer receivable
collection periods and disruptions or delays in production or shipments, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and/or operating results. Additional factors that could adversely affect us due
to our international operations include rising oil prices and increased costs of
natural resources. Moreover, our financial condition and results of operations
could be affected in the event of political conflicts or economic crises in


countries where our main wafer
providers, end customers and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and
test services worldwide, are located. Adverse change to the circumstances or
conditions of our international business operations could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

Our success depends on our ability
to develop and introduce new products and failure to do so would have a material
adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our success depends in large part on
our ability to develop and introduce new products that address customer
requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price, density,
functionality, power consumption and performance. The success of new product
introductions is dependent upon several factors, including:

timely completion of new product designs;

ability to
  generate new design opportunities or “design wins”;

availability
  of specialized field application engineering resources supporting demand
  creation and customer adoption of new products;

ability to
  utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies on circuit geometries of
  65nm and smaller;

achieving
  acceptable yields;

ability to
  obtain adequate production capacity from our wafer foundries and assembly and
  test subcontractors;

ability to
  obtain advanced packaging;

availability
  of supporting software design tools;

utilization of
  predefined IP cores of logic;

customer
  acceptance of advanced features in our new products; and

market
  acceptance of our customers’ products.

Our product development efforts may not
be successful, our new products may not achieve industry acceptance and we may
not achieve the necessary volume of production that would lead to further per
unit cost reductions. Revenues relating to our mature products are expected to
decline in the future, which is normal for our product life cycles. As a result,
we may be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from design wins for our
newer products as well as anticipated cost reductions in the manufacture of our
current products. We rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and
corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on
introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and other
price/performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining
consistent margins. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product
introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our
products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our
financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

We are dependent on independent
foundries for the manufacture of all of our products and a manufacturing problem
or insufficient foundry capacity could adversely affect our
operations.

During fiscal 2009, nearly all of our
wafers were manufactured either in Taiwan, by UMC or in Japan, by Toshiba or
Seiko. Terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the
pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by
periodic negotiations between Xilinx and these wafer foundries, which usually
result in short-term agreements that do not provide for long-term supply or
allocation commitments. We are dependent on these foundries, especially UMC,
which supplies the substantial majority of our wafers. We rely on UMC to produce
wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes. These attributes
include an ability to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies
and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them
in a timely manner. We cannot guarantee that the foundries that supply our
wafers will not experience manufacturing problems, including delays in the
realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies or difficulties due
to limitations of new and existing process technologies. Furthermore, we cannot
guarantee the foundries will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our
products. In addition, current economic conditions may adversely impact the
financial health and viability of the foundries and result in their insolvency
or their inability to meet their commitments to us. The insolvency of a foundry
or any significant manufacturing problem or insufficient foundry capacity would
disrupt our operations and negatively impact our financial condition and results
of operations.

We have established other sources of
wafer supply for our products in an effort to secure a continued supply of
wafers. However, establishing, maintaining and managing multiple foundry
relationships requires the investment of management resources as well as
additional costs. If we do not manage these relationships effectively, it could
adversely affect our results of operations.

Increased costs of wafers and
materials, or shortages in wafers and materials, could adversely impact our
gross margins and lead to reduced revenues.

If greater demand for wafers produced
by the foundries is not offset by an increase in foundry capacity, or market
demand for wafers or production and assembly materials increases, our supply of
wafers and other materials could become limited. Such shortages raise the
likelihood of potential wafer price increases and wafer shortages or shortages
in materials at production and test facilities. Such


increases in wafer prices or materials
could adversely affect our gross margins and shortages of wafers and materials
would adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands.

Earthquakes and other natural
disasters could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse affect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

The independent foundries, upon which
we rely to manufacture our products, as well as our California and Singapore
facilities, are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other
natural disasters. UMC’s foundries in Taiwan and Toshiba’s and Seiko’s foundries
in Japan as well as many of our operations in California are centered in areas
that have been seismically active in the recent past and some areas have been
affected by other natural disasters. Any catastrophic event in these locations
will disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing activities. This type
of disruption could result in our inability to manufacture or ship products,
thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of
operations. Additionally, disruption of operations at these foundries for any
reason, including other natural disasters such as typhoons, fires or floods, as
well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas
or water could cause delays in shipments of our products, and could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We are dependent on independent
subcontractors for most of our assembly and test services and unavailability or
disruption of these services could negatively impact our financial condition and
results of operations.

We are also dependent on subcontractors
to provide semiconductor assembly, substrate, test and shipment services. Any
prolonged inability to obtain wafers with competitive performance and cost
attributes, adequate yields or timely delivery, any disruption in assembly, test
or shipment services, or any other circumstance that would require us to seek
alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material adverse
effect on our ability to meet customer demands. In addition, current economic
conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of these
subcontractors and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their
commitments to us. These factors would result in reduced net revenues and could
negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

If we are not able to successfully
compete in our industry, our financial results and future prospects will be
adversely affected.

Our PLDs compete in the logic IC
industry, an industry that is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid
technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and
continuous price erosion. We expect increased competition from our primary PLD
competitors, Altera, Lattice and Actel, from the ASIC market, which has been
ongoing since the inception of FPGAs, from the ASSP market, and from new
companies that may enter the traditional programmable logic market segment. We
believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include:

product pricing;

time-to-market;

product performance, reliability, quality, power
  consumption and density;

field upgradability;

adaptability of products to specific
  applications;

ease of use and functionality of software design
  tools;

availability and functionality of predefined IP
  cores of logic;

inventory management;

access to leading-edge process technology and
  assembly capacity; and

ability to provide timely customer service and
  support.

Our strategy for expansion in the logic
market includes continued introduction of new product architectures that address
high-volume, low-cost and low-power applications as well as high-performance,
high-density applications. In addition, we anticipate continued price reductions
proportionate with our ability to lower the cost for established products.
However, we may not be successful in achieving these strategies.

Other competitors include manufacturers
of:

high-density programmable logic products
  characterized by FPGA-type architectures;

high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable
  replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;

ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of
  embedded programmable logic;

high-speed, low-density CPLDs;

high-performance DSP devices;

products with embedded processors;

products with embedded multi-gigabit
  transceivers;

and

other new or emerging programmable logic products.


Several companies have introduced
products that compete with ours or have announced their intention to sell PLD
products. To the extent that our efforts to compete are not successful, our
financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

The benefits of programmable logic have
attracted a number of competitors to this segment. We recognize that different
applications require different programmable technologies, and we are developing
architectures, processes and products to meet these varying customer needs.
Recognizing the increasing importance of standard software solutions, we have
developed common software design tools that support the full range of our IC
products. We believe that automation and ease of design are significant
competitive factors in this segment.

We could also face competition from our
licensees. In the past we have granted limited rights to other companies with
respect to certain of our older technology, and we may do so in the future.
Granting such rights may enable these companies to manufacture and market
products that may be competitive with some of our older products.

Our failure to protect and defend
our intellectual property could impair our ability to compete
effectively.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trade
secret, mask work and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property. We
cannot provide assurance that such intellectual property rights can be
successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or
challenged. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors, have
asserted against us patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to
technologies that are important to us. Third parties may assert infringement
claims against our indemnitees or us in the future. Assertions by third parties
may result in costly litigation or indemnity claims and we may not prevail in
such matters or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third
parties on commercially reasonable terms. This could result in the loss of our
ability to import and sell our products. Any infringement claim, indemnification
claim, or impairment or loss of use of our intellectual property could
materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

We rely on information technology
systems, and failure of these systems to function properly could result in
business disruption.

We rely in part on various information
technology (IT) systems to manage our operations, including financial reporting,
and we regularly evaluate these systems and make changes to improve them as
necessary. Consequently, we periodically implement new, or enhance existing,
operational and IT systems, procedures and controls. For example, we recently
simplified our supply chain and were required to make certain changes to our IT
systems. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to,
new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to
record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate
basis. Further, these systems are subject to power and telecommunication outages
or other general system failure. Failure of our IT systems or difficulties in
managing them could result in business disruption.

If we are unable to maintain
effective internal controls, our stock price could be adversely
affected.

We are subject to the ongoing internal
control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act).
Our controls necessary for continued compliance with the Act may not operate
effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness disclosure. The
identification of material weaknesses in internal control, if any, could
indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements and
could cause investors to lose confidence and our stock price to drop. Further,
our internal control effectiveness may be impacted upon executing the
restructuring plan announced in April 2009 if we are unable to successfully
transfer certain control activities and responsibilities to new personnel in
different locations.

Unfavorable results of legal
proceedings could adversely affect our financial condition and operating
results.

From time to time we are subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of
our business. Certain claims are not yet resolved, including those that are
discussed in Item 3. “Legal

Proceedings,” included in Part I,

and additional claims may arise in
the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty.
Regardless of its merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to
our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management
attention and we may enter into material settlements to avoid these risks.
Should the Company fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of
these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be
faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that
would materially and adversely affect a portion of our business and might
materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.

Our products could have defects
which could result in reduced revenues and claims against us.

We develop complex and evolving
products that include both hardware and software. Despite our testing efforts
and those of our subcontractors, defects may be found in existing or new
products. These defects may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and
repair or replacement costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel
from our product development efforts and harm our


relationships with customers. Product
defects or other performance problems could result in the delay or loss of
market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business. Our
customers could also seek damages from us for their losses. A product liability
claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming
and costly to defend. Product liability risks are particularly significant with
respect to aerospace, automotive and medical applications because of the risk of
serious harm to users of these products. Any product liability claim, whether or
not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the
efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our
business.

In preparing our financial
statements, we make good faith estimates and judgments that may change or turn
out to be erroneous.

In preparing our financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, we must make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical
accounting policies. Those estimates and judgments have a significant impact on
the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The most
difficult estimates and subjective judgments that we make concern valuation of
marketable and non-marketable securities, revenue recognition, inventories,
long-lived assets, taxes, legal matters and stock-based compensation. We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. We also have other key
accounting policies that are not as subjective, and therefore, their application
would not require us to make estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but
which nevertheless could significantly affect our financial reporting. Actual
results may differ materially from these estimates. If these estimates or their
related assumptions change, our operating results for the periods in which we
revise our estimates or assumptions could be adversely and perhaps materially
affected.

We depend on distributors, primarily
Avnet, to generate a majority of our sales and complete order fulfillment.

Resale of product through Avnet
accounted for 55% of the Company’s worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2009 and as
of March 28, 2009, Avnet accounted for 81% of our total accounts receivable. In
addition, we are subject to concentrations of credit risk in our trade accounts
receivable, which includes accounts of our distributors. A significant reduction
of effort by a distributor to sell our products or a material change in our
relationship with one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end
customers and adversely affect our ability to sell our products. Furthermore, if
a key distributor materially defaults on a contract or otherwise fails to
perform, our business and financial results would suffer.

In addition, the financial health of
our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our
success. Current economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health
of some of these distributors, particularly our smaller distributors. This could
result in the insolvency of certain distributors, the inability of distributors
to obtain credit to finance the purchase of our products, or cause distributors
to delay payment of their obligations to us and increase our credit risk
exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial health of these
distributors impairs their performance and we are unable to secure alternate
distributors.

Reductions in the average selling
prices of our products could have a negative impact on our gross margins.

The average selling prices of our
products generally decline as the products mature. We seek to offset the
decrease in selling prices through yield improvement, manufacturing cost
reductions and increased unit sales. We also continue to develop higher value
products or product features that increase, or slow the decline of, the average
selling price of our products. However, there is no guarantee that our ongoing
efforts will be successful or that they will keep pace with the decline in
selling prices of our products, which could ultimately lead to a decline in
revenues and have a negative effect on our gross margins.

A number of factors can impact our
gross margins.

A number of factors, including our
product mix, market acceptance of our new products, competitive pricing
dynamics, geographic and/or market segment pricing strategies and various
manufacturing cost variables cause our gross margins to fluctuate. In addition,
forecasting our gross margins is difficult because the majority of our business
is based on turns within the same quarter.

If we do not successfully implement
the restructuring we announced in April 2009, our results of operations and
financial condition could be adversely impacted.

In April 2009, we announced
restructuring measures and a net reduction in our global workforce by up to 200
positions, which we expect to complete by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The
positions will be eliminated across a variety of functions and geographies
worldwide. The restructuring is designed to drive structural operating
efficiencies across the Company and will align our Company with the evolving
geographic distribution of our customers and supply chain. However, if we do not
successfully implement this restructuring, our results of operations and
financial condition could be adversely impacted. Factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to our announced
restructuring include:


the availability and hiring of the appropriately
  skilled workers in the Asia Pacific region;

the transition of testing and other operational
  matters to third parties; and/or

the timing and execution of our programs and plans
  related to the restructuring.

Considerable amounts of our common
shares are available for issuance under our equity incentive plans and
debentures, and significant issuances in the future may adversely impact the
market price of our common shares.

As of March 28, 2009, we had 2.00
billion authorized common shares, of which 275.5 million shares were
outstanding. In addition, 62.7 million common shares were reserved for issuance
pursuant to our equity incentive plans and 1990 Employee Qualified Stock
Purchase Plan (Employee Stock Purchase Plan), and 22.4 million shares were
reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the 3.125% convertible
debentures due March 15, 2037 (debentures). The availability of substantial
amounts of our common shares resulting from the exercise or settlement of equity
awards outstanding under our equity incentive plans or the conversion or
repurchase of debentures using common shares, which would be dilutive to
existing stockholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our
common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through
the sale of equity securities.

ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

Internal Revenue Service

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
audited and issued proposed adjustments to the Company’s tax returns for fiscal
1996 through 2001. The Company filed petitions with the Tax Court in response to
assertions by the IRS relating to fiscal 1996 through 2000. To date, all issues
have been settled with the IRS in this matter except as described in the
following paragraphs.

On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court
issued its opinion concerning whether the value of stock options must be
included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. The Tax Court agreed
with the Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost
sharing agreement, and thus, the Company had no tax, interest, or penalties due
for this issue. The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31, 2006. On August 25,
2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.


The Company and the IRS presented oral arguments to a three-judge panel of the Appeals Court on March 12, 2008.
On May 27, 2009, the Company received a 2-1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the Tax
Court decision and holding that the Company should include stock option amounts in its cost sharing agreement
with Xilinx Ireland.  The Company does not agree with the Appeals Court decision and is reviewing its
alternatives as a result of the decision.

The Company expects to record expense of $8.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal
2010 in order to reverse the interest income it accrued through March 28, 2009 on the
earlier prepayment it made to the IRS.  The Company is presently determining the amount
of penalties and interest to be accrued under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109” (FIN 48) in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of this decision.

In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a
statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal
2005. The Company filed a petition with the Tax Court on March 2, 2009, in
response to this notice of deficiency and plans to contest the proposed
adjustments. The Company believes it has provided adequate reserves for any tax
deficiencies that could result from this IRS action.

Patent Litigation

On December 28, 2007, a patent
infringement lawsuit was filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG (PACT) against the
Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall
Division (PACT XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No.
2:07-CV-563). The lawsuit pertains to 11 different patents and PACT seeks
injunctive relief, unspecified damages and interest and attorneys’ fees. Neither
the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to the Company is
estimable at this time.

On August 21, 2007, Lonestar
Inventions, L.P. (Lonestar) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Xilinx
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division
(Lonestar Inventions, L.P. v. Xilinx, Inc. Case No. 6:07-CV-393). The lawsuit
pertained to a single patent and Lonestar sought injunctive relief, unspecified
damages and interest and attorneys’ fees. The parties reached a confidential
agreement to settle the action and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on
December 18, 2008. The amount of the settlement did not have a material impact
on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Other Matters

From time to time, we are involved in
various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our
business. These include disputes and lawsuits related to intellectual property,
mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contract law, tax, regulatory, distribution
arrangements, employee relations and other matters. Periodically, we review the
status of each matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the
potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a
range of possible losses can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the
estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes
are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only
on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes
available, we continue to reassess the potential liability related to pending
claims and litigation and may revise estimates.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A
VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of
security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this
report.

Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities

The Company did not repurchase any of
its common stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The value of shares
or outstanding debentures that may yet be purchased under our current common
stock and debentures repurchase program is $525.7 million. See “Note 15.
Stockholders’ Equity” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item
8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for information regarding our
stock repurchase plans.

On February 25, 2008, we announced a
repurchase program of up to $800.0 million of common stock. On November 6, 2008,
our Board of Directors approved the amendment of the Company’s $800.0 million
stock repurchase program to provide that the funds may also be used to
repurchase outstanding debentures. This repurchase program has no stated
expiration date. Through March 28, 2009, the Company had used $274.3 million of
the $800.0 million authorized for the repurchase of its outstanding common stock
and debentures.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with
the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included
in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Cautionary Statement

The statements in this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis that are forward looking, within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, involve numerous risks and
uncertainties and are based on current expectations. The reader should not place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for
many reasons, including those risks discussed under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere
in this document. Often, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use
of forward-looking words, such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,”
“believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “continue,” “plan,” “intend,” “project” and
other similar terminology, or the negative of such terms.

We disclaim any
responsibility to update or revise any forward-looking statement provided in
this Management’s Discussion and Analysis for any reason.

Nature of Operations

We design, develop and market complete
programmable logic solutions, including advanced ICs, software design tools,
predefined system functions delivered as IP cores, design services, customer
training, field engineering and technical support. Our PLDs include FPGAs and
CPLDs. These devices are standard products that our customers program to perform
desired logic functions. Our products are designed to provide high integration
and quick time-to-market for electronic equipment manufacturers in end markets
such as wired and wireless communications, industrial, scientific and medical,
aerospace and defense, audio, video and broadcast, consumer, automotive and data
processing. We sell our products globally through independent domestic and
foreign distributors and through direct sales to OEMs by a network of
independent sales representative firms and by a direct sales management
organization.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The methods, estimates and judgments we
use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact
on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC has
defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to
make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need
to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this
definition, our critical accounting policies include: valuation of marketable
and non-marketable securities, which impacts losses on debt and equity
securities when we record impairments; revenue recognition, which impacts the
recording of revenues; and valuation of inventories, which impacts cost of
revenues and gross margin. Our critical accounting policies also include: the
assessment of impairment of long-lived assets including acquisition-related
intangibles, which impacts their valuation; the assessment of the recoverability
of goodwill, which impacts goodwill impairment; accounting for income taxes,
which impacts the provision or benefit recognized for income taxes, as well as
the valuation of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet;
and valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation, which impacts gross
margin, R&D expenses, and selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
expenses. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and
judgments involved. We also have other key accounting policies that are not as
subjective, and therefore, their application would not require us to make
estimates or judgments that are as difficult, but which nevertheless could
significantly affect our financial reporting.

Valuation of Marketable and Non-marketable Securities

The Company’s short-term and long-term
investments include marketable debt securities and non-marketable equity
securities. As of March 28, 2009, the Company had marketable debt securities
with a fair value of $1.24 billion and non-marketable equity securities in
private companies of $20.5 million (adjusted cost).

Beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal 2009, the assessment of fair value is based on the provisions of SFAS No.
157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157). The Company determines the fair
values for marketable debt and equity securities using industry standard pricing
services, data providers and other third-party sources and by performing
valuation analyses. See “Note 3. Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated
financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” for details of the valuation methodologies. In determining
if and when a decline in value below adjusted cost of marketable debt and equity
securities is other than temporary, the Company evaluates on an ongoing basis
the market conditions, trends of earnings, financial condition, credit ratings,
any underlying collateral and other key measures for our investments. We assess
other-than-temporary impairment of debt and equity securities in accordance with FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 115-1,
“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments.” We recorded other-than-temporary impairments for marketable debt
securities and a marketable equity security in fiscal 2009. We did not record
any other-than-temporary impairment for marketable debt or equity securities in
fiscal 2008 or 2007.


The Company’s investments in
non-marketable securities of private companies are accounted for by using the
cost method. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring
basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In determining
whether a decline in value of non-marketable equity investments in private
companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an assessment is made by
considering available evidence, including the general market conditions in the
investee’s industry, the investee’s product development status and subsequent
rounds of financing and the related valuation and/or our participation in such
financings. We also assess the investee’s ability to meet business milestones
and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the individual investee,
including the rate at which the investee is using its cash and the investee’s
need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation. Beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2009, the assessment of fair value is based on the
provisions of SFAS 157. The valuation methodology for determining the decline in
value of non-marketable equity securities is based on the factors noted above
which require management judgment and are Level 3 inputs. See “Note 3. Fair
Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements, included
in

Item 8.
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,”

f

or additional information relating to the
adoption of SFAS 157. When a decline in value is deemed to be other than
temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period’s
operating results to the extent of the decline. We recorded other-than-temporary
impairments for non-marketable equity securities in fiscal 2009, 2008 and
2007.

Revenue Recognition

Sales to distributors are made under
agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under
certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are
deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors’ end
customers. For fiscal 2009, approximately 77% of our net revenues were from
products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract
manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor
that product has been sold to the distributor’s end customer. Also reported by
the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment
information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on
hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. We maintain system
controls to validate distributor data and to verify that the reported
information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects
the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin
expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from
the Company. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory
is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from
Xilinx at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under
normal payment terms.

As of March 28, 2009, we had $90.4
million of deferred revenue and $28.0 million of deferred cost of goods sold
recognized as a net $62.4 million of deferred income on shipments to
distributors. As of March 29, 2008, we had $158.0 million of deferred revenue
and $46.3 million of deferred cost of goods sold recognized as a net $111.7
million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. The deferred income on
shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in our consolidated
statement of income will be different than the amount shown on the consolidated
balance sheet due to actual price adjustments issued to the distributors when
the product is sold to their end customers.

Revenue from sales to our direct
customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a
sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection
of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer
acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of
the periods presented, there were no significant formal acceptance provisions
with our direct customers.

Revenue from software licenses is
deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year.
Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed.
Revenue from Support Products, which includes software and services sales, was
less than 7% of net revenues for all of the periods presented.

Allowances for end customer sales
returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending
customer returns or allowances.

Valuation of Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of
actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or market
(estimated net realizable value). The valuation of inventory requires us to
estimate excess or obsolete inventory as well as inventory that is not of
saleable quality. We review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate
current actual manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for
product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of actual spending over
actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Given the cyclicality of the
market, the obsolescence of technology and product lifecycles, we write down
inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These
factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new
product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates
that may include uncertain elements. The estimates of future demand that we use
in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts,
which are also consistent with our short-term manufacturing plans. If our demand
forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to
reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write down
additional inventory, which would have a negative impact on our gross
margin.


Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Including Acquisition-Related Intangibles

Long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment
if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment indicators are reviewed
on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held
for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets.
In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the
recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated
fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to
the assets or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held
for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate positive cash
flows.

When assets are removed from operations
and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying
value of the assets over their fair value. Factors affecting impairment of
assets held for sale include market conditions. Changes in any of these factors
could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for
use or assets held for sale.

Long-lived assets such as goodwill,
other intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, are considered
nonfinancial assets, and are only measured at fair value when indicators of
impairment exist. The accounting and disclosure provisions of SFAS 157 will not
be effective for these assets until the first quarter of fiscal 2010. See “Note
3. Fair Value Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements, included
in

Item 8.
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,”

for additional information.

Goodwill

As required by SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142), goodwill is not amortized but is
subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators
of potential impairment exist, and goodwill is written down when it is
determined to be impaired. We perform an annual impairment review in the fourth
quarter of each fiscal year and compare the fair value of the reporting unit in
which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds
the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired. For
purposes of impairment testing under SFAS 142, Xilinx operates as a single
reporting unit. We use the quoted market price method to determine the fair
value of the reporting unit. Based on the impairment review performed during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal
2009. Unless there are indicators of impairment, our next impairment review for
goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
To date, no impairment indicators have been identified.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Xilinx is a multinational corporation
operating in multiple tax jurisdictions. We must determine the allocation of
income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions and
apply the appropriate tax rates for these jurisdictions. We undergo routine
audits by taxing authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions and
the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Tax audits often
require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax
adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with
different tax rates.

In determining income for financial
statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and
in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which
arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement
recognition of revenue and expense. Additionally, we must estimate the amount
and likelihood of potential losses arising from audits or deficiency notices
issued by taxing authorities. The taxing authorities’ positions and our
assessment can change over time resulting in a material effect on the provision
for income taxes in periods when these changes occur.

We must also assess the likelihood that
we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely,
we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve in the form of a
valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not
ultimately be recoverable.

The Company has elected to adopt the
alternative transition method provided in FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition
Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
Awards” for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to
SFAS 123(R). The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to
establish the beginning balance of the APIC pool related to the tax effects of
employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the
APIC pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of
employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of
SFAS 123(R).

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48. FIN 48 contains a two-step
approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS 109). The
first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the
weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the
position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax


benefit as the largest amount that is
more than 50% likely of being ultimately realized. See “Note 16. Income Taxes”
to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Stock-Based Compensation

In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we
adopted SFAS 123(R), which requires the measurement at fair value and
recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards.
Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of
stock-based awards at the date of grant requires judgment. We use the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock
options and rights to purchase shares under the Company’s Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Option pricing
models, including the Black-Scholes model, also require the use of input
assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected
dividend rate, expected forfeiture rate and expected risk-free rate of return.
We use implied volatility based on traded options in the open market as we
believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better
indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the
appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered: the volume of market
activity of traded options, and determined there was sufficient market activity;
the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those
of options granted by the Company, such as date of grant and the exercise price,
and determined the input assumptions were comparable; and the length of term of
traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally one to two
years and which was extrapolated to match the expected term of the employee
options granted by the Company, and determined the length of the option term was
reasonable. The expected life of options granted is based on the historical
exercise activity as well as the expected disposition of all options
outstanding. We will continue to review our input assumptions and make changes
as deemed appropriate depending on new information that becomes available.
Higher volatility and expected lives result in a proportional increase to
stock-based compensation determined at the date of grant. The expected dividend
rate and expected risk-free rate of return do not have as significant an effect
on the calculation of fair value.

In addition, SFAS 123(R) requires us to
develop an estimate of the number of stock-based awards which will be forfeited
due to employee turnover. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate
have an effect on reported stock-based compensation, as the effect of adjusting
the rate for all expense amortization after April 1, 2006 is recognized in the
period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual forfeiture rate is
higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to
increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the
expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is
lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease
the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense
recognized in the financial statements. The effect of forfeiture adjustments in
fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was insignificant. The expense we recognize in future
periods could also differ significantly from the current period and/or our
forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates.

The 1% decline in net revenues in
fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was largely due to the recessionary
environment we experienced during the fiscal year which impacted our sales
across a broad base of end markets. New Product revenue increased considerably
in fiscal 2009 but not enough to fully offset the declines in Base and
Mainstream Products. Total unit sales declined in fiscal 2009 but average
selling price per unit increased compared to the comparable prior year period.
The relatively flat net revenues in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was
driven by strong customer demand for our New Products which was offset by
decreased demand for our Mainstream and Base Products, particularly in the
Communications and Data Processing end markets. Increased total unit sales
during fiscal 2008 compared to the comparable prior year period were offset by
declines in average unit selling prices, which also contributed to the flat net
revenues in fiscal 2008. See “Net Revenues by Product” and “Net Revenues by End
Markets” below for more information on our product and end-market
categories.

No end customer accounted for more than
10% of net revenues for any of the periods presented.

Net
Revenues by Product

We classify our product offerings into
four categories: New, Mainstream, Base and Support Products. These product
categories, excluding Support Products, are modified on a periodic basis to
better reflect advances in technology. The most recent adjustment was made on
July 2, 2006, which was the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal 2007. New
Products, as currently defined, include our most recent product offerings and
include the Virtex-5, Virtex-4, Spartan-3 and CoolRunner-II product families.
Mainstream Products include the Virtex-II, Spartan-II, CoolRunner and Virtex-E
product families. Mainstream products are generally several years old and
designed into customer programs that are currently shipping in full production.
Base

Products consist of our older product families including the Virtex,
Spartan, XC4000 and XC9500 products. Support Products make up the remainder of
our product offerings and include configuration products, software, IP cores,
customer training, design services and support. In fiscal 2010, we expect to
reclassify our net revenues by product categories to better reflect the age of
the products and advances in technologies.

Net revenues from New Products
increased significantly in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year period due to
continued strong market acceptance of these products, primarily Virtex-5,
Virtex-4 and Spartan-3E. In fiscal 2009, Virtex-5 sales nearly tripled and net
revenues from our Virtex-4 and Spartan-3 product families each grew in double
digits. These products, along with our CoolRunner-II family of CPLDs,
contributed to the majority of the revenue growth in New Products in fiscal
2008. We expect sales of New Products to continue to increase over time as more
customers’ programs go into volume production with our 65-nm and 90-nm
products.

Net revenues from Mainstream Products
declined in fiscal 2009 and 2008 primarily due to a decline in sales of some of
our older generation products that were introduced to the market more than seven
years ago.

The decline in net revenues from Base
Products in fiscal 2009 and 2008 was expected since these products are mature
and approaching the end of life.

Net revenues from Support Products
decreased in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year period primarily due to a
decline in sales from our PROM products. Net revenues from Support Products
increased in fiscal 2008 due to modest increases in sales from our software
products.


Net Revenues by End Markets

Our end market revenue data is derived
from our understanding of our end customers’ primary markets. We classify our
net revenues by end markets into four categories: Communications, Industrial and
Other, Consumer and Automotive, and Data Processing. The percentage change
calculation in the table below represents the year-to-year dollar change in each
end market.

Net revenues from Communications, our
largest end market, increased in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year period
primarily due to the strength in wireless communication applications. Sales to
customers in the wireless space were particularly strong during fiscal 2009 as a
result of next generation wireless activity in China. In fiscal 2008, net
revenues from Communications decreased primarily due to decreased sales from
wireless communication applications, much of which was driven by merger and
consolidation activity in that market.

Net revenues from the Industrial and
Other end market increased in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period
due to strong sales growth from aerospace and defense and industrial, scientific
and medical applications. However, this growth was offset considerably by
weakness in test and measurement applications. In fiscal 2008, net revenues from
the Industrial and Other end market increased due to broad-based strength across
all applications including defense, industrial, scientific and medical and test
and measurement.

Net revenues from the Consumer and
Automotive end market decreased in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year
due to weaker sales from audio, video and broadcast and automotive applications,
which was partially offset by an increase in sales from consumer applications.
In fiscal 2008, net revenues from the Consumer and Automotive end market
increased primarily due to strength in automotive applications.

The decrease in net revenues from the
Data Processing end market in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period
was mainly driven by decreases in sales from computing and data processing
applications. In fiscal 2008, net revenues from the Data Processing end market
declined due to decreases in sales from storage as well as computing and data
processing applications.

Net
Revenues by Geography

Net revenues in North America decreased
in fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period primarily due to lower sales
from the Communications end market. The decrease in net revenues during fiscal
2008 was driven primarily by a decline in sales from wireless communications as
well as data processing applications.

Net revenues in Asia Pacific increased
in double digits during fiscal 2009, driven by strength in the Communications
end market, primarily from next generation wireless applications in China. The
increase in net revenues in fiscal 2008 was due to broad-based end market
strength, with particular strength coming from customers in the Communications
and Industrial and Other end markets. Asia Pacific sales continued to benefit
from outsourcing of manufacturing operations by large U.S. and European-based
customers to the Asia Pacific region.

Net revenues in Europe increased in
fiscal 2009 compared with the prior year period primarily due to strength in
wireless communication applications. Net revenues decreased in fiscal 2008
primarily due to lower sales from wireless communication
applications.


Net revenues in Japan decreased in
fiscal 2009 compared to the same period last year due to broad-based weakness
across most end market categories with the exception of the Consumer and
Automotive end market. The fiscal 2008 decline was due to broad-based weakness
across all end market categories.

The increase in the gross margin
percentage in fiscal 2009 from the comparable prior year period was driven
primarily by product cost reductions, higher average selling prices per unit,
stabilization of our New Products and improved operational
efficiency.

The increase in the gross margin
percentage in fiscal 2008 from the comparable prior year period was driven
primarily by product cost reductions and improved operational efficiency. This
favorable impact was partially offset by the product mix effect of New Product
growth year-over-year. New Products generally have lower gross margins than
Mainstream and Base Products in the early product life cycle due to higher unit
costs resulting from lower yields. As a percentage of total net revenues, New
Product sales increased by approximately 10% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal
2008.

Gross margin may be affected in the
future due to mix shifts, competitive-pricing pressure, manufacturing-yield
issues and wafer pricing. We expect to mitigate any adverse impacts from these
factors by continuing to improve yields on our New Products and by improving
manufacturing efficiencies.

Sales of inventory previously written
off were not material during fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007.

In order to compete effectively, we
pass manufacturing cost reductions on to our customers in the form of reduced
prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable margins. Price erosion is
common in the semiconductor industry, as advances in both product architecture
and manufacturing process technology permit continual reductions in unit cost.
We have historically been able to offset much of this revenue decline in our
mature products with increased revenues from newer products.

to support our investments in new product development.

R&D spending decreased $30.0
million or 8% during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease was
primarily due to reduced stock-based compensation expense and lower mask and
wafer spending, coupled with lower cost related to our R&D center in
India.

We plan to continue to selectively
invest in R&D efforts in areas such as new products and more advanced
process development, IP cores and the development of new design and layout
software. We will also consider acquisitions to complement our strategy for
technology leadership and engineering resources in critical areas.

attributable to lower stock-based compensation expense, reduced discretionary
spending and lower sales commissions. The reductions in discretionary spending
included consulting, travel and marketing expenses.

approximately $1.5 million for fiscal 2010 compared with $5.3 million for fiscal
2009.

Restructuring Charges

In June 2008, we announced a functional
reorganization pursuant to which we eliminated 249 positions, or approximately
7% of our global workforce. These employee terminations occurred across various
geographies and functions worldwide. The reorganization plan was completed by
the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

We recorded total restructuring charges
of $22.0 million in connection with the reorganization. These charges consisted
of $19.5 million of severance pay and benefits expenses which were recorded in
the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and $2.5 million of facility-related costs and
severance benefits expenses which were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal
2009.

The remaining accrual as of March 28, 2009 relates to facility-related costs
that are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms of the closed
facilities expiring at various dates through December 2012.

We estimate that severance and benefits
expenses incurred to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately
$35.0 million, including approximately $30.0 million of cash savings before
taxes and approximately $5.0 million of stock-based compensation expense. We
began realizing the majority of these savings, primarily within the SG&A and
R&D expense categories, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.
There can be no assurance that these expected future savings will be completely
realized as they may be partially offset by increases in other expenses.

See “Note 21. Subsequent Events” to our
consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” for information relating to a restructuring announced on
April 15, 2009.

Litigation Settlement

On November 27, 2006, the Company
settled a patent infringement lawsuit under which the Company agreed to pay $6.5
million. The plaintiff agreed to dismiss the patent infringement lawsuit with
prejudice, granted a patent license to the Company and executed an agreement not
to sue the Company under any patent owned or controlled by the plaintiff for ten
years. As a result of the settlement agreement, we recorded a current period
charge of $2.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. The remaining
balance of $4.0 million represented the value of the prepaid patent license
granted as part of the settlement. This balance is being amortized over the
patent’s remaining useful life of nine years.

The $11.9 million decrease in
stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2009 was due to a decrease in the
number of shares granted, declining weighted-average fair values of stock awards
vesting and an increase in the number of shares cancelled due to the June 2008
restructuring. The $26.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense
for fiscal 2008 was due to a decrease in the number of shares granted, declining
weighted-average fair values of stock awards vesting and lower expense related
to a methodology change from accelerated to straight-line amortization in
connection with the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Total stock-based compensation
expense during fiscal 2007 related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) was $90.3
million, excluding one-time expense of $2.2 million relating to prior years
under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations, using
the intrinsic value method.

In June 2006, stockholder derivative
complaints were filed against the Company concerning the Company’s historical
option-granting practices and the SEC initiated an informal inquiry on the
matter. An investigation of the Company’s historical stock option-granting
practices was conducted by outside counsel and no evidence of fraud, management
misconduct or manipulation in the timing or exercise price of stock option
grants was found. The investigation determined that in nearly all cases, stock
options were issued as of pre-set dates; however, there were some minor
differences between the recorded grant dates and measurement dates for certain
grants made between 1997 and 2006. As a result, a $2.2 million charge was taken
to the Company’s earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Subsequently the
SEC informal inquiry was terminated and no enforcement action was recommended
and the stockholder derivative complaints were dismissed.

The income tax effect of the charge
resulted in a benefit of $650 thousand, which was recorded to income tax
expense. The Company assessed the implications of applicable income tax rules
that may affect the Company. The tax benefit recorded is net of such potential
costs.

Gain on Early Extinguishment of
Convertible Debentures

In the third and fourth quarters of
fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million in cash to repurchase $310.4 million
(principal amount) of our debentures and recognized a gain on early
extinguishment of convertible debentures of $110.6 million, net of the write-off
of the pro rata portions of unamortized debt issuance costs ($5.8 million) and
unamortized derivative valuation ($736 thousand). Accrued interest paid at the
time of repurchases totaled $2.4 million.

During fiscal 2009, we recorded total
impairment losses related to senior class asset-backed securities of $38.0
million, which represented the original purchase price of these securities,
excluding accrued interest. The senior class asset-backed securities were
partially written off in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 due to default by the
issuer in October 2008. At the time of the initial write-off of $19.8 million in
the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we understood, based on the issuer’s
prospectus disclosures that investors would be repaid proportionally and without
preference. In October 2008, the issuer went into receivership. The receiver
subsequently sought judicial interpretation of a provision of a legal document
governing the issuer’s securities. As a result of the outcome of the judicial
determination, the receiver immediately liquidated the substantial majority of
the issuer’s assets, and in accordance with the court order, the proceeds were
used to repay short-term liabilities in the order in which they fell due. In
December 2008, the receiver reported to the issuer’s creditors the outcome of
the judicial determination and that the issuer’s liabilities substantially
exceeded its assets. As a result, the receiver estimated that the issuer would
not be able to pay any liabilities falling due after October 2008 regardless of
the seniority or status of the securities. Our investments in these senior class
asset-backed securities mature in September 2009 and September 2010. Based on
these new developments, we concluded that we are not likely to recover
the


During the second quarter of fiscal
2009, the issuer of one of the marketable debt securities in our investment
portfolio filed for bankruptcy resulting in a significant decline in the fair
value of this security. The original purchase price of this security, excluding
accrued interest, was $10.0 million. Based upon the available market and
financial data for the issuer, the decline in market value was deemed to be
other than temporary and we recorded impairment losses of $9.0 million,
including $8.4 million in the second quarter and $600 thousand in the third
quarter of fiscal 2009.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009,
we recognized an additional impairment loss of $1.0 million on marketable debt
securities in our investment portfolio.

During fiscal 2009, we recognized a
$3.1 million impairment loss as a result of a continuous decline that began in
fiscal 2008 in the market value of our investment in a marketable equity
security. We believed that the decline in the market value was other than
temporary and it was deemed to be worthless as of September 27, 2008. We
recognized an impairment loss on our investment in this marketable equity
security during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2009.

We recorded impairment losses of $3.0
million, $2.9 million and $2.0 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, related to our investment in non-marketable equity securities in
private companies. These impairment losses resulted primarily from weak
financial conditions of certain investees, certain investees diluting our
investment through the receipt of additional rounds of investment at a lower
valuation or from the liquidation of certain investees.

The decrease in interest and other
income, net in fiscal 2009 over the prior year was due primarily to a decrease
in interest rates and a smaller investment portfolio. The average interest rate
yield decreased by approximately 200 basis points (two percentage points)
year-over-year. The decrease in interest and other income, net in fiscal 2008
over fiscal 2007 was due to the interest expense ($32.0 million) related to the
debentures issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 as well as a loss of
approximately $4.7 million from the sale of the Company’s remaining UMC
investment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. These decreases were partially
offset by an increase in interest income of $13.6 million in fiscal 2008 over
fiscal 2007 due to higher yields resulting from investing in taxable securities
and a larger investment portfolio. See “Note 12. Interest and Other Income,

The effective tax rates in all years
reflected the favorable impact of foreign income at statutory rates less than
the U.S. rate and tax credits earned.

The increase in the effective tax rate
in fiscal 2009, when compared with fiscal 2008, was primarily due to the gain on
early extinguishment of debentures taxable at U.S. tax rates. The increase was
partially offset by the benefit of retroactive extension of the research credit
in fiscal 2009. On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of
2008 was signed into law. This legislation extended the federal research credit
through the end of calendar 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate in
fiscal 2008, when compared with fiscal 2007, was primarily due to items unique
to fiscal 2007 reducing the rates for the prior year period.

The IRS examined the Company’s tax
returns for fiscal 1996 through 2001.  All issues have been settled with
the exception of issues related to Xilinx U.S.’s cost sharing arrangement with
Xilinx Ireland.  On August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion
concerning whether the value of stock options must be included in the cost
sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland.  The Tax Court agreed with the
Company that no amount for stock options was to be included in the cost sharing
agreement.  Accordingly, there were no additional taxes, penalties or
interest due for this issue.  The Tax Court entered its decision on May 31,
2006.  On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed the decision to the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals.  On May 27, 2009, the Company received a 2-1
adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing the Tax Court decision
and holding that the Company should include stock option amounts in its cost
sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland.  The Company does not agree with the
Appeals Court decision and is reviewing its alternatives as a result of the
decision.  See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” included in Part I and “Note 16.
Income Taxes,” “Note 18. Litigation Settlements and Contingencies,” and “Note
21. Subsequent Events” to our consolidated financial statements, included in

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources

We have historically used a combination
of cash flows from operations and equity and debt financing to support ongoing
business activities, acquire or invest in critical or complementary
technologies, purchase facilities and capital equipment, repurchase our common
stock and debentures under our repurchase program, pay dividends and finance
working capital. Additionally, our investments in debt securities are available
for future sale.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal

Cash, Cash
Equivalents and Short-term and Long-term Investments

The combination of cash, cash
equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of March 28, 2009 and
March 29, 2008 totaled $1.67 billion and $1.86 billion, respectively. As of
March 28, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of
$1.32 billion and working capital of $1.52 billion. Cash provided by operations
of $442.5 million for fiscal 2009 was $138.5 million lower than the $581.0
million generated during fiscal 2008. Cash provided by operations during fiscal
2009 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items,
an increase in deferred income taxes and a decrease in accounts receivable,
which were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and deferred
income on shipments to distributors.

Net cash provided by investing
activities was $274.5 million during fiscal 2009, as compared to $192.0 million
in fiscal 2008. Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009
consisted of $314.4 million of net proceeds from the sale and maturity of
available-for-sale securities. These items were partially offset by $39.1
million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further discussion
below) and $793 thousand of other investing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities
was $518.1 million in fiscal 2009, as compared to $541.9 million in fiscal 2008.
Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2009 consisted of $193.2
million for the repurchase of debentures, $275.0 million for the repurchase of
common stock and $154.5 million for dividend payments to stockholders. These
items were partially offset by $99.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of
common stock under employee stock plans and $4.8 million for excess tax benefits
from stock-based compensation.

Accounts

Receivable

Accounts receivable, net of allowances
for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments
decreased 13% from $249.1 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to $216.4 million at
the end of fiscal 2009. Days sales outstanding decreased to 43 days as of March
28, 2009 from 49 days as of March 29, 2008. The decreases were primarily
attributable to a decrease in net shipments and weaker linearity of shipments at
the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 compared to the end of the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2008.

Inventories

Inventories decreased from $130.3
million as of March 29, 2008 to $119.8 million as of March 28, 2009. The
combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution channel decreased to 80 days
as of March 28, 2009, compared to 94 days as of March 29, 2008. The decreases
were primarily due to lower inventory at Xilinx and in the distributor channel
as a result of declining revenues due to lower anticipated demand and more
effective inventory management processes.

We attempt to maintain sufficient
levels of inventory in various product, package and speed configurations in
order to keep lead times short and to meet forecasted customer demand.
Conversely, we also attempt to minimize the handling costs associated with
maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for
cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process
advancements. We continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide
excellent customer response at a competitive cost.

Property, Plant and Equipment

During fiscal 2009, we invested $39.1
million in property, plant and equipment compared to $45.6 million in fiscal
2008. Primary investments in fiscal 2009 were for building improvements, test
equipment, computer equipment and software. We expect that property, plant and
equipment expenditures will decrease in the near future due to expense controls
and the current recessionary economic environment.


Current Liabilities

Current liabilities decreased from
$340.7 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to $233.1 million at the end of fiscal
2009. The decrease was primarily due to the decreases in income taxes payable
and deferred income on shipments to distributors. The decrease in deferred
income on shipments to distributors was due to a decrease in distributor
inventories as of March 28, 2009 compared to the prior year.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stockholders’ equity increased $66.1
million during fiscal 2009, from $1.67 billion in fiscal 2008 to $1.74 billion
in fiscal 2009. The increase in stockholders’ equity was attributable to net
income of $375.6 million for fiscal 2009, the issuance of common stock under
employee stock plans and other of $96.4 million, stock-based compensation
related amounts totaling $54.1 million and the related tax benefits associated
with stock option exercises and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $4.2
million. The increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock
of $275.0 million, the payment of dividends to stockholders of $154.5 million,
an adjustment to the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 of $10.1 million,
unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, net of deferred tax
benefits, of $14.9 million, cumulative translation adjustment of $7.7 million
and unrealized hedging transaction losses totaling $2.0 million.

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term and Long-term Investments

The combination of cash, cash
equivalents and short-term and long-term investments as of March 29, 2008 and
March 31, 2007 totaled $1.86 billion and $1.81 billion, respectively. As of
March 29, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of
$1.30 billion and working capital of $1.48 billion. Cash provided by operations
of $581.0 million for fiscal 2008 was $29.4 million higher than the $551.6
million generated during fiscal 2007. Cash provided by operations during fiscal
2008 resulted primarily from net income as adjusted for non-cash related items,
decreases in inventories and prepaid expenses and increases in income taxes
payable and deferred income on shipments to distributors which were partially
offset by an increase in accounts receivable.

The decrease in prepaid expenses in
fiscal 2008 was primarily related to the utilization of the advance wafer
purchase payment paid to Toshiba. In October 2004, we entered into an advanced
purchase agreement with Toshiba under which the Company paid Toshiba a total of
$100.0 million for advance payment of silicon wafers produced under the
agreement, which expired in December 2006 and was extended until December 2008.
The entire advance payment of $100.0 million was reduced by wafer purchases from
Toshiba. As of March 29, 2008, the unused balance of the advance payment
remaining was $4.5 million.

Net cash provided by investing
activities was $192.0 million during fiscal 2008, as compared to net cash used
in investing activities of $283.8 million in fiscal 2007. Net cash provided by
investing activities during fiscal 2008 consisted of $232.2 million of net
proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities, including
$47.1 million of net proceeds from the sale of the remaining UMC investment, and
a distribution from UMC of $10.7 million. These items were partially offset by
$45.6 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment (see further
discussion below) and $5.3 million of other investing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities
was $541.9 million in fiscal 2008, as compared to $415.3 million in fiscal 2007.
Net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2008 consisted of $550.0
million for the repurchase of common stock and $140.0 million for dividend
payments to stockholders. These items were partially offset by $125.6 million of
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $22.5
million for excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

Accounts

Receivable

Accounts receivable, net of allowances
for doubtful accounts, customer returns and distributor pricing adjustments
increased 37% from $182.3 million at the end of fiscal 2007 to $249.1 million at
the end of fiscal 2008. Days sales outstanding increased to 49 days as of March
29, 2008 from 36 days as of March 31, 2007. The increases were primarily
attributable to the timing of payments from customers, credit issuance and the
timing of shipments during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

Inventories

Inventories decreased from $174.6
million as of March 31, 2007 to $130.3 million as of March 29, 2008. The
combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution channel decreased to 94 days
as of March 29, 2008, compared to 112 days as of March 31, 2007. The decreases
were primarily due to improved forecasting accuracy and fewer inventory mix
issues.


Property, Plant and Equipment

During fiscal 2008, we invested $45.6
million in property, plant and equipment compared to $110.8 million in fiscal
2007. Primary investments in fiscal 2008 were for computer equipment, software,
test equipment, and building and leasehold improvements. The decrease in fiscal
2008 was primarily attributable to the accumulated construction costs incurred
in fiscal 2007 in connection with our Asia Pacific regional headquarters
building in Singapore, which was completed in June 2007, and the purchase in
February 2007 of a parcel of land for $28.6 million near our headquarters in San
Jose for future potential growth purposes, neither of which was repeated in
fiscal 2008. We do not intend to build on the land for the foreseeable
future.

Current Liabilities

Current liabilities increased from
$303.4 million at the end of fiscal 2007 to $340.7 million at the end of fiscal
2008. The increase was primarily due to the increases in deferred income on
shipments to distributors and accrued payroll and related liabilities, which
were partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable. The increase in
deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to an increase in
distributor inventories at March 29, 2008 compared to the prior year.

Stockholders’ Equity

Stockholders’ equity decreased $100.9
million during fiscal 2008, from $1.77 billion in fiscal 2007 to $1.67 billion
in fiscal 2008. The decrease in stockholders’ equity was attributable to the
repurchase of common stock of $550.0 million, the payment of dividends to
stockholders of $140.0 million and unrealized losses on available-for-sale
securities, net of deferred tax benefits, of $1.8 million. The decreases were
partially offset by net income of $374.0 million for fiscal 2008, the issuance
of common stock under employee stock plans of $124.7 million, stock-based
compensation related amounts totaling $65.8 million, the related tax benefits
associated with stock option exercises and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of
$15.8 million, the effect of the adoption of FIN 48 totaling $6.5 million,
cumulative translation adjustment of $3.1 million and hedging transaction gains
totaling $1.0 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash generated from operations is used
as our primary source of liquidity and capital resources. Our investment
portfolio is also available for future cash requirements as is our $250.0
million revolving credit facility entered into in April 2007. We are not aware
of any lack of access to the revolving credit facility; however, we can provide
no assurance that access to the credit facility will not be impacted by adverse
conditions in the financial markets. Our credit facility is not reliant upon a
single bank. There have been no borrowings to date under our existing revolving
credit facility. We also have a shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant
to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt, equity and other
securities in the future to augment our liquidity and capital
resources.

We used $275.0 million of cash to
repurchase 10.8 million shares of our common stock in fiscal 2009 compared with
$550.0 million used to repurchase 23.5 million shares in fiscal 2008. In
addition, during fiscal 2009, we paid $193.2 million of cash to repurchase
$310.4 million (principal amount) of our debentures resulting in a net gain on
early extinguishment of debentures of $110.6 million. During fiscal 2009, we
paid $154.5 million in cash dividends to stockholders, representing an aggregate
amount of $0.56 per common share. During fiscal 2008, we paid $140.0 million in
cash dividends to stockholders, representing an aggregate amount of $0.48 per
common share. In addition, on April 21, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a
cash dividend of $0.14 per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
The dividend is payable on June 3, 2009 to stockholders of record on May 13,
2009. Our common stock and debentures repurchase program and dividend policy
could be impacted by, among other items, our views on potential future capital
requirements relating to R&D, investments and acquisitions, legal risks,
principal and interest payments on our debentures and other strategic
investments.

The global credit crisis has imposed
exceptional levels of volatility and disruption in the capital markets, severely
diminished liquidity and credit availability, and increased counterparty risk.
Nevertheless, we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flows
from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable
future. We will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain
additional wafer capacity, procurement of additional capital equipment and
facilities, development of new products, and potential acquisitions of
technologies or businesses that could complement our business. However, the risk
factors discussed in Item 1A included in Part I and below could affect our cash
positions adversely. In addition, certain types of investments such as
asset-backed securities may present risks arising from liquidity and/or credit
concerns. In the event that our investments in auction rate securities and
senior class asset-backed securities become illiquid, we do not expect this will
materially affect our liquidity and capital resources or results of
operations.

As of March 28, 2009, marketable
securities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs were comprised of $58.4
million of student loan auction rate securities and $36.5 million of
asset-backed securities within our available-for-sale investment portfolio. The
amount of assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3) as a percentage of the total assets and liabilities measured at fair
value was less than 6% as of March 28, 2009. See “Note 3. Fair Value
Measurements” to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8.
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information.
Auction failures


during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2008 and the lack of market activity and liquidity required that our student
loan auction rate securities be measured using observable market data and Level
3 inputs. The fair values of our student loan auction rate securities were based
on our assessment of the underlying collateral and the creditworthiness of the
issuers of the securities. More than 98% of the underlying assets that secure
the student loan auction rate securities are pools of student loans originated
under FFELP that are substantially guaranteed by the U.S. Department of
Education. The fair values of our student loan auction rate securities were
determined using a discounted cash flow pricing model that incorporated
financial inputs such as projected cash flows, discount rates, expected interest
rates to be paid to investors and an estimated liquidity discount. The
weighted-average life over which cash flows were projected was determined to be
approximately nine years, given the collateral composition of the securities.
The discount rates that were applied to the pricing model were based on market
data and information for comparable- or similar-term student loan asset-backed
securities. The discount rates increased by approximately 215 to 300 basis
points (2.15 and 3.00 percentage points) in fiscal 2009 due to a widening of
credit spreads and increased liquidity discount as a result of the global credit
crisis noted above. The expected interest rate to be paid to investors in a
failed auction was determined by the contractual terms for each security. The
liquidity discount represents an estimate of the additional return an investor
would require to compensate for the lack of liquidity of the student loan
auction rate securities. We have the ability and intent to hold the student loan
auction rate securities until anticipated recovery, which could be at final
maturity that ranges from March 2023 to November 2047. All of the Company’s
student loan auction rate securities are rated AAA with the exception of $8.1
million that were downgraded to A rating during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2009.

Our $36.5 million of senior class
asset-backed securities are secured primarily by bank, finance and insurance
company obligations, collateralized loan and bank obligations, credit card debt
and mortgage-backed securities with no direct U.S. subprime mortgage exposure.
The $36.5 million of senior class asset-backed securities were measured using
observable market data and Level 3 inputs due to the lack of market activity and
liquidity. The fair values of these senior class asset-backed securities were
based on our assessment of the underlying collateral and the creditworthiness of
the issuers of the securities. We determined the fair values for the $36.5
million of senior class asset-backed securities by using prices from pricing
services that could not be corroborated by observable market data. We
corroborated the prices from the pricing services using comparable benchmark
indexes and securities prices. We have the ability and intent to hold the $36.5
million of senior class asset-backed securities until final maturity in November
2009. The $36.5 million of senior class asset-backed securities were downgraded
by at least one credit rating agency during the past two fiscal quarters and are
currently rated or split rated between AAA and BBB rating.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal
      2005, the Company committed up to $20.0 million to acquire, in the future,
      rights to intellectual property until July 2023. This commitment was
      reduced to $5.0 million in May 2009. License payments will be amortized
      over the useful life of the intellectual property acquired.

(5)

In March 2007, the Company issued
      $1.00 billion principal amount of 3.125% debentures due March 15, 2037. As
      a result of the repurchases in fiscal 2009, the remaining carrying value
      of the debentures on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of March
      28, 2009 was $690.1 million. The debentures require payment of interest at
      an annual rate of 3.125% payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15
      of each year, beginning September 15, 2007. For purposes of this table we
      have assumed the principal of our debentures will be paid on March 15,
      2037. See “Note 14. Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility”
      to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial
      Statements and Supplementary Data,” for additional information about our
      debentures.

As of March 28, 2009, $80.7 million of
FIN 48 liabilities and related interest and penalties were classified as
long-term income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet. Due to the
inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows
associated with our FIN 48 liabilities as of March 28, 2009, we are unable to
reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing
authority. Therefore, FIN 48 liabilities have been excluded from the contractual
obligations table above.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

As of March 28, 2009, we did not have
any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii)
of SEC Regulation S-K.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

See “Note 2. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk” to our consolidated financial
statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,”
for information about recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected
dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial
statements.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk
relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of fixed income
securities with a fair value of approximately $1.24 billion as of March 28,
2009. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash
while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio
includes municipal bonds, floating rate notes, mortgage-backed securities,
asset-backed securities, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper,
corporate bonds, student loan auction rate securities and U.S. and foreign
government and agency securities. In accordance with our investment policy, we
place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of
credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer’s credit rating. These
securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if
market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 100 basis-point (one percentage
point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at March 28,
2009 and March 29, 2008 would have affected the fair value of our investment
portfolio by less than $6.0 million and $9.0 million, respectively.

Credit Market Risk

Since September 2007, the global credit
markets have experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the
values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities. The
global credit and capital markets have recently experienced further significant
volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system and
the current uncertainty related to global economic conditions. As a result of
these recent adverse conditions in the global credit markets, there is a risk
that we may incur additional other-than-temporary impairment charges for certain
types of investments such as asset-backed securities should the credit markets
experience further deterioration. See “Note 4. Financial Instruments” to our
consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” for additional information about our
investments.

Foreign Currency Exchange
Risk

Sales to all direct OEMs and
distributors are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Gains and losses on foreign currency
forward contracts that are designated as hedges of anticipated transactions, for
which a firm commitment has been attained and the hedged relationship has been
effective, are deferred and included in income or expenses in the same period
that the underlying transaction is settled. Gains and losses on any instruments
not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the
consolidated statements of income as they are incurred.


We enter into forward currency exchange
contracts to hedge our overseas operating expenses and other liabilities when
deemed appropriate. As of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008, we had the
following outstanding forward currency exchange contracts:

$

Effective beginning in the first
quarter of fiscal 2009, as part of our strategy to reduce volatility of
operating expenses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we expanded our
hedging program from a one-quarter forward outlook to a five-quarter forward
outlook for major foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses. The contracts
expire at various dates between April 2009 and April 2010. The net unrealized
gain or loss, which approximates the fair market value of the above contracts,
was immaterial as of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008.

Our investments in several of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
As the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated at each quarter
end during consolidation, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign
currency and the U.S. dollar increase or decrease the value of those
investments. These fluctuations are recorded within stockholders' equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Other
foreign-denominated assets and liabilities are revalued on a monthly basis with
gains and losses on revaluation reflected in net income. A hypothetical 10%
favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rates at March 28,
2009 and March 29, 2008 would have affected the annualized
foreign-currency-denominated operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by
less than $8.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively. In addition, a
hypothetical 10% favorable or unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange
rates compared to rates at March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008 would have affected
the value of foreign-currency-denominated cash and investments by less than $6.0
million as of each date.

TATEMENTS

Note 1. Nature of Operations

Xilinx designs, develops and markets
complete programmable logic solutions, including advanced integrated circuits,
software design tools, predefined system functions delivered as intellectual
property cores, design services, customer training, field engineering and
technical support. The wafers used to manufacture its products are obtained
primarily from independent wafer manufacturers located in Taiwan and Japan. The
Company is dependent on these foundries to produce and deliver silicon wafers on
a timely basis. The Company is also dependent on subcontractors, primarily
located in the Asia Pacific region, to provide semiconductor assembly, test and
shipment services. Xilinx is a global company with manufacturing and test
facilities in the United States, Ireland and Singapore and sales offices
throughout the world. The Company derives over one-half of its revenues from
international sales, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, Europe and
Japan.

Note 2. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Xilinx and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
after elimination of all intercompany transactions. The Company uses a 52- to
53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2009 was a
52-week year ended on March 28, 2009. Fiscal 2008 was a 52-week year ended on
March 29, 2008. Fiscal 2007 was a 52-week year ended on March 31, 2007. Fiscal
2010 will be a 53-week year ending on April 3, 2010. The third quarter of fiscal
2010 will be a 14-week quarter ending on January 2, 2010.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to, among
others, the useful lives of assets, assessment of recoverability of property,
plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill, inventory write-downs,
allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, stock-based compensation,
potential reserves relating to litigation and tax matters, valuation of certain
investments and derivative financial instruments as well as other accruals or
reserves. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences
may be material to the financial statements.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three
months or less. These investments consist of commercial paper, bank certificates
of deposit, money market funds and time deposits. Short-term investments consist
of municipal bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, U.S. and foreign
government and agency securities, floating rate notes, mortgage-backed
securities, asset-backed securities and bank certificates of deposit with
original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than
one year from the balance sheet date. Long-term investments consist of U.S. and
foreign government and agency securities, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed
securities, asset-backed securities, floating rate notes and municipal bonds
with remaining maturities greater than one year, unless the investments are
specifically identified to fund current operations, in which case they are
classified as short-term investments. As of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008,
long-term investments also included approximately $58.4 million and $71.9
million, respectively, of auction rate securities that experienced failed
auctions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. These auction rate securities are
secured primarily by pools of student loans originated under FFELP that are
substantially guaranteed by the U. S. Department of Education. Equity
investments are also classified as long-term investments since they are not
intended to fund current operations.

The Company maintains its cash balances
with various banks with high quality ratings, and investment banking and asset
management institutions. The Company manages its liquidity risk by investing in
a variety of money market funds, high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds,
municipal bonds and U.S. and foreign government and agency securities. This
diversification of investments is consistent with its policy to maintain
liquidity and ensure the ability to collect principal. The Company maintains an
offshore investment portfolio denominated in U.S. dollars with investments in
non-U.S. based issuers. All investments are made pursuant to corporate
investment policy guidelines. Investments include Euro commercial paper, Euro
dollar bonds, Euro dollar floating rate notes and offshore time deposits.

Management classifies investments as
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the time of purchase and re-evaluates
such designation at each balance sheet date, although classification is not
generally changed. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the
Company has the positive intent and the ability to hold the securities until
maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at cost adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such
amortization, as well as any interest on the


securities, is included in interest
income. No investments were classified as held-to-maturity as of March 28, 2009
or March 29, 2008. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with
the unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. See “Note
3. Fair Value Measurements” for information relating to the determination of
fair value. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are
included in interest and other income, net, and declines in value judged to be
other than temporary are included in impairment loss on investments. The cost of
securities matured or sold is based on the specific identification
method.

In determining whether a decline in
value of non-marketable equity investments in private companies is other than
temporary, the assessment is made by considering available evidence including
the general market conditions in the investee’s industry, the investee’s product
development status, the investee’s ability to meet business milestones and the
financial condition and near-term prospects of the individual investee,
including the rate at which the investee is using its cash and the investee’s
need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation. When a decline in
value is deemed to be other than temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment
loss in the current period’s operating results to the extent of the
decline.

Accounts Receivable

The allowance for doubtful accounts
reflects the Company’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts
receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on the aging of
Xilinx’s accounts receivable, historical experience, known troubled accounts,
management judgment and other currently available evidence. Xilinx writes off
accounts receivable against the allowance when Xilinx determines a balance is
uncollectible and no longer actively pursues collection of the
receivable.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of
actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method), or market
(estimated net realizable value) and are comprised of the following:

The Company reviews and sets standard
costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. The Company's
manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full
absorption of actual spending over actual volumes, adjusted for excess capacity.
Given the cyclicality of the market, the obsolescence of technology and product
lifecycles, the Company writes down inventory based on forecasted demand and
technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic
conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in
strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements.
Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a
material effect on recorded inventory values.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are
recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation for financial
reporting purposes is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets of three to five years for machinery, equipment,
furniture and fixtures and 15 to 30 years for buildings. Depreciation expense
totaled $55.6 million, $54.2 million and $56.0 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquisition-Related
Intangibles

The Company evaluates the carrying
value of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held
and used for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. Impairment
indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. When indicators of impairment
exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted
cash flows attributable to the assets. In the event such cash flows are not
expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the
assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected
discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets or based on appraisals.
When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, Xilinx estimates
impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their
fair value.

Goodwill

As required by SFAS 142, goodwill is
not amortized but is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis, or more
frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based
approach. All other intangible assets are amortized over their


estimated useful lives and assessed for
impairment under SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” Based on the impairment review performed during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2009, there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2009.
Unless there are indicators of impairment, the Company’s next impairment review
for goodwill will be performed and completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2010. To date, no impairment indicators have been identified.

Revenue Recognition

Sales to distributors are made under
agreements providing distributor price adjustments and rights of return under
certain circumstances. Revenue and costs relating to distributor sales are
deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors’ end
customers. For fiscal 2009, approximately 77% of Xilinx’s net revenues were from
products sold to distributors for subsequent resale to OEMs or their subcontract
manufacturers. Revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor
that product has been sold to the distributor’s end customer. Also reported by
the distributor are product resale price, quantity and end customer shipment
information, as well as inventory on hand. Reported distributor inventory on
hand is reconciled to deferred revenue balances monthly. The Company maintains
system controls to validate distributor data and to verify that the reported
information is accurate. Deferred income on shipments to distributors reflects
the effects of distributor price adjustments and the amount of gross margin
expected to be realized when distributors sell through product purchased from
the Company. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory
is relieved when title to inventories transfers, typically upon shipment from
Xilinx at which point Xilinx has a legally enforceable right to collection under
normal payment terms.

As of March 28, 2009, the Company had
$90.4 million of deferred revenue and $28.0 million of deferred cost of goods
sold recognized as a net $62.4 million of deferred income on shipments to
distributors. As of March 29, 2008, the Company had $158.0 million of deferred
revenue and $46.3 million of deferred cost of goods sold recognized as a net
$111.7 million of deferred income on shipments to distributors. The deferred
income on shipments to distributors that will ultimately be recognized in the
Company’s consolidated statement of income will be different than the amount
shown on the consolidated balance sheet due to actual price adjustments issued
to the distributors when the product is sold to their end customers.

Revenue from sales to Xilinx’s direct
customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a
sales arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection
of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, and there are no customer
acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations. For each of
the periods presented, there were no significant formal acceptance provisions
with Xilinx’s direct customers.

Revenue from software licenses is
deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the licenses of one year.
Revenue from support services is recognized when the service is performed.
Revenue from support products, which includes software and services sales, was
less than 7% of net revenues for all of the periods presented.

Allowances for end customer sales
returns are recorded based on historical experience and for known pending
customer returns or allowances.

Foreign Currency Translation

The U.S. dollar is the functional
currency for the Company’s Ireland and Singapore subsidiaries. Assets and
liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured
into U.S. dollars, and the resulting gains or losses are included in the
consolidated statements of income under interest and other income, net. The
remeasurement gains or losses were immaterial for fiscal 2009, 2008 and
2007.

The local currency is the functional
currency for each of the Company’s other wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries.
Assets and liabilities are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars
at month-end exchange rates and statements of income are translated at the
average monthly exchange rates. Exchange gains or losses arising from
translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities (i.e.,
cumulative translation adjustment) are included as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Derivative Financial Instruments

To reduce financial risk, the Company
periodically enters into financial arrangements as part of the Company’s ongoing
asset and liability management activities. Xilinx uses derivative financial
instruments to hedge fair values of underlying assets and liabilities or future
cash flows which are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company does
not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes. See “Note 5. Derivative Financial Instruments” for detailed
information about the Company’s derivative financial instruments.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development costs are
current period expenses and charged to expense as incurred.


Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has equity incentive plans
that are more fully discussed in “Note 6. Stock-Based Compensation Plans.”
Effective April 2, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires
the Company to measure the cost of all employee equity awards that are expected
to be exercised based on the grant-date fair value of those awards and to record
that cost as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is
required to perform service in exchange for the award (generally over the
vesting period of the award). SFAS 123(R) addresses all forms of stock-based
payment awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans,
stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. In addition, the
Company is required to record compensation expense (as previous awards continue
to vest) for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain
outstanding at the date of adoption. SFAS 123(R) requires cash flows resulting
from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing
activities. Excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions
for exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock
compensation costs for such options. The exercise price of employee stock
options is equal to the market price of Xilinx common stock (defined as the
closing trading price reported by The NASDAQ Global Select Market) on the date
of grant. Additionally, Xilinx’s employee stock purchase plan is deemed a
compensatory plan under SFAS 123(R). Accordingly, the employee stock purchase
plan is included in the computation of stock-based compensation
expense.

Under the modified-prospective method
of adoption for SFAS 123(R), the compensation cost recognized by the Company
beginning in fiscal 2007 includes (a) compensation cost for all stock-based
awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of April 1, 2006, based on the
grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123), and (b)
compensation cost for all stock-based awards granted subsequent to April 1,
2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 123(R). The Company uses the straight-line attribution method
to recognize stock-based compensation costs over the requisite service period of
the award for stock-based awards granted after April 1, 2006. For stock-based
awards granted prior to April 2, 2006, the Company continues to use the
accelerated amortization method consistent with the amounts previously disclosed
in the pro forma disclosure as prescribed by SFAS 123. Upon exercise,
cancellation or expiration of stock options, deferred tax assets for options
with multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each vesting period on a
first-in, first-out basis as if each award had a separate vesting period. To
calculate the excess tax benefits available for use in offsetting future tax
shortfalls as of the date of implementation, the Company followed the
alternative transition method discussed in FSP 123(R)-3.

Income Taxes

All income tax amounts reflect the use
of the liability method

under SFAS No. 109, as interpreted by FIN 48

.

Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future
tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes.

Product Warranty and Indemnification

The Company generally sells products
with a limited warranty for product quality. The Company provides an accrual for
known product issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The
following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's product warranty
liability, which is included in other accrued liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets:

The Company offers, subject to certain
terms and conditions, to indemnify certain customers and distributors for costs
and damages awarded against these parties in the event the Company’s hardware
products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights,
including patents, copyrights or trademarks. To a lesser extent, the Company may
from time-to-time offer limited indemnification with respect to its software
products. The terms and conditions of these indemnity obligations are limited by
contract, which obligations are typically perpetual from the effective date of
the agreement. The Company has historically received only a limited number of
requests for indemnification under these provisions and has not made any
significant payments pursuant to these provisions. The Company cannot estimate
the maximum amount of potential future payments, if any, that the Company may be
required to make as a result of these obligations due to the limited history of
indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to
be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. However,
there can be no assurances that the Company will not incur any financial
liabilities in the future as a result of these obligations.


Concentrations of Credit Risk

Avnet, one of the Company’s
distributors, distributes the substantial majority of the Company’s products
worldwide. As of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008, Avnet accounted for 81% and
83% of the Company’s total accounts receivable, respectively. Resale of product
through Avnet accounted for 55%, 61% and 67% of the Company’s worldwide net
revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The percentage of accounts
receivable due from Avnet and the percentage of worldwide net revenues from
Avnet are consistent with historical patterns. The Company monitors the
creditworthiness of its distributors and believes their sales to diverse end
customers and to diverse geographies further serve to mitigate the Company’s
exposure to credit risk.

Xilinx is subject to concentrations of
credit risk primarily in its trade accounts receivable and investments in debt
securities to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance
sheet. The Company attempts to mitigate the concentration of credit risk in its
trade receivables through its credit evaluation process, collection terms,
distributor sales to diverse end customers and through geographical dispersion
of sales. The Company has credit insurance for a portion of its accounts
receivable balance to further mitigate the concentration of its credit risk.
Xilinx generally does not require collateral for receivables from its end
customers or from distributors.

No end customer accounted for more than
10% of net revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007.

The Company mitigates concentrations of
credit risk in its investments in debt securities by currently investing
approximately 90% of its portfolio in AA or higher grade securities as rated by
Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s Investors Service. The Company’s methods to
arrive at investment decisions are not solely based on the rating agencies’
credit ratings. Xilinx also performs additional credit due diligence and
conducts regular portfolio credit reviews, including a review of counterparty
credit risk related to the Company’s forward currency exchange contracts.
Additionally, Xilinx limits its investments in the debt securities of a single
issuer based upon the issuer’s credit rating and attempts to further mitigate
credit risk by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer. As of
March 28, 2009, 37% and 63% of its investments in debt securities were domestic
and foreign issuers, respectively. See “Note 4. Financial Instruments” for
detailed information about the Company’s investment portfolio.

Since September 2007, the global credit
markets have experienced adverse conditions that have negatively impacted the
values of various types of investment and non-investment grade securities. The
global credit and capital markets have recently experienced further significant
volatility and disruption due to instability in the global financial system and
the current uncertainty related to global economic conditions. As of March 28,
2009, less than 7% of the Company’s $1.58 billion investment portfolio consisted
of asset-backed securities and approximately 11% of the portfolio consisted of
mortgage-backed securities. Asset-backed securities consisted of student loan
auction rate securities and other asset-backed securities.

Approximately 4% of the investment
portfolio consisted of student loan auction rate securities and all of these
securities are rated AAA with the exception of approximately 14% that were
downgraded to A rating during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. More than 98%
of the underlying assets that secure these securities are pools of student loans
originated under FFELP that are substantially guaranteed by the U.S. Department
of Education. These securities experienced failed auctions in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2008 due to liquidity issues in the global credit markets. In a failed
auction, the interest rates are reset to a maximum rate defined by the
contractual terms for each security. The Company has collected and expects to
collect all interest payable on these securities when due. During fiscal 2009,
$1.4 million of these student loan auction rate securities were redeemed for
cash by the issuers at par value. Because there can be no assurance of a
successful auction in the future, beginning with the quarter ended March 29,
2008, the student loan auction rate securities were reclassified from short-term
to long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets. The final maturity
dates range from March 2023 to November 2047.

All other asset-backed securities
comprised less than 3% of the investment portfolio as of March 28, 2009, of
which approximately 9% are AAA rated with the majority of the rest of the
asset-backed securities rated A or BBB. These asset-backed securities are
secured primarily by bank, finance and insurance company obligations,
collateralized loan and bank obligations, credit card debt and mortgage-backed
securities with no direct U.S. subprime mortgage exposure. Substantially all of
the other mortgage-backed securities in the portfolio are AAA rated, were issued
by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies and represented
approximately 11% of the investment portfolio as of March 28, 2009. As a result
of these recent adverse conditions in the global credit markets, there is a risk
that the Company may incur additional other-than-temporary impairment charges
for certain types of investments such as asset-backed securities should the
credit markets experience further deterioration or the underlying assets fail to
perform as anticipated due to the continued or worsening global economic
conditions. See “Note 4. Financial Instruments” for a table of the Company’s
available-for-sale securities.

Dependence on Independent
Manufacturers and Subcontractors

The Company does not directly
manufacture the finished silicon wafers used to manufacture its products. Xilinx
receives a substantial majority of its finished wafers from one independent
wafer manufacturer located in Taiwan. The Company is also dependent on a limited
number of subcontractors, primarily located in the Asia Pacific region, to
provide semiconductor assembly, test and shipment services.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies to other
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements; it does not
require any new fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157, as issued,
were effective for Xilinx on March 30, 2008. Additionally, in February 2008, the
FASB issued FSP No. 157-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB
Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value
Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement
13” (FSP 157-1) and FSP No. 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”
(FSP 157-2). FSP 157-1 removes leasing from the scope of SFAS 157. FSP 157-2
deferred the effective date of SFAS 157 from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 for all
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis (at least annually). Due to the deferral, the Company has delayed the
implementation of SFAS 157 provisions on the fair value of goodwill, other
intangible assets and nonfinancial long-lived assets. The Company adopted SFAS
157 on March 30, 2008, the first day of fiscal 2009, for all financial assets
and financial liabilities and for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on
a recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption of SFAS 157 is not expected
to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial condition and results
of operations when it is applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, beginning
in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. See “Note 3. Fair Value Measurements” for
additional information relating to the adoption of SFAS 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”
(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. The standard requires that
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
elected be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS 159 was
effective for Xilinx on March 30, 2008 and the Company has made no elections to
measure any financial instruments or certain other assets at fair
value.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141(R)) which replaces
SFAS No. 141. SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an
acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable
assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141(R) also establishes disclosure
requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the
business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective as of the beginning of an
entity's fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008 (fiscal 2010 for
Xilinx). The adoption of SFAS 141(R) will change the Company’s accounting
treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2010.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an
amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" (SFAS 160). The objective of
this statement is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of
the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated
financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary. SFAS 160 requires reclassifying noncontrolling interests, also
referred to as minority interests, as a component of equity upon adoption. SFAS
160 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's fiscal year that begins
after December 15, 2008 (fiscal 2010 for Xilinx). As of March 28, 2009, Xilinx
did not have any minority interests. The adoption of SFAS 160 will not have any
effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.
161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 amends and expands the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133), to provide an enhanced understanding of an
entity’s use of derivative instruments, how they are accounted for under SFAS
133 and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related
hedged items on the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash
flows. The Company adopted SFAS 161 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, which
began on December 28, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 161 had no financial impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The
disclosure requirements of SFAS 161 are presented in “Note 5. Derivative
Financial Instruments.”

In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No.
APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in
Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)” (FSP APB 14-1). The
Company’s 3.125% convertible debentures due March 15, 2037 will be affected by
this FSP. FSP APB 14-1 will require the issuer to separately account for the
liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the
issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in
subsequent periods. Further, the FSP will require bifurcation of a component of
the debt, classification of that component in equity, and then accretion of the
resulting discount on the debt as part of interest expense being reflected in
the statement of income. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2008 and will be required to be applied retrospectively to
all periods presented. The Company will be required to implement the standard
during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which began on March 29, 2009. Based on
the Company’s preliminary analysis, future net income per share will be impacted
upon adoption of the standard by a range of $0.01 per share to $0.07 per share,
with the impact on net income per share increasing within the
indicated


range each year through the debt’s
maturity. Adoption of the standard will also have a substantial impact in the
balance sheet reclassification for the equity component of the debt.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS
No. 157-4, “Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the
Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions
That Are Not Orderly” (FSP FAS 157-4). FSP FAS 157-4 amends SFAS 157 and
provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS
157 when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have
significantly decreased and also includes guidance on identifying circumstances
that indicate a transaction is not orderly for fair value measurements. This FSP
will be required to be applied prospectively to all fair value measurements
where appropriate and will be effective for interim and annual periods ending
after June 15, 2009. Xilinx will be required to implement the standard during
the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which began on March 29, 2009. The Company is
currently evaluating this new FSP but does not believe that its adoption will
have a significant impact on its consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS
115-2 and FAS 124-2, “Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments” (FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2). FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2
establishes a new model for measuring other-than-temporary impairments for debt
securities, including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write-down
through earnings versus other comprehensive income. This FSP will replace the
existing requirement that the entity’s management assert it has both the intent
and ability to hold an impaired debt security until recovery with a requirement
that management assert it does not have the intent to sell the security, and it
is more likely than not it will not have to sell the security before recovery of
its carrying value. FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 will be effective for interim
and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. Xilinx will be required to
implement the standard during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which began on
March 29, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating this new FSP but does not
believe that its adoption will have a significant impact on its consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS
107-1 and APB 28-1, “Interim Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments” (FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1). FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 amends
SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” (SFAS
107) to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments not
measured on the balance sheet at fair value in interim financial statements as
well as in annual financial statements. Prior to this FSP, fair values for these
assets and liabilities were only disclosed annually. This FSP applies to all
financial instruments within the scope of SFAS 107 and requires all entities to
disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair
value of financial instruments. This FSP will be effective for interim periods
ending after June 15, 2009. FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 will result in increased
disclosures in the Company’s interim periods beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal 2010, which began on March 29, 2009.

Note 3. Fair Value
Measurements

Effective March 30, 2008, the Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 for all financial assets and financial
liabilities and for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis (at least annually). SFAS 157 defines fair value as the exchange price
that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an
exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and
liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company
considers the principal or most advantageous market in which Xilinx would
transact and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when
pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and
risk of nonperformance.

Fair Value Hierarchy

SFAS 157 establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy
requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The fair value framework
requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based
upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. SFAS 157
requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and
disclosed in one of the following categories:

Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

The Company’s Level 1 assets consist of
U.S. Treasury securities and money market funds.

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than
quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable
or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term
of the asset or liability.

The Company’s Level 2 assets consist of
bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, municipal
bonds, U.S. agency securities, foreign government and agency securities,
floating-rate notes, certain asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed
securities. The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities include foreign
currency forward contracts.


Level 3 - Unobservable inputs to the
valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and
that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or
liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value
measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management
judgment or estimation.

The Company’s Level 3 assets and
liabilities include student loan auction rate securities, certain asset-backed
securities and the embedded derivative related to the Company’s convertible
debentures.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

In instances where the inputs used to
measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the
fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s
assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value
measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of
inputs specific to the asset or liability. The following table presents
information about the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring basis as of March 28, 2009:

As of March 28, 2009, marketable
securities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs were comprised of $58.4
million of student loan auction rate securities and $36.5 million of
asset-backed securities within the Company’s available-for-sale investment
portfolio. Auction failures during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and the
lack of market activity and liquidity required that the Company’s student loan
auction rate securities be measured using observable market data and Level 3
inputs. The fair values of the Company’s student loan auction rate securities
were based on the Company’s assessment of the underlying collateral and the
creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities. More than 98% of the
underlying assets that secure the student loan auction rate securities are pools
of student loans originated under FFELP that are substantially guaranteed by the
U.S. Department of Education. The fair values of the Company’s student loan
auction rate securities were determined using a discounted cash flow pricing
model that incorporated financial inputs such as projected cash flows, discount
rates, expected interest rates to be paid to investors and an estimated
liquidity discount. The weighted-average life over which cash flows were
projected was determined to be approximately nine years, given the collateral
composition of the securities. The discount rates that were applied to the
pricing model were based on market data and information for comparable- or
similar-term student loan asset-backed securities. The discount rates increased
by approximately 215 to 300 basis points (2.15 and 3.00 percentage points) in
fiscal 2009 due to a widening of credit spreads and increased liquidity discount
as a result of the global credit crisis. The expected interest rate to be paid
to investors in a failed auction was determined by the contractual terms for
each security. The liquidity discount represents an estimate of the additional
return an investor would require to compensate for the lack of liquidity of the
student loan auction rate securities. The Company has the ability and intent to
hold the student loan auction rate securities until anticipated recovery, which
could be at final maturity that ranges from March 2023 to November 2047. Because
there can be no assurance of a successful auction in the future, all of the
Company’s student loan auction rate securities are recorded in long-term
investments on its condensed consolidated balance sheets. All of the Company’s
student loan auction rate securities are rated AAA with the exception of $8.1
million that were downgraded to A rating during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2009.

The Company’s $36.5 million of senior
class asset-backed securities are secured primarily by bank, finance and
insurance company obligations, collateralized loan and bank obligations, credit
card debt and mortgage-backed securities with no direct U.S. subprime mortgage
exposure. The $36.5 million of senior class asset-backed securities were
measured using observable market data and Level 3 inputs due to the lack of
market activity and liquidity. The fair values of these senior class
asset-backed securities were based on the Company’s assessment of the underlying
collateral and the creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities. The
Company determined the fair values for the $36.5 million of senior class
asset-backed securities by using prices from pricing services that could not be
corroborated by observable market data. The Company corroborated the prices from
the pricing services using comparable benchmark indexes and securities prices.
The Company has the ability and intent to hold the $36.5 million of senior class
asset-backed securities until final maturity in November 2009. The $36.5 million
of senior class asset-backed securities were downgraded by at least one credit
rating agency during the past two fiscal quarters and are currently rated or
split rated between AAA and BBB rating.

Senior class asset-backed securities
were partially written off in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 due to default
by the issuer in October 2008. At the time of the initial write-off of $19.8
million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company understood, based on
the issuer’s prospectus disclosures that investors would be repaid
proportionally and without

preference. In October 2008, the issuer went into
receivership. The receiver subsequently sought judicial interpretation of a
provision of a legal document governing the issuer’s securities. As a result of
the outcome of the judicial determination, the receiver immediately liquidated
the substantial majority of the issuer’s assets, and in accordance with the
court order, the proceeds were used to repay short-term liabilities in the order
in which they fell due. In December 2008, the receiver reported to the issuer’s
creditors the outcome of the judicial determination and that the issuer’s
liabilities substantially exceeded its assets. As a result, the receiver
estimated that the issuer would not be able to pay any liabilities falling due
after October 2008 regardless of the seniority or status of the securities. The
Company’s investments in these senior class asset-backed securities mature in
September 2009 and September 2010. Based on these new developments, the Company
concluded that it is not likely to recover the remaining balance of its
investment. Accordingly, during the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company
recognized an impairment loss of $18.2 million, which represented the carrying
balance of the senior class asset-backed securities. The original purchase price
of these securities, excluding accrued interest, was $38.0 million. For fiscal
2009, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $38.0 million on these senior
class asset-backed securities. See “Note 9. Impairment Loss on Investments” for
additional information regarding impairment losses on investments.

In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00
billion principal amount of 3.125% junior subordinated convertible debentures to
an initial purchaser in a private offering. As a result of the repurchases in
fiscal 2009, the remaining carrying value of the debentures on the consolidated
balance sheet as of March 28, 2009, was $690.1 million. The fair value of the
debentures as of March 28, 2009 was approximately $508.6 million, based on the
last trading price of the debentures. The debentures included embedded features
which qualify as an embedded derivative under SFAS 133. The embedded derivative
was separately accounted for as a discount on the debentures and its fair value
was established at the inception of the debentures. Each quarter, the change in
the fair value of the


embedded derivative, if any, is
recorded in the consolidated statements of income. The Company uses a derivative
valuation model to derive the value of the embedded derivative. Key inputs into
this valuation model are the Company’s current stock price, risk-free interest
rates, the stock dividend yield, the stock volatility and the debenture’s credit
spread over LIBOR. The first three inputs are based on observable market data
while the last two inputs require management judgment and are Level 3
inputs.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring
Basis

The Company’s investments in
non-marketable securities of private companies are accounted for by using the
cost method. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring
basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In determining
whether a decline in value of non-marketable equity investments in private
companies has occurred and is other than temporary, an assessment is made by
considering available evidence, including the general market conditions in the
investee’s industry, the investee’s product development status and subsequent
rounds of financing and the related valuation and/or Xilinx’s participation in
such financings. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to meet
business milestones and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the
individual investee, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash
and the investee’s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation.
The valuation methodology for determining the decline in value of non-marketable
equity securities is based on the factors noted above which require management
judgment and are Level 3 inputs. The Company recognized impairment losses on
non-marketable equity investments of $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.0 million
during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The entire amount of each of
the impaired non-marketable equity investments was written off.

The gross unrealized losses on these
investments were primarily due to adverse conditions in the global credit
markets in fiscal 2009 and 2008. The Company reviewed the investment portfolio
and determined that the gross unrealized losses on these investments as of March
28, 2009 and March 29, 2008 were temporary in nature. The aggregate of
individual unrealized losses that had been outstanding for 12 months or more
were not significant as of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008. The Company has
the ability and intent to hold these investments until recovery of their
carrying values. The Company also believes that it will be able to collect both
principal and interest amounts due to the Company at maturity, given the high
credit quality of these investments and any related underlying collateral.

The amortized cost and estimated fair
value of marketable debt securities (bank certificates of deposit, commercial
paper, corporate bonds, auction rate securities, municipal bonds, U.S. and
foreign government and agency securities, floating rate notes, asset-backed
securities and mortgage-backed securities) as of March 28, 2009, by contractual
maturity, are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations
without call or prepayment penalties.

Note 5. Derivative Financial
Instruments

Effective December 28, 2008, the
Company adopted SFAS 161, as discussed in “Note 2. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

and Concentrations of Risk.”

As of March 28, 2009 and March 29,
2008, the Company had the following outstanding forward currency exchange
contracts which are derivative financial instruments:

Effective beginning in the first
quarter of fiscal 2009, as part of the Company’s strategy to reduce volatility
of operating expenses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the Company
expanded its hedging program from a one-quarter forward outlook to a
five-quarter forward outlook for major foreign-currency-denominated operating
expenses. The contracts expire at various dates between April 2009 and April
2010. The net unrealized gain or loss, which approximates the fair market value
of the above contracts, was immaterial as of March 28, 2009 and March 29,
2008.

As of March 28, 2009, all the forward
foreign currency exchange contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow
hedges and the effective portion of the gain or loss on the forward contract is
reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into net
income in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

The Company may enter into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments such as the
acquisition of capital expenditures. For such forward foreign currency exchange
contracts that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or
loss on the forward contract as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the same line item
associated with the hedged item in current earnings.

The 3.125% debentures include
provisions which qualify as an embedded derivative. See “Note 14. Convertible
Debentures

and Revolving Credit Facility” for detailed discussion about the embedded
derivative. The embedded derivative was separated from the debentures and its
fair value was established at the inception of the debentures. Any subsequent
change in fair value of the embedded derivative would be recorded in the
Company’s consolidated statement of income. The fair value of the embedded
derivative at inception of the debentures was $2.5 million and it changed to
$2.3 million and $2.1 million as of March 29, 2008 and March 28, 2009,
respectively. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivative of $170
thousand during fiscal 2008 was recorded as a charge to interest and other
income, net on the Company’s consolidated statement of income. The change in the
fair value of the embedded derivative of $170 thousand during fiscal 2009 was
recorded as a credit to interest and other income, net on the Company’s
consolidated statement of income.


The Company has the following
derivative instruments as of March 28, 2009, located on the consolidated balance
sheet, utilized for risk management purposes detailed above:

Note 6. Stock-Based Compensation
Plans

The Company’s equity incentive plans
are broad-based, long-term retention programs that are intended to attract and
retain talented employees as well as align stockholder and employee
interests.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Effective April 2, 2006, the Company
adopted SFAS 123(R), as discussed in “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

and Concentrations of Risk.” The following table summarizes stock-based
compensation expense related to stock awards granted under the Company’s equity
incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under the Company’s Employee

In June 2006, stockholder derivative
complaints were filed against the Company concerning the Company’s historical
option-granting practices and the SEC initiated an informal inquiry on the
matter. An investigation of the Company’s historical stock option-granting
practices was conducted by outside counsel and no evidence of fraud, management
misconduct or manipulation in the timing or exercise price of stock option
grants was found. The investigation determined that in nearly all cases, stock
options were issued as of pre-set dates; however, there were some minor
differences between the recorded grant dates and measurement dates for certain
grants made between 1997 and 2006. As a result, a $2.2 million charge was taken
to the Company’s earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Subsequently the
SEC informal inquiry was terminated and no enforcement action was recommended
and the stockholder derivative complaints were dismissed.

In accordance with SFAS 123(R), the
Company adjusts stock-based compensation on a quarterly basis for changes to the
estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on actual forfeiture
experience. The effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense


amortization after April 1, 2006 is
recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. The effect of
forfeiture adjustments in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
insignificant.

The amount that the Company would have
capitalized to inventory as of April 1, 2006, if it had applied the provisions
of SFAS 123(R) retrospectively, was $4.5 million. Under the provisions of SFAS
123(R), this $4.5 million was recorded as a credit to additional
paid-in-capital. The total stock-based compensation released from the inventory
capitalization during fiscal 2009 and 2008 was $396 thousand and $675 thousand,
respectively, which resulted in an ending inventory balance of $1.1 million and
$1.5 million related to stock-based compensation as of March 28, 2009 and March
29, 2008, respectively. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, the tax benefit
realized for the tax deduction from option exercises and other awards, including
amounts credited to additional paid-in capital, totaled $11.4 million, $25.3
million and $35.8 million, respectively.

The fair values of stock options and
stock purchase plan rights under the Company’s equity incentive plans and
Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated as of the grant date using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company’s expected stock price
volatility assumption for stock options is estimated using implied volatility of
the Company’s traded options. The expected life of options granted is based on
the historical exercise activity as well as the expected disposition of all
options outstanding. The expected life of options granted also considers the
contractual term which decreased to seven years beginning in the first quarter
of fiscal 2008, thereby decreasing the expected life by nearly one year. The
per-share weighted-average fair values of stock options granted during fiscal
2009, 2008 and 2007 were $7.28, $7.23 and $9.02, respectively. The per share
weighted-average fair values of stock purchase rights granted under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $6.45, $7.20 and
$6.51, respectively. The fair values of stock options and stock purchase plan
rights granted in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were estimated at the date of grant
using the following weighted-average assumptions:

The Company began granting restricted
stock units (RSUs) in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The estimated fair
values of RSU awards were calculated based on the market price of Xilinx common
stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected
to be paid on Xilinx common stock prior to vesting. The per share
weighted-average fair values of RSUs granted during fiscal 2009 and 2008 were
$21.89 and $24.46, respectively. The weighted-average fair values of RSUs
granted in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were calculated based on estimates at the date
of grant as follows:



Risk-free interest rate

1.1% to 3.2%

      closing price per share of Xilinx’s stock on March 27, 2009, for all
      in-the-money options outstanding.

Options outstanding that are expected
to vest are net of estimated future option forfeitures in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 123(R), which are estimated when compensation costs are
recognized. Options with a fair value of $43.5 million completed vesting during
fiscal 2009. As of March 28, 2009, total unrecognized stock-based compensation
costs related to stock options and Employee


Stock Purchase Plan was $40.2 million
and $25.0 million, respectively. The total unrecognized stock-based compensation
cost for stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years and 1.2 years,
respectively.

Employee
Stock Option Plans

Under the Company’s stock option plans
(Option Plans), options reserved for future issuance of common shares to
employees and directors of the Company total 52.1 million shares as of March 28,
2009, including 11.1 million shares available for future grants under the 2007
Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Equity Plan). Options to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock under the Option Plans are granted at 100% of the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant. The contractual term for stock
awards granted under the 2007 Equity Plan is seven years from the grant date.
Prior to April 1, 2007, stock options granted by the Company generally expired
ten years from the grant date. Stock awards granted to existing and newly hired
employees generally vest over a four-year period from the date of grant.

In July 2006, the stockholders approved
the adoption of the 2007 Equity Plan and authorized 10.0 million shares to be
reserved for issuance thereunder. On August 9, 2007 and August 14, 2008, the
stockholders approved amendments to increase the authorized number of shares
reserved for issuance under the 2007 Equity Plan by 5.0 million shares and 4.0
million shares, respectively. The types of awards allowed under the 2007 Equity
Plan include incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, RSUs,
restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. To date, the Company has issued
a mix of non-qualified stock options and RSUs under the 2007 Equity Plan. The
mix of stock options and RSU awards will change depending upon the grade level
of the employees. Employees at the lower grade levels will receive mostly RSUs
and may also receive stock options, whereas employees at the higher grade
levels, including the Company’s executive officers, will receive mostly stock
options and may also receive RSUs. The 2007 Equity Plan,


which became effective on January 1,
2007, replaced both the Company’s 1997 Stock Plan (which expired on May 8, 2007)
and the Supplemental Stock Option Plan and all available but unissued shares
under these prior plans were cancelled as of April 1, 2007. The 2007 Equity Plan
is now Xilinx’s only plan for providing stock-based awards to eligible employees
and non-employee directors. At its 2009 annual stockholder meeting, the Company
will seek stockholder approval of an increase in the number of shares reserved
for issuance under the 2007 Equity Plan by 5.0 million shares.

The total pre-tax intrinsic value of
options exercised during fiscal 2009 and 2008 was $18.1 million and $65.8
million, respectively. This intrinsic value represents the difference between
the exercise price and the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on
the date of exercise.

Since the Company adopted the policy of
retiring all repurchased shares of its common stock, new shares are issued upon
employees’ exercise of their stock options.

Employee
Qualified Stock Purchase Plan

Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
qualified employees can obtain a 24-month purchase right to purchase the
Company’s common stock at the end of each six-month exercise period.
Participation is limited to 15% of the employee’s annual earnings up to a
maximum of $21 thousand in a calendar year. Approximately 77% of all eligible
employees participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The purchase price of
the stock is 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of the
24-month offering period or at the end of each six-month exercise period.
Employees purchased 2.2 million shares for $34.5 million in fiscal 2009, 2.1
million shares for $36.6 million in fiscal 2008 and 2.0 million shares for $34.2
million in fiscal 2007. On August 14, 2008, the stockholders approved an
amendment to increase the authorized number of shares reserved for issuance
under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan by 2.0 million shares. As of March 28,
2009, 7.6 million shares were available for future issuance out of 40.5 million
shares authorized. At its 2009 annual stockholder meeting, the Company will seek
stockholder approval of an increase in the number of shares reserved for
issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan by 2.0 million shares.

Note 8. Restructuring Charges

In June 2008, Xilinx announced a
functional reorganization pursuant to which Xilinx eliminated 249 positions, or
approximately 7% of the Company’s global workforce. These employee terminations
occurred across various geographies and functions worldwide. The reorganization
plan was completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

The Company recorded total
restructuring charges of $22.0 million in connection with the reorganization.
These charges consisted of $19.5 million of severance pay and benefits expenses
which were recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and $2.5 million of
facility-related costs and severance benefits expenses which were recorded in
the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

facilities expiring at various dates through December 2012.

See “Note 21. Subsequent Events” for
information relating to a restructuring announced on April 15, 2009.

Note 9. Impairment Loss on
Investments

The Company recognized impairment
losses on investments of $54.1 million, $2.9 million and $2.0 million during
fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

During fiscal 2009, the Company
recorded total impairment losses related to senior class asset-backed securities
of $38.0 million, which represented the original purchase price of these
securities, excluding accrued interest. As discussed in “Note 3. Fair Value
Measurements,” the senior class asset-backed securities were partially written
off in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 due to default by the issuer in October
2008. At the time of the initial write-off of $19.8 million in the second
quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company understood, based on the issuer’s prospectus
disclosures that investors would be repaid proportionally and without
preference. In October 2008, the issuer went into receivership. The receiver
subsequently sought judicial interpretation of a provision of a legal document
governing the issuer’s securities. As a result of the outcome of the judicial
determination, the receiver immediately liquidated the substantial majority of
the issuer’s assets, and in accordance with the court order, the proceeds were
used to repay short-term liabilities in the order in which they fell due. In
December 2008, the receiver reported to the issuer’s creditors the outcome of
the judicial determination and that the issuer’s liabilities substantially
exceeded its assets. As a result, the receiver estimated that the issuer would
not be able to pay any liabilities falling due after October 2008 regardless of
the seniority or status of the securities. The Company’s investments in these
senior class asset-backed securities mature in September 2009 and September
2010. Based on these new developments, the Company concluded that it is not
likely to recover the remaining balance of its investment. This decline in fair
value was deemed to be other than temporary and, therefore, the Company
recognized a total impairment loss on this investment. Accordingly, during the
third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $18.2
million, which represented the carrying balance of the senior class asset-backed
securities.

During the second quarter of fiscal
2009, the issuer of one of the marketable debt securities in the Company’s
investment portfolio filed for bankruptcy resulting in a significant decline in
the fair value of this security. The original purchase price of this security,
excluding accrued interest, was $10.0 million. Based upon the available market
and financial data for the issuer, the decline in market value was deemed to be
other than temporary and the Company recorded impairment losses of $9.0 million,
including $8.4 million in the second quarter and $600 thousand in the third
quarter of fiscal 2009.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009,
the Company recognized an additional impairment loss of $1.0 million on
marketable debt securities in the Company’s investment portfolio.

During fiscal 2009, the Company
recognized a $3.1 million impairment loss as a result of a continuous decline
that began in fiscal 2008 in the market value of the Company’s investment in a
marketable equity security. The Company believed that the decline in the market
value was other than temporary and it was deemed to be worthless as of September
27, 2008. The Company recognized an impairment loss on its investment in this
marketable equity security during the first and second quarters of fiscal
2009.

The Company recorded impairment losses
of $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.0 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, related to the Company’s investment in non-marketable equity
securities in private companies. These impairment losses resulted primarily from
weak financial conditions of certain investees, certain investees diluting
Xilinx’s investment through the receipt of additional rounds of investment at a
lower valuation or from the liquidation of certain investees.

Note 10. Commitments

Xilinx leases some of its facilities
and office buildings under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at
various dates through October 2017. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006,
Xilinx entered into a land lease in conjunction with the Company’s new


building investment in Singapore. The
land lease will expire in November 2035 and the lease cost was settled in an
up-front payment in June 2006. Some of the operating leases for facilities and
office buildings require payment of operating costs, including property taxes,
repairs, maintenance and insurance. Most of the Company’s leases contain renewal
options for varying terms. Approximate future minimum lease payments under
non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:

Aggregate future rental income to be
received, which includes rents from both owned and leased property, totaled $4.5
million as of March 28, 2009. Rent expense, net of rental income, under all
operating leases was $9.2 million for fiscal 2009, $8.2 million for fiscal 2008
and $8.7 million for fiscal 2007. Rental income, which includes rents received
from both owned and leased property, was not material for fiscal 2009, 2008 or
2007.

Other commitments as of March 28, 2009
totaled $46.5 million and consisted of purchases of inventory and other
non-cancelable purchase obligations related to subcontractors that manufacture
silicon wafers and provide assembly and some test services. The Company expects
to receive and pay for these materials and services in the next three to six
months, as the products meet delivery and quality specifications. As of March
28, 2009, the Company also had $19.7 million of non-cancelable license
obligations to providers of electronic design automation software and
hardware/software maintenance expiring at various dates through September 2011.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005,
the Company committed up to $20.0 million to acquire, in the future, rights to
intellectual property until July 2023. This commitment was reduced to $5.0
million in May 2009. License payments will be amortized over the useful life of
the intellectual property acquired.

Note 11. Net Income Per Common Share

The computation of basic net income per
common share for all periods presented is derived from the information on the
consolidated statements of income, and there are no reconciling items in the
numerator used to compute diluted net income per common share. The total shares
used in the denominator of the diluted net income per common share calculation
includes 741 thousand, 3.6 million and 5.7 million potentially dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, that
are not included in basic net income per common share. Potentially dilutive
common equivalent shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to
the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of
outstanding RSUs and the assumed issuance of common stock under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan.

Outstanding stock options and RSUs to
purchase approximately 44.1 million, 39.9 million and 40.7 million shares, for
fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, under the Company's stock award plans
were excluded from diluted net income per common share, applying the treasury
stock method, as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. These options and
RSUs could be dilutive in the future if the Company’s average share price
increases and is greater than the combined exercise prices and the unamortized
fair values of these options and RSUs.

Diluted net income per common share
does not include any incremental shares issuable upon the exchange of the
debentures (see “Note 14. Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit
Facility”). The debentures will have no impact on diluted net income per common
share until the price of the Company’s common stock exceeds the conversion price
of $30.82 per share, because the principal amount of the debentures will be
settled in cash upon conversion. Prior to conversion, the Company will include,
in the diluted net income per common share calculation, the effect of the
additional shares that may be issued when the Company’s common stock price
exceeds $30.82 per share, using the treasury stock method. The conversion price
of $30.82 per share represents the adjusted conversion price due to the
accumulation of cash dividends distributed to the common stockholders through
the third quarter of fiscal 2009.

Note 14. Convertible Debentures and
Revolving Credit Facility

3.125%
Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures

In March 2007, the Company issued $1.00
billion principal amount of 3.125% junior convertible debentures due March 15,
2037, to an initial purchaser in a private offering. The debentures are
subordinated in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future senior
debt and to the other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. The debentures
were initially convertible, subject to certain conditions, into shares of Xilinx
common stock at a conversion rate of 32.0760 shares of common stock per $1
thousand principal amount of debentures, representing an initial effective
conversion price of approximately $31.18 per share of common stock. The
conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events as outlined in the
indenture governing the debentures but will not be adjusted for accrued
interest. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, due to the accumulation of
cash dividend distributions to common stockholders, the conversion rate for the
debentures was adjusted to 32.4446 shares of common stock per $1 thousand
principal amount of debentures, representing an adjusted conversion price of
$30.82 per share.

The Company received net proceeds from
issuance of the debentures of $980.0 million after deduction of issuance costs
of $20.0 million. The debt issuance costs are recorded in long-term other assets
and are being amortized to interest expense over 30 years. Interest is payable
semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15, beginning on September 15,
2007. Interest expense related to the debentures for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007
totaled $28.9 million, $32.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively, and was
included in interest and other income, net on the consolidated statements of
income. The debentures also have a contingent interest component that may
require the Company to pay interest based on certain thresholds beginning with
the semi-annual interest period commencing


on March 15, 2014 (the maximum amount
of contingent interest that will accrue is 0.50% per year) and upon the
occurrence of certain events, as outlined in the indenture governing the
debentures.

In the third and fourth quarters of
fiscal 2009, the Company paid $193.2 million in cash to repurchase $310.4
million (principal amount) of its debentures and recognized a gain on early
extinguishment of convertible debentures of $110.6 million, net of the write-off
of the pro rata portions of unamortized debt issuance costs ($5.8 million) and
unamortized derivative valuation ($736 thousand). Accrued interest paid at the
time of repurchases totaled $2.4 million.

On or after March 15, 2014, the Company
may redeem all or part of the remaining debentures outstanding for the principal
amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest if the closing price of the
Company’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in
effect for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading-day period
prior to the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. Upon
conversion, the Company would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable
number of shares of Xilinx common stock, up to the principal amount of the
debentures. If the conversion value exceeds $1 thousand, the Company may also
deliver, at its option, cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common
stock for the conversion value in excess of $1 thousand (conversion spread).
There would be no adjustment to the numerator in the net income per common share
computation for the cash settled portion of the debentures as that portion of
the debt instrument will always be settled in cash. The conversion spread will
be included in the denominator for the computation of diluted net income per
common share.

Holders of the debentures may convert
their debentures only upon the occurrence of certain events in the future, as
outlined in the indenture. In addition, holders of the debentures who convert
their debentures in connection with a fundamental change, as defined in the
indenture, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in
the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, the
holders of the debentures may require Xilinx to purchase all or a portion of
their debentures at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. As of March 28, 2009, none
of the conditions allowing holders of the debentures to convert had been met.

The Company concluded that the embedded
features related to the contingent interest payments and the Company making
specific types of distributions (e.g., extraordinary dividends) qualify as
derivatives and should be bundled as a compound embedded derivative under SFAS
133. The fair value of the derivative at the date of issuance of the debentures
was $2.5 million and is accounted for as a discount on the debentures. The
initial fair value of the debentures of $997.5 million will be accreted to par
value over the term of the debt resulting in $2.5 million being amortized to
interest expense over 30 years. Due to the repurchase of a portion of the
debentures in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 as noted above, the
carrying value of the derivative ($1.6 million) will continue to be amortized to
interest expense over the remaining term of the debentures. Any change in fair
value of this embedded derivative will be included in interest and other income,
net on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The fair value of the
derivative as of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008 was $2.1 million and $2.3
million, respectively. The balance of the debentures on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets as of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008 was $690.1
million and $999.9 million, respectively, including the fair value of the
embedded derivative. The Company also concluded that the debentures are not
conventional convertible debt instruments and that the embedded stock conversion
option qualifies as a derivative under SFAS 133. In addition, in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-19 of the FASB, “Accounting for
Derivative Financial Instruments indexed to and Potentially Settled in a
Company’s own Stock,” the Company has concluded that the embedded conversion
option would be classified in stockholders’ equity if it were a freestanding
instrument. Accordingly, the embedded conversion option is not required to be
accounted for separately as a derivative.

Under the terms of the debentures, the
Company was required to file a shelf registration statement covering resales of
the debentures and any common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures
with the SEC and cause the shelf registration statement to be declared effective
within 180 days of the closing of the offering of the debentures. In addition,
the Company was required to maintain the effectiveness of the shelf registration
statement for a period of two years after the closing of the offering of the
debentures or until the securities can be traded without registration. If the
Company failed to meet these terms, it would have been required to pay
additional interest on the debentures at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% for the
first 90 days after the occurrence of the event and 0.50% after the first 90
days. The Company filed the shelf registration statement with the SEC in June
2007 and fulfilled its registration obligations and is no longer subject to
contingent interest liability related to registration requirements.

Revolving
Credit Facility

In April 2007, Xilinx entered into a
five-year $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of banks. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a
benchmark rate plus an applicable margin based upon the Company’s credit rating.
In connection with the credit facility, the Company is required to maintain
certain financial and nonfinancial covenants. As of March 28, 2009, the Company
had made no borrowings under this credit facility and was not in violation of
any of the covenants.


Note 15. Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred
Stock

The Company’s Certificate of
Incorporation authorized 2.0 million shares of undesignated preferred stock. The
preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. The Board of Directors is
authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of preferred
stock. As of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008, no preferred shares were issued
or outstanding.

Common Stock and Debentures Repurchase Programs

The Board of Directors has approved
stock repurchase programs enabling the Company to repurchase its common stock in
the open market or through negotiated transactions with independent financial
institutions. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company completed
its $1.50 billion repurchase program announced in February 2007 by repurchasing
1.7 million shares for $43.9 million. On February 25, 2008, the Board authorized
the repurchase of up to an additional $800.0 million of common stock. On
November 6, 2008, the Board of Directors approved the amendment of the Company’s
$800.0 million stock repurchase program to provide that the funds may also be
used to repurchase outstanding debentures. This repurchase program has no stated
expiration date. Through March 28, 2009, the Company had used $274.3 million of
the $800.0 million authorized for the repurchase of its outstanding common stock
and debentures. The Company’s current policy is to retire all repurchased shares
and debentures, and consequently, no treasury shares or debentures were held as
of March 28, 2009 or March 29, 2008.

During the first six months of fiscal
2009 and the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2008, the Company
entered into stock repurchase agreements with independent financial
institutions. Under these agreements, Xilinx provided these financial
institutions with up-front payments totaling $275.0 million for fiscal 2009 and
$550.0 million for fiscal 2008. These financial institutions agreed to deliver
to Xilinx a certain number of shares based upon the volume weighted-average
price, during an averaging period, less a specified discount. As of March 28,
2009 and March 29, 2008, no amounts remained outstanding under any stock
repurchase agreements and all related shares had been delivered to the Company.

During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
Company repurchased a total of 10.8 million, 23.5 million and 55.2 million
shares of common stock for $275.0 million, $550.0 million and $1.43 billion,
respectively. The Company paid $193.2 million in cash to repurchase $310.4
million (principal amount) of its debentures during fiscal 2009. See “Note 14.
Convertible Debentures and Revolving Credit Facility” for additional information
about the debentures.

paid-in capital were $4.2 million, $15.8 million and $35.8 million, for fiscal
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.


As of March 28, 2009, the Company had
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $18.8
million. If unused, these carryforwards will expire in 2013 through 2026. The
Company had federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$103.9 million, federal affordable housing tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $15.3 million and no other state credit carryforwards. If unused,
$28.5 million of the tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2023 through 2029.
The remainder of the credits have no expiration date.

Unremitted foreign earnings that are
considered to be permanently invested outside the United States and on which no
U.S. taxes have been provided, are approximately $712.2 million as of March 28,
2009. The residual U.S. tax liability, if such amounts were remitted, would be
approximately $219.7 million.

The Company has manufacturing
operations in Ireland and Singapore. In Ireland, the Company operates under a
special tax regime granted for manufacturing status. Under this regime, the
majority of the income earned in Ireland is subject to tax at 10%. The regime
granting manufacturing status is effective through fiscal 2010. The tax benefit
from this special status for fiscal 2009 is approximately $1.2 million on income
considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The Company has been granted
“Pioneer Status” in Singapore that is effective through fiscal 2021. The Pioneer
Status reduces the Company’s tax on the majority of Singapore income from 20% to
zero. The benefit of Pioneer Status in Singapore for fiscal 2009 is
approximately $15.6 million ($0.06 per common share) on income considered
permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The tax effect of these low tax
jurisdictions on the Company’s overall tax rate is reflected in the table
above.

Long-term deferred tax assets of $77.4
million and $66.1 million as of March 28, 2009 and March 29, 2008, respectively,
are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet (see “Note 7.
Balance Sheet Information”).

The Company adopted FIN 48 on April 1,
2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income
tax law. This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial
statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.

The aggregate changes in the balance of
gross unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were as follows (in

The Company adjusted the cumulative
effect of adopting FIN 48 in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 in connection
with a change in estimate related to the application of certain historical tax
elections. As a result, retained earnings and deferred tax liabilities decreased
by $10.1 million and $18.2 million, respectively, and long-term income taxes
payable increased by $28.3 million.

If the remaining balance of $115.6
million and $105.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of March 28, 2009 and
March 29, 2008, respectively, were realized in a future period, it would result
in a tax benefit of $58.5 million and $44.7 million, respectively, thereby
reducing the effective tax rate.

The Company’s policy to include
interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within the provision
for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income did not change as a
result of implementing the provisions of FIN 48. The balance of accrued interest
and penalties was $4.0 million and $2.9 million as of March 28, 2009 and March
29, 2008, respectively. Interest and penalties included in the Company’s
provision for income taxes totaled $1.1 million and $1.4 million for fiscal 2009
and 2008, respectively.

With limited exception, the Company is
no longer subject to U.S. federal and state audits by taxing authorities for
years through fiscal 2004. The Company is no longer subject to tax audits in
Ireland for years through fiscal 2003.

On December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a
statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal
2005. The Company filed a petition with the Tax Court on March 2, 2009, in
response to this notice of deficiency

and

plans to contest the proposed
adjustments. The Company believes it has provided adequate reserves for any tax
deficiencies that could result from this IRS action. Due to this and various
other factors, the Company believes it is impractical to determine the amount of
uncertain tax benefits that will significantly increase or decrease within the
next 12 months.

The IRS examined the Company’s tax
returns for fiscal 1996 through 2001.  All issues have been settled with
the exception of issues related to the cost sharing of stock options.  On
August 30, 2005, the Tax Court issued its opinion concerning whether the value
of stock options must be included in the cost sharing agreement with Xilinx
Ireland.  The Tax Court agreed with the Company that no amount for stock
options was to be included in the cost sharing agreement, and thus, the Company
had no tax, interest or penalties due for this issue.  The Tax Court
entered its decision on May 31, 2006.  On August 25, 2006, the IRS appealed
the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  On May
27, 2009, the Company received a 2-1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals
Court reversing the Tax Court decision and holding that the Company should
include stock option amounts in its cost sharing agreement with Xilinx
Ireland.  The Company expects to record expense of $8.6 million in the
first quarter of fiscal 2010 in order to reverse the interest income it accrued
through March 28, 2009 on the earlier prepayment it made to the IRS.  The
Company is presently determining the amount of penalties and interest to be
accrued under FIN 48 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of the
Appeals Court decision.

Note 17. Segment Information

Xilinx designs, develops, and markets
programmable logic semiconductor devices and the related software design tools.

Note 18. Litigation Settlements and
Contingencies

Internal Revenue Service

On August 25, 2006, the IRS filed a
Notice of Appeal that it appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, the August 30, 2005 decision of the Tax Court. In its 2005 decision,
the Tax Court decided in favor of the Company and rejected the IRS’s position
that the value of compensatory stock options must be included in the Company’s
cost sharing agreement with its Irish affiliate.  On May 27, 2009, the
Company received a 2-1 adverse judicial ruling from the Appeals Court reversing
the Tax Court decision and holding that the Company should include stock option
amounts in its cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland.  The Company
does not agree with the Appeals Court decision and is reviewing its alternatives
as a result of the decision.  The Company expects to record expense of $8.6
million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 in order to reverse the interest
income it accrued through March 28, 2009 on the earlier prepayment it made to
the IRS.  The Company is presently determining the amount of penalties and
interest to be accrued under FIN 48 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 as a
result of this decision (see “Note 16. Income Taxes” and “Note 21. Subsequent
Events”).

In a separate matter, on December 8, 2008, the IRS issued a
statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal
2005. The Company filed a petition with the Tax Court on March 2, 2009, in
response to this notice of deficiency

and

plans to contest the proposed adjustments.
The Company believes that adequate accruals have been provided for fiscal 2005
and all other open tax years.

Patent Litigation

On December 28, 2007, a patent
infringement lawsuit was filed by PACT XPP Technologies, AG (PACT) against the
Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall
Division (PACT XPP Technologies, AG. v. Xilinx, Inc. and Avnet, Inc. Case No.
2:07-CV-563). The lawsuit pertains to 11 different patents and PACT seeks
injunctive relief, unspecified damages and interest and attorneys’ fees. Neither
the likelihood, nor the amount of any potential exposure to the Company is
estimable at this time.

On August 21, 2007, Lonestar
Inventions, L.P. (Lonestar) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Xilinx
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division
(Lonestar Inventions, L.P. v. Xilinx, Inc. Case No. 6:07-CV-393). The lawsuit
pertained to a single patent and Lonestar sought injunctive relief, unspecified
damages and interest and attorneys’ fees. The parties reached a confidential
agreement to settle the action and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on
December 18, 2008. The amount of the settlement did not have a material impact
on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

On November 27, 2006, the Company
settled a patent infringement lawsuit under which the Company agreed to pay $6.5
million. The plaintiff agreed to dismiss the patent infringement lawsuit with
prejudice, granted a patent license to the Company and executed an agreement not
to sue the Company under any patent owned or controlled by the plaintiff for ten
years. As a result of the settlement agreement, the Company recorded a current
period charge of $2.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. The
remaining


balance of $4.0 million represented the
value of the prepaid patent license granted as part of the settlement. This
balance is being amortized over the patent’s remaining useful life of nine
years.

Other Matters

Except as stated above, there are no
pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the Company is a party
or of which any of its property is the subject.

Note 19. Goodwill and
Acquisition-Related Intangibles

As of March 28, 2009 and March 29,

million, respectively. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.
Based on the carrying value of acquisition-related intangibles recorded as of
March 28, 2009, and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets,
the annual amortization expense for acquisition-related intangibles is expected
to be as follows: 2010 - $1.5 million; 2011 - $1.0 million.

Note 20. Employee Benefit
Plans

Xilinx offers various retirement
benefit plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total contributions to these
plans were $9.9 million, $8.1 million and $5.9 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. For employees in the U.S., effective July 1, 2008, Xilinx
instituted a Company matching program pursuant to which the Company will match
contributions to Xilinx’s 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan) based on the amount of
salary deferral contributions the participant makes to the 401(k) Plan. Xilinx
will match up to 50% of the first 8% of an employee’s compensation that the
employee contributed to their 401(k) account. Because the program was introduced
mid-year, the maximum Company match for calendar year 2008 was $2,250 per
employee. For calendar year 2009 and beyond, the maximum Company contribution
per year is $4,500 per employee. Prior to July 1, 2008, the Company made
discretionary contributions to employee 401(k) accounts when performance targets
were met. As permitted under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the
401(k) Plan allows tax deferred salary deductions for eligible employees. The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the 401(k) Plan.
Participants in the 401(k) Plan may make salary deferrals of up to 25% of the
eligible annual salary, limited by the maximum dollar amount allowed by the
Internal Revenue Code. Effective January 1, 2003, participants who have reached
the age of 50 before the close of the plan year may be eligible to make catch-up
salary deferral contributions, up to 25% of eligible annual salary, limited by
the maximum dollar amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code.

The Company allows its U.S.-based
officers, director-level employees, and its board members to defer a portion of
their compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan). The
Compensation Committee administers the Plan. As of March 28, 2009, there were
approximately 127 participants in the Plan who self-direct their contributions
into investment options offered by the Plan. The Plan does not allow Plan
participants to invest directly in Xilinx’s stock. In the event Xilinx becomes
insolvent, Plan assets are subject to the claims of the Company’s general
creditors. There are no Plan provisions that provide for any guarantees or
minimum return on investments. As of March 28, 2009, Plan assets were $21.3
million and obligations were $26.3 million. As of March 29, 2008, Plan assets
were $27.0 million and obligations were $31.8 million.


Note 21. Subsequent Events

On April 15, 2009, Xilinx announced
restructuring measures designed to drive structural operating efficiencies
across the Company. Xilinx expects to reduce its global workforce by up to 200
positions, or approximately 6% of the Company’s global workforce. These employee
terminations impact various geographies and functions worldwide. Certain
positions were eliminated in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and other
positions will be eliminated over the September, December and March quarters of
fiscal 2010. The reorganization plan is expected to be completed by the end of
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Restructuring charges related to this
restructuring did not impact fiscal 2009.

The Company expects to record total
restructuring charges of approximately $11.0 to $13.0 million in the June
quarter of fiscal 2010 primarily related to severance pay expenses.

Over the longer term, the Company
expects to implement further supply chain efficiencies resulting in additional
restructuring charges totaling approximately $10.0 million over the September,
December and March quarters of fiscal 2010.

On April 21, 2009, the Company’s Board
of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.14 per common share for the first
quarter of fiscal 2010.  The dividend is payable on June 3, 2009 to
stockholders of record on May 13, 2009.

On May 27, 2009, the Company received a
2-1 adverse judicial ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
reversing the Tax Court decision and holding that the Company should include
stock option amounts in its cost sharing agreement with Xilinx Ireland. 
The Company does not agree with the Appeals Court decision and is reviewing its
alternatives as a result of the decision.  See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”
included in Part I and “Note 16. Income Taxes” and “Note 18. Litigation
Settlements and Contingencies.”

and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 28, 2009.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Part IV, Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Xilinx, Inc. at March 28, 2009 and March 29,
2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended March 28, 2009, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 16 to the
consolidated financial statements, on April 1, 2007, the Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes.”

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), Xilinx, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of March
28, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated June 1, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG
LLP,

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Xilinx, Inc.

We have audited Xilinx, Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2009, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Xilinx,
Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Xilinx, Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 28, 2009, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated balance sheets of Xilinx, Inc. as of March 28, 2009
and March 29, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended March 28, 2009 of Xilinx, Inc. and our report dated June 1, 2009 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS
WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures

An evaluation was carried out, under
the supervision of and with the participation of Xilinx, Inc.’s management,
including our CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a–15(e) and 15d–15(e) under the
Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon the
controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the
period covered by this Form 10-K, the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and
forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO
and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended March 28, 2009 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This system of internal control
is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and
transactions are properly recorded and executed in accordance with management’s
authorization. The design, monitoring and revision of the system of internal
control over financial reporting involves, among other things, management’s
judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific
control measures. The effectiveness of the system of internal control over
financial reporting is supported by the selection, retention and training of
qualified personnel and an organizational structure that provides an appropriate
division of responsibility and formalized procedures. The system of internal
control is periodically reviewed and modified in response to changing
conditions.

Because of its inherent limitations, no
matter how well designed, a system of internal control over financial reporting
can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements or all fraud. Further, because of changes in conditions, the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.
Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct
deficiencies as they are identified.

Management has used the criteria
established in the Report ‘

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework’

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to evaluate the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this
evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of March 28, 2009.

The effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2009 has been audited
by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8. of this Form
10-K.
