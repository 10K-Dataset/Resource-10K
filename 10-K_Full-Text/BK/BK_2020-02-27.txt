•

our business may be materially adversely affected by operational risk;

•

our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse events, publicity, government scrutiny or other reputational harm;

the application of our Title I preferred resolution strategy or resolution under the Title II orderly liquidation authority could adversely affect the Parent’s liquidity and financial condition and the Parent’s security holders;

•

impacts from climate change, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, pandemics, global conflicts and other geopolitical events may have a negative impact on our business and operations;

we are dependent on fee-based business for a substantial majority of our revenue and our fee-based revenues could be adversely affected by

slowing in market activity, weak financial markets, underperformance and/or negative trends in savings rates or in investment preferences;

•

weakness and volatility in financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition;

•

changes in interest rates and yield curves could have a material adverse effect on our profitability;

•

we may experience losses on securities related to volatile and illiquid market conditions, reducing our earnings and impacting our financial condition;

•

the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant clients or counterparties, many of whom are major financial institutions and sovereign entities, and our assumption of credit and counterparty risk, could expose us to loss and adversely affect our business;

•

our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity;

•

we could incur losses if our allowance for credit losses, including loan and lending-related commitments reserves, is inadequate;

•

any material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our principal bank subsidiaries, The Bank of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., could increase the cost of funding and borrowing to us and our rated subsidiaries and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and on the value of the securities we issue;

•

new lines of business, new products and services or transformational or strategic project initiatives may subject us to additional risks, and the failure to implement these initiatives could affect our results of operations;

•

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability;

our strategic transactions present risks and uncertainties and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition;

•

tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions may adversely affect our net income, effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition;

•

our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations, including those governing capital and the approval of our capital plan, applicable provisions of Delaware law or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock;

•

the Parent is a non-operating holding company, and as a result, is dependent on dividends from its

subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its IHC to meet its obligations, including with respect to its securities, and to provide funds for share repurchases and payment of dividends to its stockholders; and,

•

changes in accounting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements and future events could have a material impact on our reported financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and other financial data.

All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made, and BNY Mellon undertakes no obligation to update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such forward-looking statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Description of Business

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (NYSE symbol: BK), is a global company headquartered in New York, New York, with

$37.1 trillion

in assets under custody and/or administration and

$1.9 trillion

in assets under management as of

Dec. 31, 2019

.  With its subsidiaries, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784.

We divide our businesses into two business segments, Investment Services and Investment Management.  We also have an Other segment, which includes the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy investments and business exits.

For a further discussion of BNY Mellon’s lines of business, products and services, see the “Overview,” “Summary of financial highlights,” “Fee and other revenue,” “Review of businesses” and “International operations” sections in the MD&A section in the Annual Report and Notes 24 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, of which portions are incorporated herein by reference.  See the “Available Information” section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY Mellon.

Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities.  Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries are:

•

The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state-chartered bank, which houses our Investment Services businesses, including Asset Servicing, Issuer Services, Treasury Services, Clearance and Collateral Management, as well as the bank-advised business of Asset Management; and

•

BNY Mellon, National Association (“BNY Mellon, N.A.”), a national bank, which houses our Wealth Management business.

We have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois.  Most of our asset management businesses, along with our Pershing businesses, are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon.

Each of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority.  The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.

BNY Mellon’s banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”).

The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV (“BNY Mellon SA/NV”) is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe.  It is authorized and regulated as a credit institution by the National Bank of Belgium and is also supervised by the European Central Bank.  BNY Mellon SA/NV has its principal office in Brussels and branches in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Dublin, Ireland; Frankfurt, Germany; London, England; the City of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Milan, Italy; and Paris, France.

Supervision and Regulation

Information on the supervision and regulation of BNY Mellon can be found in the “MD&A – Supervision and Regulation” section in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

BNY Mellon is subject to competition in all aspects and areas of our business.  Our Investment Services business competes with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and cash management services and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Our Investment Management business competes with domestic and international asset management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers.  Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, transaction execution, capital or access to capital, quality and range of products and services offered, technological innovation and expertise, price, reputation, rates, lending limits and customer convenience.  Competition in the financial services industry continues to be intense and we may be at a competitive disadvantage to institutions that are not  similarly subject to extensive regulation, broad-based financial services firms that have the ability to offer a wider range of products and competitors whose compensatory arrangements are not subject to the same regulatory and supervisory frameworks that apply to us.

As part of our business strategy, we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients.  We also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor, and, for this reason, have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area.

For additional discussion regarding competition, see “MD&A – Risk Factors - We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or

increase our profitability” and “MD&A – Risk Factors - Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain employees” in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
