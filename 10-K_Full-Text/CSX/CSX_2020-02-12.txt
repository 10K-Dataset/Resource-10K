CSX CORPORATION

PART I

Company History

A leader in freight rail transportation for more than 190 years, the Company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (“B&O”) – the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827. Since that time, the Company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation.

Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&O through merger and consolidation to create what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors.

CSX Corporation was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries into CSX. The merger allowed the Company to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. Later, the Company’s acquisition of key portions of Conrail, Inc. ("Conrail") allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the Southeast already served by CSXT. This current rail network allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with safe, dependable, environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service.

Competition

The business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads, motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines.

CSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels. For further discussion on the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Regulatory Environment

The Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the United States and Canada. In the U.S., the railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT"), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars, locomotives and hazardous materials requirements. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the Company's properties and operations.

The Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), a component of the Department of Homeland Security, has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications. In Canada, the railroad operations conducted by the Company’s subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency.

CSX CORPORATION

PART I

Although the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated the U.S. rail industry, the STB has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers. The STB regulates routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, rates for non-exempt traffic, acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, among other railroad activities. Any new rules from the STB regarding, among other things, competitive access or revenue adequacy could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure. For further discussion on regulatory risks to the Company, see Item 1A.

Risk Factors

.

Positive Train Control

In 2008, Congress enacted the Rail Safety Improvement Act (the “RSIA”). The legislation included a mandate that all Class I freight railroads implement an interoperable positive train control system (“PTC”) by December 31, 2015. Implementation of a PTC system is designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, over-speed derailments, incursions into established work-zone limits, and train diversions onto another set of tracks. PTC must be installed on all main lines with passenger and commuter operations as well as most of those over which toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials are transported.

On October 29, 2015, the President of the United States signed the Positive Train Control Enforcement and Implementation Act of 2015 into law extending the deadline. In accordance with this Act, the Company completed installation of all PTC hardware by December 31, 2018. The Company met all criteria required by the Act to be approved for an extension by the FRA. The PTC system is now required to be fully operational by December 31, 2020. CSX remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement.

The Company expects to continue incurring capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC as well as related ongoing operating expenses. CSX currently estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be approximately

$2.4 billion

for the Company. Total PTC investment through


was $

2.3 billion

CSX CORPORATION

PART I

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

New legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.

Legislation passed by Congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies or executive orders issued by the President of the United States could significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability.

Government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.

The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. For example, the RSIA, as amended, mandated that the installation of PTC hardware be completed by December 31, 2018, and requires that the PTC system be fully operational by December 31, 2020 on main lines that carry certain hazardous materials and on lines that have commuter or passenger operations. Although CSX remains on track to meet this regulatory requirement, noncompliance with these and other applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.

CSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.

A train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations.  Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.  Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.

CSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials.  In November 2008, the TSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail.  Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.

CSX CORPORATION

PART I

The Company faces competition from other transportation providers.

The Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.

Global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.

A decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.

Increases in production and source locations of natural gas in the U.S. have resulted in lower natural gas prices in CSX’s service territory. As a result of sustained low natural gas prices, many coal-fired power plants have been displaced by natural gas-fired power generation facilities. If natural gas prices were to remain low, additional coal-fired plants could be displaced, which would likely further reduce the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues. Additionally, crude oil prices combined with increased pipeline activity have resulted in volatility in domestic crude oil production, which has affected crude oil volumes for CSX.

The Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.

The Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The performance and reliability of the Company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach or other operational difficulties.  Such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital, insurance or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the Company's infrastructure. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages. A disruption or compromise of the Company's information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could have a material adverse effect.

PART I

The Company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change.

There is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the Company's operational territory, which could impact the Company's network or other assets. Climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles.

Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.

The Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which CSX is responsible. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.

The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.

The Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.

As part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits.  Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.

CSX 2019 Form 10-K p.


CSX CORPORATION

PART I

Disruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.

The capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail, and ties) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's operating costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.

Network constraints could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency.

CSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) increased volume; (ii) locomotive or crew shortages; (iii) extreme weather conditions; (iv) impacts from changes in yard capacity, or network structure or composition, including train routes; (v) increased passenger activities; or (vi) regulatory changes impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.

Future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.

Terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available.

Furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.

Severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.

The Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.

CSX 2019 Form 10-K p.


CSX CORPORATION

PART I

Failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages.

Most of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the union. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members.

The unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand.

Marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company believes that it has adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period.

Weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.

The Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.

Item 2.  Properties

The Company’s properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and equipment. These categories and the geography of the network are described below.

Track and Infrastructure

Serving


states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York, Philadelphia and Boston in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the midwestern markets of St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago.

CSXT’s track structure includes mainline track, connecting terminals and yards, track within terminals and switching yards, sidings used for passing trains, track connecting CSXT's track to customer locations and track that diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts. Total track miles, which reflect the size of CSXT’s network that connects markets, customers and western railroads, are greater than CSXT’s approximately

20,000

route miles. At December


, the breakdown of track miles was as follows:

In addition to its physical track structure, the Company operates numerous yards and terminals for rail and intermodal service. These serve as points of connectivity between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where railcars and intermodal containers are received, classed for destination and placed onto outbound trains, or arrive and are delivered to the customer. The Company’s largest yards and terminals based on 2019 volume (number of railcars or intermodal containers processed) are listed below.

Network Geography

CSXT’s operations are primarily focused on four major transportation networks and corridors which are defined geographically and by commodity flows below.

Interstate 90 (I-90) Corridor

– This CSXT corridor links Chicago and the Midwest to metropolitan areas in New York and New England. This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks (referred to as double track). These engineering attributes permit the corridor to support high-speed service across intermodal, automotive and merchandise commodities. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through western ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90 Corridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the Midwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, coal and intermodal.

Interstate 95 (I-95) Corridor

– The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading rail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia, and provides access to major eastern ports.

Southeastern Corridor

– This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and Memphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast.

Coal Network

– The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. The domestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility. CSXT’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S.

Roughly one-third

of the tons of export coal and

the majority

of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity.

See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network. Also included on the map, CSX Operating Agreement indicates areas within which CSX can operate through trackage rights beyond the CSX network.

Locomotives

At December


, CSXT owned more than

3,500

locomotives. From time to time, the Company also short-term leases locomotives based on business needs. Freight locomotives are used primarily to pull trains while switching locomotives are used in yards. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain. Of owned locomotives, approximately 65% were in active service as of December 31, 2019, and the remainder were in storage to be utilized as needed. Storing locomotives and equipment allows the Company to quickly adjust its active fleet based on demand and other factors while avoiding delays due to supply limitations or excessive lead times to acquire additional equipment. At December

PART II

Revenue

In 2019, revenue

decreased

$313 million

, or 3%, when compared to the previous year due to volume declines, lower other revenue and decreases in fuel recovery. These decreases were partially offset by merchandise and intermodal pricing gains and favorable mix.

Merchandise Volume

Chemicals

- Declined due to reduced natural gas liquids and fly ash shipments, partially offset by growth in crude oil as well as industrial and municipal waste.

Agricultural and Food Products

- Increased due to gains in feed grain and ingredients, ethanol, as well as sweeteners and oils.

Automotive

- Declined due to lower passenger car shipments, partially offset by higher shipments of trucks and SUVs.

Minerals

- Increased due to higher shipments for highway construction and paving projects.

Forest Products

- Increased due to higher demand for wood pulp and other fiber products as well as lumber, partially offset by reduced pulpboard shipments.

Metals and Equipment

- Declined due to reduced metals shipments, primarily in the steel, construction and scrap markets.

Fertilizers

- Declined due to unfavorable weather conditions throughout the year that impacted fertilizer applications.

Coal Volume

Domestic coal declined primarily due to lower shipments of utility coal as a result of continued competition from natural gas, partially offset by stronger shipments for coke, iron ore and other coal. Export coal declined due to lower international shipments of both thermal and metallurgical coal as global benchmark prices declined.

Intermodal Volume

Domestic and international intermodal declined primarily due to rationalization of low-density lanes.

Other

Other revenue decreased $64 million versus prior year primarily due to lower revenue for storage at intermodal facilities and a decrease in settlements from customers that did not meet volume commitments. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable contract settlement with a customer.

Expense

In


, total expenses

decreased

$409 million

, or

6%

, compared to prior year. Descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.

Labor and Fringe

expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses

decreased

$122 million

due to the following items:

•

Efficiency and volume savings of $157 million primarily resulted from lower headcount and reduced crew starts.

•

Incentive compensation decreased $12 million primarily due to lower expected annual incentive payouts, partially offset by the acceleration of stock compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees.

•

Other costs increased $47 million primarily due to inflation that was partially offset by several non-significant items.

Materials, Supplies and Other

expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services and professional services. This category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items including gains on property dispositions. Total materials, supplies and other expenses

decreased

$183 million

driven by the following:

•

Efficiency and volume savings of $201 million primarily resulted from lower operating support costs, reduced equipment maintenance expenses and lower terminal and trucking costs.

•

Gains from real estate and line sales were $151 million in 2019 compared to $154 million in 2018.

•

All other costs increased $15 million primarily due to inflation and favorable adjustments to casualty reserves in 2018, partially offset by other items.

Depreciation

expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense

increased

$18 million

due to a larger asset base and a 2019 equipment depreciation study that resulted in $10 million of additional expense, partially offset by other non-significant items.

Fuel

expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense

decreased

$140 million

primarily due to an 8% price decrease that drove savings of $74 million, a 4% improvement in fuel efficiency and volume savings.

Equipment and Other

expenses include rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses

increased

$13 million

primarily due to inflation as well as several non-significant items, partially offset by volume and efficiency savings.

Equity Earnings of Affiliates

includes earnings from operating equity method investments. Equity earnings of affiliates decreased $5 million primarily due to lower net earnings at TTX.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Interest Expense

Interest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and finance leases. Interest expense

increased

$98 million

to

$737 million

primarily due to higher average debt balances, partially offset by lower average rates.

Other Income - Net

Other Income - Net includes investment gains, losses and interest income, as well as components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. Other income

increased

$14 million

to

$88 million

primarily due to increased interest income as a result of higher average investment balances.

Income Tax Expense

Income Tax Expense

decreased

$10 million

primarily due to tax benefits from the impacts of stock option exercises and the vesting of other equity awards as well as the resolution of certain state tax matters, partially offset by benefits in 2018 related to state legislative changes and a federal deferred tax adjustment.

Net Earnings and Earnings per Diluted Share

Net Earnings

increased

$22 million

to

$3.3 billion

, and earnings per diluted share

increased

$0.33

to

$4.17

, due to the factors mentioned above. Average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.

2018 vs. 2017 Results of Operations

See discussion of 2018 results of operations compared to 2017 results of operations in Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Non-GAAP Measures - Unaudited

CSX reports its financial results in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.

2017 Adjusted Operating Results

Management believes that adjusted operating income, adjusted operating ratio, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share, assuming dilution are important in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability. These non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends.

The impact of tax reform and the restructuring charge on 2017 operating results are shown in the following table. There were no adjustments to operating results in 2018 or 2019.

(a) The restructuring charge was tax effected using rates reflective of the applicable tax amounts for each component of the restructuring charge.

(b) The total restructuring charge was $325 million, of which $85 million was included in Restructuring Charge - Non-Operating on the consolidated income statement.

CSX 2019 Form 10-K p.


CSX CORPORATION

PART II

Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow

Management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities, which includes proceeds from property dispositions. Adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of cash payments for restructuring charge. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted free cash flow before dividends

increased

$279 million

year-over-year to

$3.5 billion

primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in property additions.

The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (both non-GAAP measures).

(a) The restructuring charge impact to free cash flow was tax effected using the applicable tax rate of the charge. During 2018 and 2017, the Company made cash payments of $15 million and $187 million, respectively, related to the restructuring charge. Also in 2017, the Company made $30 million in payments to a former CEO and a former President for previously accrued non-qualified pension benefits that are not included in the restructuring charge.

Operating Statistics

(Estimated)

(a) The methodology for calculating train velocity and dwell differ from that prescribed by the STB as the Company believes these numbers more accurately reflect railroad performance. CSXT will continue to report train velocity and dwell, using the prescribed methodology, to the STB on a weekly basis. See additional discussion on the Company's website.

(b) During 2019, the calculation of on-time arrivals has changed to consider a train "on time" if it is delivered within two hours of scheduled arrival. Prior year periods have been restated to conform to this change.

Certain operating statistics are estimated and can continue to be updated as actuals settle.

Key Performance Measures Definitions

Train Velocity

- Average train speed between origin and destination in miles per hour (does not include locals, yard jobs, work trains or passenger trains). Train velocity measures the profiled schedule of trains (from departure to arrival and all interim time), and train profiles are periodically updated to align with a changing operation.

Dwell

- Average amount of time in hours between car arrival to and departure from the yard.

Revenue Ton-Miles (RTM's)

- The movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile.

Gross Ton-Miles (GTM's)

- The movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTM's are calculated by multiplying total train weight by distance the train moved. Total train weight is comprised of the weight of the freight cars and their contents.

On-Time Originations

- Percent of scheduled road trains that depart the origin yard on-time or ahead of schedule.

On-Time Arrivals

- Percent of scheduled road trains that arrive at the destination yard on-time to within two hours of scheduled arrival.

FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index

- Number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours.

FRA Train Accident Rate

- Number of FRA-reportable train accidents per million train-miles.

The Company strives for continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. Investment in training and technology also is designed to allow the Company's employees to have an additional layer of protection that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents. Safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. Continued capital investment in the Company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.

Operating performance continued to improve in 2019, as train velocity and car dwell achieved all-time record levels for the second consecutive year. The operational plan remains focused on delivering further service gains, improving transit times and driving asset utilization while controlling costs.

From a safety perspective, FRA personal injury index and train-accident rate improved 15% and 41% from the prior year, respectively. In 2019, the number of FRA reportable injuries and the number of train accidents were both all-time record lows. The Company is committed to continuous safety improvement and remains focused on reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and the communities in which the Company operates.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. To have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.

Significant Cash Flows

The following charts highlight the components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2019, 2018 and 2017.

In


, the Company generated

$4.9 billion

of cash provided by operating activities, which was

$209 million

higher than prior year primarily driven by favorable working capital activities and higher cash-generating income. In 2018, the Company generated $4.6 billion of cash provided by operating activities, which was $1.2 billion higher than the prior year primarily driven by higher cash-generating income which included the impact of a lower income tax rate, partially offset by lower working capital and other activities.

In


, net cash used in investing activities was

$2.1 billion

, an increase in net spend of

$418 million

from the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net purchases of short-term investments. In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion, an increase of $189 million from the prior year primarily driven by an increase in net short-term investment purchases, partially offset by lower property additions and higher proceeds from property dispositions.

In 2019, net cash used in financing activities was

$2.6 billion

, which represents an increase in net spend of

$148 million

from the prior year primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and higher debt repayments, partially offset by lower share repurchases. In 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $2.5 billion, which represents an increase of $321 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher share repurchases, partially offset by higher net debt issued.

PART II

Sources of Cash and Liquidity

The Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in February 2019 which is unlimited as to amount and may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. In


, CSX issued a total of

$2.0 billion

of new long-term debt.

CSX has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in March 2024. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. See Note 10,

Debt and Credit Agreements

for more information. The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.

Uses of Cash

CSX uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital requirements, repayment of additional indebtedness outstanding from time to time, repurchases of CSX's common stock, capital investments, improvements in productivity and other cost reduction initiatives.

In 2019, CSX continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. Funds used for property additions are further described below.

Planned capital investments for 2020 are expected to be between

$1.6 billion

and $1.7 billion. Of the 2020 investment, the majority will be used to sustain the core infrastructure. The remaining amounts will be allocated to projects supporting service enhancements, productivity initiatives and profitable growth. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash generated from operations.

The Company expects to continue incurring capital costs in connection with the implementation of PTC. CSX estimates that the total multi-year cost of PTC implementation will be approximately $

2.4 billion

. This estimate includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment and developing new technologies. Total PTC spending through 2019 was $

2.3 billion

.

CSX CORPORATION

PART II

CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Company’s ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial performance in the future (see

Risk Factors

under Item 1A of this Form 10-K).

The Company also uses cash for scheduled payments of debt and leases, share repurchases and to pay dividends to shareholders. On February 12, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an 8% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.26 per common share.

Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital

CSX's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. Further, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with

$2.0 billion

of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity

increased

$1.5 billion

from prior year. The increase in assets was primarily due to the net increase in short-term investments of $743 million, the right-of-use lease asset of $532 million resulting from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, and property additions net of retirements of $295 million. The increase in total liabilities and shareholders' equity combined was driven by net earnings of $3.3 billion, the issuance of $2.0 billion in long-term debt and the total lease liability of $550 million resulting from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard. These increases were partially offset by share repurchases of $3.4 billion and dividends paid of $763 million.

Working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital

surplus

of

$1.1 billion

at December


and

$650 million

at December


. The increase in current assets was primarily driven by cash proceeds from the $2.0 billion issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by dividend payments of $763 million and the early redemption of long-term debt originally due October 2020 of $500 million. The increase in current assets was offset by an increase in current liabilities primarily due to the reclassification of $245 million from long-term debt to current maturities of long-term debt.

The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA and Aaa for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.

PART II

The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by CSX's long-term credit ratings. CSX's credit ratings remained stable during


. As of

December 2019

and

December 2018

, S&P's long-term rating on CSX was BBB+ (Stable), and Moody's was Baa1 (Stable). Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.

CSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an investment grade credit profile. Capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors.

SCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

The following tables set forth maturities of the Company's contractual obligations and other significant commitments:

(a) Other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans which are unfunded. No amounts are included for funded pension obligations as no contributions are currently required.

(b) Agreements with Conrail represent minimum future payments of

$138 million

under the shared asset area agreements (see Note 15, Related Party Transactions).

(c) Other commitments of

$82 million

consisted of surety bonds, letters of credit, uncertain tax positions and public private partnerships. Surety bonds of

$36 million

and letters of credit of

$27 million

arise from assurances issued by a third-party that CSX will fulfill certain obligations and are typically a contract, state, federal or court requirement. Uncertain tax positions of

$13 million

, which include interest and penalties, are all included in year


as the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated. Contractual commitments related to public-private partnerships are

$6 million

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

For detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

LABOR AGREEMENTS

Approximately

17,000

of the Company's nearly

21,000

employees are members of a labor union. In November 2019, notices were served to the 13 rail unions that participate in national bargaining to begin negotiations for benefits, wages and work rules for the next labor bargaining round for 2020. Current agreements remain in place until modified by these negotiations. Typically, such negotiations take several years before agreements are reached.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:

•

personal injury, environmental and legal reserves;

•

pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting; and

•

depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method.

Personal Injury, Environmental and Legal Reserves

Personal Injury

Personal Injury reserves of

$129 million

and

$143 million

for


and


, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5,

Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves

Environmental

Environmental reserves were

$74 million

and

$80 million

in


and


, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately


environmentally impaired sites. The Company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:

•

type of clean-up required;

•

nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);

•

extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and

•

number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.

Conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5,

Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves

in the consolidated financial statements.

Legal

The Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations and evidentiary standards. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5,

Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves

in the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, see Item 3.

for further discussion of these items.

Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation.

Beginning in 2020, the CSX Pension Plan is closed to new participants. As of December


, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s pension plans was

$3.1 billion

.

In addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a non-contributory life insurance plan that provide certain benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees, hired prior to 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. Beginning in 2019, both the life insurance benefit for eligible active employees and health savings account contributions made by the Company to eligible retirees younger than 65 were eliminated. Beginning in 2020, the employer-funded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older were eliminated. As a result of these plan amendments, the Company recognized a decrease in 2018 of $102 million in the post-retirement benefit liability. As of December


, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s other post-retirement benefit plans was

$117 million

.

For information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 9,

Employee Benefit Plans

.

The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the

Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic

in the ASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:

•

discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;

•

long-term rate of return on plan assets;

•

salary scale inflation rates; and

•

other assumptions.

The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. These amounts are reviewed by management.

Discount Rates

Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and post-retirement expense.  Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.

The Company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity

.

The weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its


pension and post-retirement obligations are

3.13 percent

and

2.87 percent

, respectively. For


, the weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its pension and post-retirement obligations were

4.24 percent

and

3.98 percent

, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement benefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December


, the estimated duration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately


years and


years, respectively.

Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.

Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was

6.75 percent

in both


and


.

Salary Scale Inflation Rates

Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company.  The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of

4.60 percent

in both


and


to value its pension obligations.

Other Assumptions

The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.


Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense

Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for


are expected to be a $5 million expense and a $2 million credit, respectively. Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2020 are expected to include service cost expense of $40 million and $1 million, respectively. Service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense are included in other income - net. Net periodic pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense in 2019 were credits of

$7 million

and

$4 million

, respectively. The net increase in the expected expense is primarily due to impacts from the decline in discount rates, partially offset by favorable pension asset experience.

The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a one percent change in certain assumptions like discount rates, long-term rate of return and salaries on the 2020 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:

Depreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method

The depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise

87%

of total fixed assets of

$45 billion

on a gross basis at December 31,


. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis

.

Land is not depreciated.

Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:

•

statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;

•

statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;

•

evaluation of current operations;

•

evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;

•

previous assessment of the condition of the assets;

•

management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;

•

expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and

•

comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.

In 2019, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. The effect of this change in estimate was not material to depreciation expense in 2019. The continued impacts of the study are expected to result in additional depreciation expense of approximately

$30 million

in 2020. There were no depreciation studies in 2018 or 2017. A

one percent

change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate

$12 million

change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense. For additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see Note 6,

•

loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees;

•

labor and benefit costs and labor difficulties, including stoppages affecting either the Company's operations or customers' ability to deliver goods to the Company for shipment;

•

the Company's success in implementing its strategic, financial and operational initiatives;

•

the impact of conditions in the real estate market on the Company's ability to sell assets;

•

changes in operating conditions and costs or commodity concentrations; and

•

the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions.

Other important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified elsewhere in this report and in CSX's other SEC reports, which are accessible on the SEC's website at

www.sec.gov

and the Company's website at

www.csx.com

.  The information on the CSX website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. As of

December 2019

, CSX does not have a material amount of floating rate debt obligations outstanding, and therefore fluctuations in the interest rate would not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt. The potential decrease in fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates, or approximately 25 basis points, is estimated to be $498 million as of December 31, 2019 and $472 million as of December 31, 2018. The underlying fair values of our long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.

Fiscal Year

Through the second quarter 2017, CSX followed a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar with the last day of each reporting period ending on a Friday. On July 7, 2017, the Board of Directors of CSX approved a change in the fiscal reporting calendar from a 52/53 week year ending on the last Friday of December to a calendar year ending on December 31 each year, effective beginning with fiscal third quarter 2017. Related to the change in the fiscal calendar, 2019 and 2018 both contained 365 days while 2017 contained 366 days.

This change did not materially impact comparability of the Company’s financial results for fiscal year 2017. Accordingly, the change to a calendar fiscal year was made on a prospective basis and operating results for prior periods were not adjusted. The Company was not required to file a transition report because this change was not deemed a change in fiscal year for purposes of reporting subject to Rule 13a-10 or Rule 15d-10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as the new fiscal year commenced with the end of the prior fiscal year end. Except as otherwise specified, references to full years indicate CSX’s fiscal years ended on December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include results of operations of CSX and subsidiaries over which CSX has majority ownership or financial control. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Most investments in companies that were not majority-owned were carried at cost (if less than


%

owned and the Company has no significant influence) or were accounted for under the equity method (if the Company has significant influence but does not have control). These investments are reported within Investment in Conrail or Affiliates and Other Companies on the consolidated balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

On a daily basis, cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in various highly liquid investments having a typical maturity date of

three

months or less at the date of acquisition. These investments are carried at cost, which approximated market value, and are classified as cash equivalents.

Investments

Investments in instruments with original maturities greater than

three

months that will mature in less than

one

year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with original maturities of

one

year or greater are initially classified within other long-term assets, and the classification is re-evaluated at each balance sheet date.

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies in the consolidated balance sheets are carried at average costs and consist primarily of parts used in the repair and maintenance of track structure, equipment, and CSXT’s freight car and locomotive fleets, as well as fuel.

New Accounting Pronouncements

I

n February 2016, the FASB issued ASU,

Leases

, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability. Lessor accounting under the standard is substantially unchanged. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures are also required. CSX adopted the standard effective January 1, 2019 using the cumulative-effect adjustment transition method, which applies the provisions of the standard at the effective date without adjusting the comparative periods presented. The Company adopted the following practical expedients and elected the following accounting policies related to this standard update:

•

Carry forward of historical lease classifications and current accounting treatment for existing land easements;

•

Short-term lease accounting policy election allowing lessees to not recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less; and

•

The option to not separate lease and non-lease components for certain equipment lease asset categories such as freight car, vehicles and work equipment.

Adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of

$


million

on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019

.

This amount is lower than previous estimates due to a lease amendment. The Company’s accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged

.

The standard did not materially impact operating results or liquidity. Disclosures related to the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases are included in Note 7,

Leases

.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

, which replaces current methods for evaluating impairment of financial instruments not measured at fair value, including trade accounts receivable and certain debt securities, with a current expected credit loss model. CSX adopted this new standard update effective January 1, 2020. Adoption will not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:

•

personal injury, environmental and legal reserves (see Note 5,

Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves

);

•

pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting (see Note 9,

Employee Benefit Plans

); and

•

depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method (see Note 6,

Properties

).

Restructuring Charge

Through an involuntary separation program with enhanced benefits to further its strategic objectives, CSX reduced its management workforce by approximately


employees during 2017. The Company was focused on driving efficiencies through process improvement and responding to business mix shifts. These management reductions were designed to further streamline general and administrative and operating support functions to speed decision making and further control costs. The involuntary separation program was essentially completed in April 2017.

The restructuring charge in 2017 includes costs related to the management workforce reduction program, executive retirements, reimbursement arrangements with MR Argent Advisor LLC (“Mantle Ridge”) and the Company’s former President and Chief Executive Officer, E. Hunter Harrison, the proration of equity awards and other advisory costs related to the leadership transition. Payments related to the 2017 restructuring charge were substantially complete as of March 31, 2018.

Earnings Per Share

The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings per share and earnings per share, assuming dilution:

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and common stock equivalents adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of potentially dilutive instruments. CSX's potentially dilutive instruments are made up of equity awards including performance units and employee stock options.

When calculating diluted earnings per share, the potential shares that would be outstanding if all outstanding stock options were exercised are included. This number is different from outstanding stock options, which is included in Note 4,

Stock Plans and Share-Based Compensation

, because it is offset by shares CSX could repurchase using the proceeds from these hypothetical exercises to obtain the common stock equivalent.

Approximately


thousand

7.6

million

of total average outstanding stock options for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect was antidilutive.

Share repurchases may be made through a variety of methods including, but not limited to, open market purchases, purchases pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, accelerated share repurchases and negotiated block purchases. The timing of share repurchases depends upon management's assessment of marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances. Shares are retired immediately upon repurchase. In accordance with the

Equity Topic

in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), the excess of repurchase price over par value is recorded in retained earnings.

Share Repurchase Activity

During 2019, 2018, and 2017, CSX repurchased the following shares:

On October 17, 2019, the Company repurchased

4.7

NOTE 4.

Stock Plans and Share-Based Compensation

Under CSX's share-based compensation plans, awards consist of performance units, stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards for management and stock grants for directors. Awards granted under the various programs are determined and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or, in certain circumstances, by the full Board for awards to the Chief Executive Officer or by the Chief Executive Officer for awards to management employees other than senior executives. The Board of Directors approves awards granted to CSX's non-management directors upon recommendation of the Governance Committee.

Share-based compensation expense for awards under share-based compensation plans and purchases made as part of the employee stock purchase plan is measured using the fair value of the award on the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of the respective award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

Total pre-tax expense and income tax benefits associated with share-based compensation are shown in the table below. Income tax benefits include impacts from option exercises and the vesting of other equity awards. Modifications to the terms of awards (see Equity Award Modifications below) impacted share-based compensation expense in 2017.

Long-term Incentive Plans

The CSX Long-term Incentive Plans (“LTIP”) were adopted under the 2010 CSX Stock and Incentive Award Plan. On May 3, 2019, shareholders approved the CSX 2019 Stock and Incentive Award Plan, under which future awards will be granted. The objective of these plans is to motivate and reward certain employees for achieving and exceeding certain financial goals. Grants were made in performance units, with each unit being equivalent to

one

share of CSX common stock, and payouts will be made in CSX common stock. The payout range for most participants will be between


%

and


%

of the target awards depending on Company performance against predetermined goals for each

three

-year cycle. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, target performance units were granted to certain employees under

three

separate LTIP plans covering

three

-year cycles: the 2019-2021 ("2019-2021 LTIP"), the 2018-2020 (“2018-2020 LTIP”), and the 2017-2019 (“2017-2019 LTIP”) plans.

The key financial targets for the 2017-2019 LTIP plan are based on the achievement of goals related to both operating ratio and return on assets (tax-adjusted operating income divided by net property) excluding certain items as disclosed in the Company's financial statements. The

three

-year cumulative operating ratio and average return on assets over the performance period will each comprise


%

of the payout and are measured independently of the other. This plan states that payouts for certain executive officers are subject to downward adjustment by up to


%

based upon total shareholder return relative to specified comparable groups.

Payouts of performance units for the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 LTIP plans will be based on the achievement of goals related to both operating ratio and free cash flow, in each case excluding non-recurring items as disclosed in the Company’s financial statements. For the 2018-2020 LTIP plan, the final year operating ratio and cumulative free cash flow over the plan period will each comprise


%

of the payout and will be measured independently of the other. For the 2019-2021 LTIP plan, the cumulative operating ratio and cumulative free cash flow over the plan period will each comprise


%

of the payout and will be measured independently of the other. For these plans, payouts for certain executive officers are subject to formulaic upward or downward adjustment by up to


%

, capped at an overall payout of


%

for the 2018 plan and


%

for the 2019 plan, based upon the Company’s total shareholder return relative to specified comparable groups over the performance period.

The fair value of the performance units awarded during the years ended December 2019 and 2018 were calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

As of December 2019, there was

two years

.

Stock Options

Stock options in 2019, 2018, and 2017 were primarily granted along with the corresponding LTIP plans. Under this program, an employee receives an award that provides the opportunity in the future to purchase CSX shares at the closing market price of the stock on the date the award is granted (the strike price). Options granted in 2019 become exercisable either in equal installments on the anniversary of the grant date over a vesting period (three-year graded), or

three years

after the grant date (three-year cliff), depending on the individual grant. The options granted in 2018 and 2017 vest

three years

after the grant date (three-year cliff). All options expire


years

from the grant date if they are not exercised.

The fair value of stock options granted was estimated as of the dates of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option model which uses the following assumptions: dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, annualized volatility and expected life.  The annual dividend yield is based on the most recent quarterly CSX dividend payment annualized. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The annualized volatility is based on historical volatility of daily CSX stock price returns over a

6.1

year look-back period ending on the grant date. The expected life is calculated using the safe harbor approach due to lack of historical data on CSX options, which is the midpoint between the vesting schedule and contractual term (


years

).

In March 2017, the Company granted


million

stock options to former CEO E. Hunter Harrison at a fair value of

$

12.88

per option. These options were granted with a


-year term and an exercise price equal to the closing market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Upon his death in December 2017, all of Mr. Harrison's


million

options were forfeited.

Equity Award Modifications

In 2017, as part of an enhanced severance benefit under the management streamlining and realignment initiative discussed in Note 1, unvested performance units, restricted stock units and stock options for separated employees not eligible for retirement were permitted to vest on a pro-rata basis.  Additionally, the terms of unvested equity awards for a former Chief Executive Officer, Michael J. Ward, and a former President, Clarence W. Gooden, were modified prior to their retirements on March 6, 2017 to permit prorated vesting through May 31, 2018.

The award modifications impacted approximately

Personal injury and environmental reserves are considered critical accounting estimates due to the need for management judgment. In the table above, the impacts of changes in estimates are included in the charged to expense amount and were not material in 2019, 2018, or 2017.

Casualty, environmental and other reserves are provided for in the consolidated balance sheets as shown in the table below.

These liabilities are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with the

Contingencies Topic

in the ASC.  Actual settlements and claims received could differ and final outcomes of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty. Considering the legal defenses currently available, the liabilities that have been recorded and other factors, it is the opinion of management that none of these items individually, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Should a number of these items occur in the same period, however, their combined effect could be material in that particular period.

Casualty

Casualty reserves of

$


million

and

$


million

for


and


, respectively, represent accruals for personal injury, occupational disease and occupational injury claims. The Company increased its self-insured retention amount for these claims from

$


million

to

$


million

per occurrence for claims occurring on or after June 1, 2018. Currently,

no

individual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT.

In accordance with the

Contingencies Topic

in the ASC, to the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries.

These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes in estimate. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. Changes in casualty reserves are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.

Personal Injury

Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries.  Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers' Liability Act ("FELA"). CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims.  An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. This analysis did not result in a material adjustment to the personal injury reserve in 2019, 2018 or 2017.

Occupational

Occupational reserves represent liabilities for occupational disease and injury claims. Occupational disease claims arise primarily from allegations of exposure to asbestos in the workplace. Occupational injury claims arise from allegations of exposure to certain other materials in the workplace, such as solvents, soaps, chemicals (collectively referred to as “irritants”) and diesel fuels (like exhaust fumes) or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries. An analysis performed by management did not result in a material adjustment to the occupational reserve in 2019, 2018 or 2017.

Environmental

Environmental reserves were

$


million

and

$


million

for


and


, respectively. The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately


environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.

In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.

In accordance with the

Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic

in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:

•

type of clean-up required;

•

nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);

•

extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and

•

number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.

Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are reasonably estimable and probable. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.

Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the estimated cost of remedial actions currently required.

Capital Expenditures

The Company’s capital investment includes purchased and self-constructed assets and property additions that substantially extend the service life or increase the utility of those assets. Indirect costs that can be specifically traced to capital projects are also capitalized. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and expanding its network capacity for long-term growth. Rail operations are capital intensive and CSX accounts for these costs in accordance with GAAP and the Company’s capitalization policy. All properties are stated at historical cost less an allowance for accumulated depreciation.

The Company’s largest category of capital investment is the replacement of track assets and the acquisition or construction of new assets that enable CSX to enhance its operations or provide new capacity offerings to its customers. These construction projects are primarily completed by CSXT employees.

Costs for track asset replacement and capacity projects that are capitalized include:

•

labor costs, because many of the assets are self-constructed;

•

costs to purchase or construct new track or to prepare ground for the laying of track;

•

welding (rail, field and plant) which are processes used to connect segments of rail;

•

new ballast, which is gravel and crushed stone that holds track in line;

•

fuels and lubricants associated with tie, rail and surfacing work which is the process of raising track to a designated elevation over an extended distance;

•

cross, switch and bridge ties which are the braces that support the rails on a track;

•

gauging which is the process of standardizing the distance between rails;

•

handling costs associated with installing rail, ties or ballast;

•

usage charge of machinery and equipment utilized in construction or installation; and

•

other track materials.

Labor is a significant cost in self-constructed track replacement work. CSXT engineering employees directly charge their labor to the track replacement project (the capitalized depreciable property). In replacing track, these employees concurrently perform deconstruction and installation of track material. Because of this concurrent process, CSX must estimate the amount of labor that is related to deconstruction versus installation. As a component of the depreciation study for road and track assets, management performs an analysis of labor costs related to the self-constructed track replacement work, which includes direct observation of track replacement processes. Through this analysis, CSX determined that approximately


%

of labor costs associated with track replacement is related to the deconstruction of old track, for which certain elements are expensed, and


%

is associated with the installation of new track, which is capitalized.

Capital investment related to locomotives and freight cars comprises the second largest category of the Company’s capital assets. This category includes purchases of locomotives and freight cars as well as certain equipment leases that are considered to be finance leases in accordance with the

Leases Topic

in the ASC. In addition, costs to modify or rebuild these assets are capitalized if the investment incurred extends the asset’s service life or improves utilization. Improvement projects must meet specified dollar thresholds to be capitalized and are reviewed by management to determine proper accounting treatment. Routine repairs, overhauls and other maintenance costs, for all asset categories, are expensed as incurred.

Depreciation Method

The depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method.  Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise


%

of total fixed assets of

$

45.1

billion

on a gross basis as of December 2019. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated.

The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used and depreciated to the end of its group’s recoverable life.  The Company currently utilizes different depreciable asset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method. By utilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets.  All assets of the Company are depreciated on a time or life basis.

The group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the nature of most of its assets (e.g. track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most accurate and effective way to properly depreciate its assets.

Estimated Useful Life

Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study is the periodic review of asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the STB, the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed every

three years

for equipment assets (e.g. locomotives and freight cars) and every

six years

for road and track assets (e.g. bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). The Company believes the frequency of depreciation studies currently required by the STB, complemented by annual data reviews conducted by a third-party specialist and analyzed by the Company's management, provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets.

In 2019, the Company completed a depreciation study for its equipment assets which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. The effect of this change in estimate was not material to depreciation expense in 2019. The continued impacts of the study are expected to result in additional depreciation expense of approximately

$


million

in 2020. The Company plans to complete the next depreciation study for road and track assets in 2020 and equipment assets in 2022.

Group-Life Assets Sales and Retirements

Since the rail network is one contiguous, connected network it is impractical to maintain specific identification records for these assets. For track assets (e.g. rail, ties, and ballast), CSX utilizes a first-in, first-out approach to asset retirements. Equipment assets (e.g. locomotives and freight cars) are specifically identified at retirement. When an equipment asset is retired that has been depreciated using the group-life method, the cost is reduced from the cost base and recorded in accumulated depreciation.

For sales or retirements of assets depreciated under the group-life method that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is immediately recognized. This practice is consistent with accounting treatment prescribed under the group-life method. As part of the depreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with the group-life method is that the assets within the group on average have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.

For sales or retirements of assets depreciated under the group-life method that do not occur in the ordinary course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the sale or retirement meets each of the following three criteria: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is material in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies.

No

material gains or losses were recognized on the sale of assets depreciated using the group-life method in 2019, 2018, or 2017 as no sales met the criteria described above.

Land and Straight-line Assets Sales and Retirements

When the Company sells or retires land, land-related easements or assets depreciated under the straight-line method, a gain or loss is recognized in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated statements of income

. In 2019, the Company recognized gains on the sale of properties of

$


million

as a result of its initiative to monetize non-core properties. In 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized gains on the sale of properties of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively.

Impairment Review

Properties and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or business conditions indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Initial assessments of recoverability are based on estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows associated with an asset or a group of assets in accordance with the

Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic

in the ASC. Where impairment is indicated, the assets are evaluated and their carrying amount is reduced to fair value based on discounted net cash flows or other estimates of fair value.

In 2019, impairment expense of

$


million

was related to an intermodal terminal sale agreement. In 2018 and 2017, impairment expense of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, was primarily due to the discontinuation of certain in-progress projects. Impairment expense is recorded in materials, supplies and other expense on the consolidated income statement.

Leases

CSX has various lease agreements with terms up to


years

, including leases of land, land with integral equipment (e.g. track), buildings and various equipment. Some leases include options to purchase, terminate or extend for one or more years. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.

At inception, the Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease and whether that lease meets the classification criteria of a finance or operating lease. Some of the Company’s lease arrangements contain lease components (e.g. minimum rent payments) and non-lease components (e.g. maintenance, labor charges, etc.). The Company generally accounts for each component separately based on the estimated standalone price of each component. For certain equipment leases, such as freight car, vehicles and work equipment, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

Certain of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments that are adjusted periodically for an index or rate. The leases are initially measured using the projected payments adjusted for the index or rate in effect at the commencement date. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Operating Leases

Operating leases are included in right-of-use lease assets, other current liabilities and long-term lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term using the Company’s secured incremental borrowing rates or implicit rates, when readily determinable. Short-term operating leases, which have an initial term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on the balance sheet.

The Company has various lease agreements with other parties with terms up to


years

. Non-cancelable, long-term leases may include provisions for maintenance, options to purchase and options to extend the terms. Lease expense for operating leases, including leases with escalations over their terms, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease expense is recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Lease expense is included in equipment and other rents on the consolidated income statements and is reported net of lease income. Lease income was not material to the results of operations for 2019, 2018 or 2017.

Commitments and Contingencies

Purchase Commitments

CSXT's long-term locomotive maintenance program agreement with a third-party contains commitments related to specific locomotive rebuilds and a long-term maintenance program that covers a portion of CSXT’s fleet of locomotives. The maintenance program costs are based on the maintenance cycle for each covered locomotive, which is determined by the asset's age and type. Expected future costs may change as required maintenance schedules are revised and locomotives are placed into or removed from service. Under CSXT’s current obligations, the agreement will expire no earlier than 2035.

The following table summarizes the number of locomotives covered and CSXT’s payments under the long-term maintenance program.

The total of annual payments under the agreement, including those related to locomotive rebuilds and the long-term locomotive maintenance program, are estimated in the table below.

Insurance

The Company maintains insurance programs with substantial limits for property damage (which includes business interruption) and third-party liability.  A certain amount of risk is retained by the Company on each of the property and liability programs. The Company has a

$


million

per occurrence retention for floods and named windstorms and a

per occurrence retention for property losses other than floods and named windstorms. For claims occurring on or after June 1, 2018, the Company increased its self-insured retention for third-party liability claims from

$

to

$

per occurrence. While the Company believes its insurance coverage is adequate, future claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.

Legal

The Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge practices, tax matters, environmental and hazardous material exposure matters, FELA and labor claims by current or former employees, other personal injury or property claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class actions. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering, among other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period.

The Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss for certain legal proceedings for which a loss is reasonably possible in excess of reserves established. The Company has estimated this range to be

$


million

to

$


million

in aggregate at

December 31, 2019

. This estimated aggregate range is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions. Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate.

Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation

In May 2007, class action lawsuits were filed against CSXT and

three

other U.S.-based Class I railroads alleging that the defendants' fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws. The class action lawsuits were consolidated into

one

case in federal court in the District of Columbia. In 2017, the District Court issued its decision denying class certification. On August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the District Court’s ruling.

The District Court had delayed proceedings on the merits of the consolidated case pending the outcome of the class certification proceedings. The consolidated case is now moving forward without class certification. Because a class was not certified, shippers other than those who brought the original lawsuit in 2007 must decide whether to bring their own individual claim against one or more railroads. Some individual shipper claims have been filed.

CSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit. Accordingly, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously. However, penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe, and resolution of these matters individually or when aggregated could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in that particular period.

Environmental

CSXT is indemnifying Pharmacia LLC (formerly known as Monsanto Company) for certain liabilities associated with real estate located in Kearny, New Jersey along the Lower Passaic River (the “Property”). The Property, which was formerly owned by Pharmacia, is now owned by CSXT. CSXT's indemnification and defense duties arise with respect to several matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), using its CERCLA authority, seeks the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances in the


-mile Lower Passaic River Study Area (the "Study Area”). CSXT, on behalf of Pharmacia, and a significant number of other potentially responsible parties are together conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study of the Study Area pursuant to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA. Pharmacia’s share of responsibility, indemnified by CSXT, for the investigation and cleanup costs of the Study Area may be determined through various mechanisms including (a) an allocation and settlement with EPA; (b) litigation brought by EPA against non-settling parties; or (c) litigation among the responsible parties.

In March 2016, EPA issued its Record of Decision detailing the agency’s mandated remedial process for the lower


miles of the Study Area. Approximately


parties, including Pharmacia, are participating in an EPA-directed allocation process to assign responsibility for costs to be incurred implementing the remedy selected for the lower 8 miles of the Study Area. CSXT is participating in the allocation process on behalf of Pharmacia. At a later date, EPA will select a remedy for the remainder of the Study Area and is expected to again seek the participation of private parties to implement the selected remedy using EPA’s CERCLA authority to compel such participation, if necessary.

CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia with regard to the Property in litigation filed by Occidental Chemical Corporation, which is seeking to recover various costs. These costs include costs for the remedial design of the lower 8 miles of the Study Area, as well as anticipated costs associated with the future remediation of the lower 8 miles of the Study Area and potentially the entire Study Area. Alternatively, Occidental seeks to compel some, or all of the defendants to participate in the remediation of the Study Area.  Pharmacia is one of approximately


defendants in this federal lawsuit filed by Occidental on June 30, 2018.

CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia in a cooperative natural resource damages assessment process related to the Property. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe any indemnification or remediation costs potentially allocable to CSXT with respect to the Property and the Study Area would be material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Plan Assets

The CSX Investment Committee (the “Investment Committee”), whose members are selected by the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for oversight and investment of plan assets. The Investment Committee utilizes an investment asset allocation strategy that is monitored on an ongoing basis and updated periodically in consideration of plan or employee changes, or changing market conditions. Periodic studies provide an extensive modeling of asset investment return in conjunction with projected plan liabilities and seek to evaluate how to maximize return within the constraints of acceptable risk. The current asset allocation targets


%

equity investments and


%

fixed income investments and cash. Within equity, a further target is currently established for


%

of total plan assets in domestic equity and


%

in international equity.  Allocations are evaluated for levels within


%

of targeted allocations and are adjusted quarterly as necessary.

The distribution of pension plan assets as of the measurement date is shown in the table below, and these assets are reported net of pension liabilities on the balance sheet.

Under the supervision of the Investment Committee, individual investments or fund managers are selected in accordance with standards of prudence applicable to asset diversification and investment suitability. The Company also selects fund managers with differing investment styles and benchmarks their investment returns against appropriate indices. Fund investment performance is continuously monitored. Acceptable performance is determined in the context of the long-term return objectives of the fund and appropriate asset class benchmarks.

Within the Company's equity funds, domestic stock is diversified among large and small capitalization stocks. International stock is diversified in a similar manner as well as in developed versus emerging markets stocks. Guidelines established with individual managers limit investment by industry sectors, individual stock issuer concentration and the use of derivatives and CSX securities.

Fixed income securities guidelines established with individual managers specify the types of allowable investments, such as government, corporate and asset-backed bonds, target certain allocation ranges for domestic and foreign investments and limit the use of certain derivatives. Additionally, guidelines stipulate minimum credit quality constraints and any prohibited securities. For detailed information regarding the fair value of pension assets, see Note 13,

. These amounts are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of shareholders’ equity.

Assumptions

The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. This assumption is reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed appropriate.

The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year.

Credit Facilities

In March 2019, CSX replaced its existing

$

1.0

billion

unsecured, revolving credit facility with a new

$

1.2

billion

unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks. The new facility allows same-day borrowings at floating interest rates, based on LIBOR or an agreed-upon replacement, plus a spread that depends upon CSX's senior unsecured debt ratings. LIBOR is the London Interbank Offered Rate which is a daily reference rate based on the interest rates at which banks offer to lend unsecured funds. This facility expires in March 2024, and as of December 31, 2019, the Company had

no

outstanding

balances under this facility.

Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility were similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment-grade borrowers. As of December 31, 2019, CSX was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the facility.

Commercial Paper

Under its commercial paper program, which is backed by the revolving credit facility, the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of

$

1.0

billion

. Proceeds from issuances of the notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2019, the Company had

Revenues

The Company’s revenues are primarily derived from the transportation of freight as performance obligations that arise from its contracts with customers are satisfied.

The following table presents the Company’s revenues disaggregated by market as this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Revenue Recognition

The Company generates revenue from freight billings under contracts with customers generally on a rate per carload, container or ton-basis based on length of haul and commodities carried. The Company’s performance obligation arises when it receives a bill of lading (“BOL”) to transport a customer's commodities at a negotiated price contained in a transportation services agreement or a publicly disclosed tariff rate. Once a BOL is received, a contract is formed whereby the parties are committed to perform, collectability of consideration is probable and the rights of the parties, shipping terms and conditions, and payment terms are identified. A customer may submit several BOLs for transportation services at various times throughout a service agreement term but each shipment represents a distinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation.

The average transit time to complete a shipment is between


to


days depending on market. Payments for transportation services are normally billed once a BOL is received and are generally due within


days after the invoice date. The Company recognizes revenue over transit time of freight as it moves from origin to destination. Revenue for services started but not completed at the reporting date is allocated based on the relative transit time in each reporting period, with the portion allocated for services subsequent to the reporting date considered remaining performance obligations.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

NOTE 11.  Revenues,

continued

The certain key estimates included in the recognition and measurement of revenue and related accounts receivable are as follows:

•

Revenue associated with shipments in transit is recognized ratably over transit time and is based on average cycle times to move commodities and products from their origin to their final destination or interchange;

•

Adjustments to revenue for billing corrections and billing discounts;

•

Adjustments to revenue for overcharge claims filed by customers, which are based on historical payments to customers for rate overcharges as a percentage of total billing; and

•

Incentive-based refunds to customers, which are primarily volume-related, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on the basis of the projected liability (this estimate is based on historical activity, current volume levels and forecasted future volume).

Revenue related to interline transportation services that involve the services of another party, such as another railroad, is reported on a net basis. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to another party is not reflected as revenue.

Other revenue is comprised of revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and incidental charges

,

including demurrage and switching. It is recorded upon completion of the service and accounts for an immaterial percentage of the Company’s total revenue. Revenue from regional subsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad.

During


,


and


, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price), was not material.

Remaining Performance Obligations

Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to future reporting periods for freight services started but not completed at the reporting date

.

This includes the unearned portion of billed and unbilled amounts for cancellable freight shipments in transit. The Company expects to recognize the unearned portion of revenue for freight services in transit within one week of the reporting date. As of

December 31, 2019

, remaining performance obligations were not material.

Contract Balances and Accounts Receivable

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in accounts receivable and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheets.

Contract assets, contract liabilities and deferred contract costs recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of

December 31, 2019

were not material.

The Company recorded a 2019 income tax benefit of

primarily as a result of the additional tax benefit associated with vesting of share-based awards, the settlement of certain state tax matters, federal and state legislative change, and a change in the valuation of deferred taxes as a result of filing the 2018 tax returns.

The Company recorded a 2018 income tax benefit of

$

primarily as a result of the additional tax benefit associated with vesting of share-based awards, state legislative changes, the settlement of certain state tax matters and a change in the valuation of deferred taxes as a result of filing the 2017 tax returns.

With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act" or "tax reform") on December 22, 2017, the Company's 2017 financial results included a

$

3.5

billion

, or

$

%

federal corporate tax rate effective January 1, 2018. During third quarter 2018, the Company filed its 2017 Federal Income Tax return which resulted in an immaterial adjustment to the deferred tax liability and tax expense. Accordingly, the Company's accounting for the federal rate reduction under the the Act is now complete.

The Company's affiliates also revalued their deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower federal corporate tax rate, which resulted in the Company recognizing a benefit in 2017 of

$

Fair Value Measurements

The

Financial Instruments Topic

in the ASC requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in annual reports as well as in quarterly reports. For CSX, this statement applies to certain investments, pension plan assets and long-term debt. Also, the

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic

in the ASC clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.

Various inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company's investments, pension plan assets and long-term debt. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:

•

Level 1 – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;

•

Level 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.); and

•

Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair value of investments).

The valuation methods described below may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Investments

The Company's investment assets, valued with assistance from a third-party trustee, consist of certificates of deposits, commercial paper, corporate bonds and government securities and are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet per the

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic

in the ASC. There are several valuation methodologies used for those assets as described below:

•

Certificates of Deposit and Commercial Paper (Level 2): Valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value; and

•

Corporate Bonds and Government Securities (Level 2): Valued using broker quotes that utilize observable market inputs.

The Company's investment assets are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as summarized in the following table. All of the inputs used to determine the fair value of the Company's investments are Level 2 inputs. The amortized cost basis of these investments was

$

1.1

billion

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, respectively.

These investments have the following maturities and are represented on the consolidated balance sheet within short-term investments for investments with maturities of less than one year, and other long-term assets for investments with maturities of one year and greater:

Long-term Debt

Long-term debt is reported at carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheets and is the Company's only financial instrument with fair values significantly different from their carrying amounts. The majority of the Company's long-term debt is valued with assistance from a third party that utilizes closing transactions, market quotes or market values of comparable debt. For those instruments not valued by the third party, the fair value has been estimated by applying market rates of similar instruments to the scheduled contractual debt payments and maturities. These market rates are provided by the same third party.  All of the inputs used to determine the fair value of the Company's long-term debt are Level 2 inputs.

The fair value of outstanding debt fluctuates with changes in a number of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, interest rates, market conditions, credit ratings, values of similar financial instruments, size of the transaction, cash flow projections and comparable trades. Fair value will exceed carrying value when the current market interest rate is lower than the interest rate at which the debt was originally issued. The fair value of a company's debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions. It does not impact the financial statements under current accounting rules.

The fair value and carrying value of the Company's long-term debt is as follows:

Pension Plan Assets

Pension plan assets are reported at fair value, net of pension liabilities, on the consolidated balance sheet. The Investment Committee targets an allocation of pension assets to be generally


%

equity and


%

fixed income. There are several valuation methodologies used for those assets as described below.

Investments in the Fair Value Hierarchy

•

Common stock (Level 1):

Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded on the last day of the year and classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

•

Mutual funds (Level 1

): Valued at the net asset value of shares held at year end based on quoted market prices determined in an active market. These assets are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

•

Cash and cash equivalents (Level 1)

:  Includes cash and short term investments with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents at year end approximates fair value. These assets are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

•

Corporate bonds, government securities, asset-backed securities and derivatives (Level 2)

: Valued using price evaluations reflecting the bid and/or ask sides of the market for a similar investment at year end. Asset-backed securities include commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. These assets are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Investments Measured at Net Asset Value

•

Partnerships:

Net asset value of private equity is based on the fair market values associated with the underlying investments at year end. These funds have redemption restrictions that require advanced notice of 15 business days.

•

Common collective trust funds:

This class consists of private funds that invest in government and corporate securities and various short-term debt instruments and are measured at net asset value to estimate the fair value of the investments. The net asset value of the investments is determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying securities, which are valued primarily through the use of directly or indirectly observable inputs. These funds have redemption restrictions that require advanced notice of up to 15 business days.

Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.

Future payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below.

Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX’s


percent

share of Conrail’s income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail’s fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the


acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

CSX’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the management of CSX, including CSX’s CEO and CFO, CSX conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, which is also referred to as COSO. Based on that evaluation, management of CSX concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2019

. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CSX Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited CSX Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

In our opinion, CSX Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of CSX Corporation as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes of the Company and our report dated February 12, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
