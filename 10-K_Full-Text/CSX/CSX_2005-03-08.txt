PART I

Item 1.

Business

CSX Corporation (“CSX” or the “Company”)
operates one of the largest rail networks in the United States
and also arranges for and provides integrated rail and truck
(“intermodal”) transportation services across the
United States and key markets in Canada and Mexico. Its marine
operations, described below under the caption “Discontinued
Operations,” included an international terminal services
company, which operated and developed container terminals,
distribution facilities and related terminal activities. CSX
also owns and operates the Greenbrier, a AAA Five-Diamond resort
located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.

Surface Transportation

CSX Transportation, Inc.

Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, CSX Transportation Inc.
(“CSXT”) is the largest rail network in the eastern
United States, providing rail freight transportation over a
network of more than 22,000 route miles in 23 states, the
District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces.

CSX Intermodal, Inc.

CSX Intermodal Inc. (“CSXI”) is one of the
nation’s largest transcontinental intermodal transportation
service providers, operating a network of dedicated intermodal
facilities across North America. Headquartered in Jacksonville,
Florida, the CSXI network handles approximately 500 dedicated
trains among its 44 terminals weekly.

The rail and intermodal segments are viewed on a combined basis
as Surface Transportation operations.

Discontinued Operations

International Terminals

CSX World Terminals, LLC (“CSXWT”) operates
container-freight terminal facilities in Asia, Europe,
Australia, Latin America and the United States. CSXWT is
headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.

On February 22, 2005 CSX sold its International Terminals
business through the sale of all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of SL Service, Inc. (“SLSI”),
and all of its interest in Orange Blossom Investment Company,
Ltd. to Dubai Ports International FZE (“DPI”) for
closing cash consideration of $1.142 billion, subject to
final working capital and long-term debt adjustments. As a
result of the sale CSX will recognize a pretax gain in the first
quarter of 2005 and expects to tender substantial tax payments
triggered by the transaction beginning in the second quarter of
2005. Of the gross proceeds, approximately $115 million is
allocated for the purchase of a minority interest in an
International Terminals’ subsidiary, acquired in the first
quarter of 2005 and divested as part of the sale to DPI.
Approximately $100 million was paid for this interest
subsequent to December 31, 2004, with the final payment
expected in the first quarter of 2005. The Company is
considering options regarding the use of net cash proceeds
including reduction of debt and other corporate purposes.

SLSI also holds certain residual assets and liabilities as a
result of prior divestitures and discontinuances. A wholly-owned
subsidiary of CSX retains the rights to those assets and
indemnifies DPI, SLSI and related entities against those
liabilities pursuant to a separate agreement. CSX guarantees the
obligations of its subsidiary under this separate agreement.

Consequently, the results of operations and financial position
of the Company’s International Terminals business are
reported as Discontinued Operations for all periods presented.



Divestitures

CSX Lines LLC

In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its interest in its
domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines LLC (“CSX
Lines”), to a new venture formed with The Carlyle Group for
approximately $300 million (gross cash proceeds of
approximately $240 million, $214 million net of
transaction costs, and $60 million of securities). CSX
Lines was subsequently renamed Horizon Lines LLC
(“Horizon”). Horizon subleased vessels and equipment
from certain affiliates of CSX covering the primary financial
obligations related to $265 million of leases under which
CSX or one of its affiliates will remain a lessee/ sublessor or
guarantor. A deferred pretax gain of approximately
$127 million as a result of the transaction is being
recognized over the 12-year sub-lease term. The securities
contained a term of 7 years and a preferred return feature.
During the third quarter of 2003, CSX received a
$15 million payment from Horizon Lines, which included
$3 million of interest, in return of a portion of its
investment in Horizon. The investing section of the 2003
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes proceeds from
divestiture of $226 million and $3 million of interest
on investment is included in net earnings.

In July 2004, Horizon was acquired by an unrelated third party,
and CSX received $59 million, which included
$48 million for the purchase of its ownership interest in
Horizon, $4 million of interest, and a performance payment
of $7 million, which will also be recognized over the
12-year sub-lease term. The investing section of the 2004
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes proceeds from
divestiture of $55 million and $4 million of interest
on investment is included in net earnings. However, CSX and one
of its affiliates will continue to remain a lessee/ sublessor or
guarantor on certain vessels and equipment as long as the
subleases remain in effect. (See Note 19, Commitments and
Contingencies.)

Legal Proceedings

CSX is involved in routine litigation incidental to its business
and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various
governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including
those related to environmental matters, Federal Employers’
Liability Act claims by employees, other personal injury claims,
and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation
rates and charges. Some of the legal proceedings include claims
for compensatory as well as punitive damages, and others purport
to be class actions. While the final outcome of these matters
cannot be predicted with certainty, considering among other
things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities
that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is
the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have
a material adverse effect on the results of operations,
financial position or liquidity of CSX. However, an unexpected
adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a
material adverse effect on the results of operations in a
particular quarter or fiscal year. The Company is also party to
a number of actions, the resolution of which could result in
gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of
operations in the quarters received.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and
other information included in this report. CSX follows a
52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal year 2004
consisted of a 53-week year ending on December 31, 2004.
Fiscal year 2003 consisted of 52 weeks ending on
December 26, 2003.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2004 Surface
Transportation Highlights and Challenges

Revenue

Revenue increased by 8% or $581 million year-over-year, a
portion of which is due to 53 weeks instead of
52 weeks in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.
The fourth quarter of 2004 marked the 11th consecutive quarter
of year-over-year revenue growth. Increased demand for coal was
a primary driver of the revenue growth due to both increased
electricity generation and rebuilding utility stockpile
inventory. In addition, demand created from a generally strong
industrial economy propelled all merchandise markets and CSXI to
record revenue levels. All major markets showed year-over-year
improvement in revenue-per-car due to continued yield management
strategies and the Company’s fuel surcharge program.

Volume

Volume growth during 2004 lagged others in the rail industry due
to service related constraints at CSXT and the Network
Simplification Initiative (“NSI”) at CSXI. Several
markets exhibited potential for additional volume especially
within the coal and metals markets, if the Company’s car
fleet utilization had improved. Furthermore, some customers
diverted traffic to other rail carriers or other modes of
transportation due to service challenges.

In July, CSXI implemented NSI, which eliminated 26 weekly
train starts, in an effort to improve overall contributions by
consolidating volumes on fewer trains. The annualized impact
from NSI is estimated to be increase CSXI’s operating
income by $8 million or approximately 5%.

Fuel Costs and Fuel Surcharge Program

Fuel expenses increased 16% to $656 million in 2004, net of
$63 million of fuel hedging benefits, from
$566 million in 2003 due principally to the rising price
per gallon of diesel fuel. Fuel hedging activity had no impact
on fuel expense for the fiscal year ended December 26,
2003. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel, including
benefits from CSX’s fuel hedging program, was $1.0950 in
2004 versus $0.9564 in 2003. In addition, the fuel surcharge
programs within the Surface Transportation business segment and
contractual cost escalation clauses used in most multi-year
customer contracts partially offset fuel cost increases.

Operations

Fiscal year 2004 proved to be operationally challenging. As
illustrated in the table below, key measures of network
performance declined versus prior year and had an adverse impact
on service



consistency, expenses and CSX’s ability to fully capture
growth opportunities during a period of high demand for
transportation services.

Implementation of the ONE Plan

The ONE Plan was a major initiative launched across the CSX
network in the third quarter of 2004 aimed at improving network
performance. The first phase of the ONE Plan included a complete
redesign of the operating plan for automotive and merchandise
shipments to improve service consistency and efficiency by
reducing terminal handlings and routing miles. With the new
operating plan in place, management focused on consistent
execution and refining the plan in response to changing shipment
volumes and flows. Early results were promising, with key
measures improving sequentially from the third to the fourth
quarter of 2004.

Expenses

CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal
year 2004 consisted of a 53-week year ending on
December 31, 2004. Fiscal year 2003 consisted of
52 weeks ending on December 26, 2003.



Safety

Efforts by the Company to reduce the frequency of personal
injuries and train accidents produced modest improvements on a
year-over-year comparison. The Company’s personal injury
frequency index for 2004 remained unchanged from 2003 levels,
while its FRA train accident frequency improved 4% on a
year-over-year basis. The Company’s safety performance
improved sequentially in the third and fourth quarters.

Organizational Effectiveness Initiative

As of April 2004, CSX concluded the Management Restructuring
program announced in November 2003 to improve the speed of
decision-making by reducing management layers and increasing the
span of control for managers, as well as realigning certain
functions. As a result of this initiative, CSX reduced the
non-union Surface Transportation workforce by 863 positions. The
Company incurred expense associated with this program through
the third quarter of 2004 as final settlement costs were
determined.



Selected Earnings Data



Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under
SEC Regulation G. Management believes, however, that free
cash flow is important in evaluating its financial performance
and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring
additional external financings. Free cash flow should be
considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash
provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles
cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free
cash flow (non-GAAP measure):

International Terminals Divestiture

On February 22, 2005, CSX sold its International Terminals
business through the sale of all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of SLSI, and all of its interest in
Orange Blossom Investment Company, Ltd. to DPI for closing cash
consideration of $1.142 billion, subject to final working
capital and long-term debt adjustments. As a result of the sale,
CSX will recognize a significant gain in the first quarter of
2005 and expects to tender substantial tax payments triggered by
the transaction beginning in the second quarter of 2005. As a
result, amounts related to this business are reported as
Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. On the
Consolidated Income Statement, Discontinued Operations includes
International Terminals’ net earnings of $18 million
as well as additional tax expense of $97 million related to
undistributed foreign earnings. On the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, the amounts related to this business are shown as
International Terminals Assets/Liabilities Held for Sale.

Conrail Spin-off

In the third quarter of 2004, CSX, Norfolk Southern Corporation
and Conrail, Inc. completed a corporate reorganization of
Conrail that resulted in the direct ownership and control by
CSXT of routes and assets that had previously been operated by
CSXT under operating and lease agreements with a Conrail
subsidiary. As a part of the reorganization, CSXT issued new
unsecured debt obligations, which were exchanged for unsecured
debt obligations of Consolidated Rail Corporation
(“CRC”), a Conrail subsidiary. In addition, CSXT
entered into new lease and sublease arrangements with CRC to
support CRC’s secured debt and lease obligations, and a
long-term note due from CSX to Conrail was eliminated. The
reorganization did not affect the Shared Assets Areas, which
continue to be owned and operated by CRC and are reflected in
CSX’s Investment in Conrail as shown in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

The distribution was accounted for at fair value, resulting in a
net gain of $16 million after tax, which is included in
Other Income in the Consolidated Income Statement.



The assets and liabilities acquired at the time of the Conrail
spin-off transaction, as of September 2004, are as follows:

Horizon Lines

In July 2004, CSX received $59 million, which included
$48 million for the purchase of its ownership interest in
Horizon, $4 million of interest, and a performance payment
of $7 million, which will be recognized over 12 years.
However, CSX and one of its affiliates will continue to remain a
lessee/ sublessor or guarantor on $265 million of leases on
certain vessels and equipment as long as the subleases remain in
effect.

Expectations

Revenue

Revenue is expected to continue to outpace volume in 2005 due to
a continued emphasis on price. Lower contributory traffic is
either being re-priced or replaced by longer haul, more
profitable business. The amount of any revenue and volume
increase depends on several factors:

Economy:

Favorable economic conditions are expected based
    on the forecasts for key economic indicators such as the gross
    domestic product, industrial and automotive production as well
    as overall import levels. Generally, CSX’s revenue is
    fairly diversified and a large portion is relatively insensitive
    to significant fluctuations in the general economy. However,
    changes in the macro economic environment do impact overall
    revenue growth.

Operational Performance:

Service is expected to improve
    as management consistently executes the ONE Plan and average
    velocity increases. Consequently, additional volume may be
    captured as freight car availability increases due to improved
    asset utilization and reduced transit times. If service does not
    improve, volume growth could be flat to slightly negative.

Fuel Prices:

Because of the fuel surcharge program and
    cost escalation clauses in long-term contracts, which include a
    fuel element, a portion of CSX’s revenue varies with the
    price of fuel, but these mechanisms only partially offset the
    inflation in fuel prices.

Operations

Improvement in key operating measurements is expected in 2005.
Several factors can affect overall service levels:

Availability of Resources:

Locomotive and train and
    engine employee availability are key resources to execute the
    operating plan. Management believes current resource plans, which



include hiring additional train and engine employees and the
    acquisition of 100 new locomotives, will be sufficient to manage
    anticipated volume while improving service levels.

Volume:

If volume growth significantly exceeds
    management’s expectations, additional train crew hiring and
    locomotive resources may be required, depending on the type and
    location of the volume growth. Deployment of additional
    resources could lag a sudden surge in demand by several months
    due to the time required to hire and train employees and to
    secure additional leased locomotives, subject to availability,
    which could negatively impact overall service levels during that
    period.

Capital Investments

Total capital investments in rail infrastructure, locomotives,
and freight cars are estimated to be $1.1 billion in 2005.
Capital expenditures could increase if the industrial economy
remains strong, additional volume materializes and profitability
targets, including free cash flow, are met.

Free Cash Flow

CSX will continue to focus on free cash flow in 2005, with a
target of approximately $450 million.

Risk Factors

Competition

The Company experiences competition from other transportation
providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate
similar routes across its service area, and to a less
significant extent barges, ships, and pipelines. Transportation
providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public
rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental
entities while CSX and other railroads must build and maintain
its network through the utilization of internal resources. If
the scope and quality of these alternative methods of
transportation are materially increased, or if legislation is
passed providing materially greater opportunity for motor
carriers with respect to size or weight restrictions, there
could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s results
of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

Employees and Labor Union Relationships

The Company considers employee relations with most of its unions
generally to be good. Most of CSXT’s employees are
represented by labor unions and are covered by collective
bargaining agreements. The bargaining agreements contain a
moratorium clause that precludes serving new bargaining demands
until a certain date. These agreements, which usually are
bargained nationally by the National Railway Labor Conference
(“NRLC”), normally contain the same moratorium date so
all bargaining on agreement changes generally begins at
approximately the same time. A round of bargaining started in
2000 when the moratorium provisions expired. Agreements have
been reached with all but one of the unions. Two of those
agreements are out for ratifications. Negotiations with the
union representing the machinists are in mediation. The
machinists have asked the National Mediation Board to be
released from mediation and the railroads have opposed that
request. A new round of bargaining commenced in 2004.

Also, the agreements which were concluded in the 2000 bargaining
round are now open for renegotiation. The process of
renegotiating these agreements commenced in early November 2004
when the parties were free to serve their bargaining demands.
The outcome of the 2004 round of negotiations is uncertain at
this time.

In the rail industry, negotiations have generally taken place
over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any
extended work stoppages. The existing agreements continue to
remain in effect until new agreements are reached. The parties
are not permitted to either strike or lockout until the Railway
Labor Act’s lengthy procedures (which include mediation,
cooling-off periods, and the possibility of Presidential
intervention) are exhausted.



Environmental Laws and Regulation

The Company’s operations are subject to wide-ranging
federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations
concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges
to waters and the handling, storage, transportation and disposal
of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material
or petroleum releases. The Company generates and transports
hazardous and non-hazardous waste and materials in its current
operations, and it has done so in its former operations. In
certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to
formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties and
properties owned by third parties, as well as to properties
currently owned and used by the Company. Environmental
liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted
by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort
litigation. The Company has been and may be subject to
allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or
is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and
such violations can result in the Company’s incurring
fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of
environmental contamination. Although the Company has
appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for
known future environmental costs, it could incur significant
costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and may be required
to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate
known, unknown or future environmental contamination, which
could have a material adverse effect on results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs represent a significant expense of CSX Surface
Transportation operations. Fuel prices can vary significantly
from period to period and significant increases may have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results.
Furthermore, fuel prices and supply are influenced considerably
by international political and economic circumstances. If a fuel
supply shortage arose from OPEC production restrictions, a
disruption of oil imports or otherwise, fuel shortages, higher
fuel prices and any subsequent price increases could, despite
the Company’s fuel surcharge programs, materially adversely
affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

Future Acts of Terrorism or War

Terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred on
September 11, 2001, or in Madrid, Spain on March 11,
2004, any government response thereto and war may adversely
affect results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
The Company’s rail lines and physical plant may be direct
targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror, which could
cause significant business interruption and result in increased
costs and liabilities and decreased revenues and have a material
adverse effect on operating results, financial condition or
liquidity. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or
all of the coverage currently maintained by the Company could
increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available.

Regulation and Legislation

The Company is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the
Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) of the United
States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the
Federal Railroad Administration of DOT and other state and
federal regulatory agencies as to rail operations and for a
variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, and other
matters. Legislation passed by Congress or regulations issued by
these organizations can significantly affect the costs and
profitability of the Company’s business. In addition, the
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could
have a material adverse effect on the Company.

In response to the heightened threat of terrorism in the wake of
the September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, Pentagon
and airline infrastructure, federal, state and local regulatory
agencies are evaluating various proposals with respect to the
transportation industry. Some of these proposals relate to the
transport of hazardous material. Certain metropolitan areas
considered a security risk have been and may continue to be the
subjects of regulation. The ultimate



legislation passed by federal, state and local regulators
related to issues of security has the potential to materially
adversely affect CSX’s operations and costs.

Safety

The Company faces inherent business risk of exposure to property
damage and personal injury claims in the event of train
accidents, including derailments. The Company is also subject to
exposure to occupational injury claims. While CSX is working
diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to
raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety,
the Company cannot ensure that it will not experience any
material property damage, personal or occupational claims in the
future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend
such claims. Additionally, the Company cannot ensure that
existing claims will not suffer adverse development not
currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate
outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors that
are outside of CSX’s control. CSX engages outside parties
to assist with the evaluation of certain of the occupational and
personal injury claims, and believes that it is adequately
reserved to cover all potential claims. However, final amounts
determined to be due on any outstanding matters may differ
materially from the recorded reserves.

Severe Weather

The Company may face severe weather conditions and other natural
occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes
which may cause significant disruptions of the Company’s
operations, and result in increased costs and liabilities and
decreased revenues which could have a material adverse effect on
operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

Financial Results of
Operations

Consolidated Results

CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal
year 2004 consisted of a 53-week year ending on
December 31, 2004. Fiscal year 2003 consisted of
52 weeks ending on December 26, 2003. The results of
operations of the Company’s International Terminals
business are reported as Discontinued Operations for all periods
presented.

(a)

Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current
    presentation.

2004 vs. 2003

Operating Revenue

Operating revenue increased $454 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 to $8.0 billion, compared to
$7.6 billion for the prior year primarily due to continued
yield management strategies as all major markets showed
year-over-year improvement in revenue-per-car coupled with the
Company’s fuel surcharge program.

Operating Income

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2004
increased $480 million to $1.0 billion, compared to
$520 million in the prior year. Operating expenses
decreased $26 million to $7 billion for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2004, principally due to the
absence of charges totaling $340 million taken in 2003 for
(1) the provision for casualty claims, and (2) the
additional loss on sale.

Other Income

Other income decreased $21 million to $72 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to
$93 million for the prior year primarily due to a decline
in income from real estate and resort operations. This decrease
was partially offset by the net gain of $16 million, after
tax, related to the Conrail spin-off transaction.



Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $17 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to the prior year comparable
period due to decreased benefits from interest rate swaps and
the exchange of Conrail debt, as a result of the Conrail
spin-off transaction.

Net Earnings

Earnings from Continuing Operations were $418 million, or
$1.87 per diluted share, for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to $137 million, or 63
cents per diluted share for the prior year.

Losses from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, were
$79 million, or 35 cents per diluted share, for the year
ended December 31, 2004 compared to earnings of
$52 million, or 23 cents per diluted share for the prior
year. Discontinued Operations for the period ended
December 31, 2004, includes International Terminals’
net earnings as well as additional tax expense of
$97 million related to undistributed foreign earnings.

The year ended December 26, 2003 included an after-tax
cumulative effect of accounting change benefit of
$57 million, related to the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.”

Net earnings were $339 million, or $1.52 per diluted
share, for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to
$246 million or $1.11 per share for the prior year.

The increase in the 2004 effective income tax rate compared to
the prior year is primarily attributable to a larger percentage
of total pretax earnings in 2004 than in 2003. Additionally,
2003 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the cumulative
impact of changes in the Company’s deferred effective state
income tax rates.

In 2004, CSX is required to include approximately
10 million shares underlying its convertible debt
instrument using the “if-converted” method in the
computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution. The
dilutive impact for all periods is approximately 2%-5%. Earnings
per share, assuming dilution, has been restated for all periods
presented.

2003 vs. 2002

Operating Revenue

Operating revenue decreased $350 million for the year ended
December 26, 2003 to $7.6 billion, compared to
$7.9 billion for the prior year. A $627 million
decline in consolidated revenue resulted from a reduction of
revenue in the domestic container-shipping segment as a majority
of CSX’s interest in CSX Lines was conveyed during the
first quarter of 2003 (See Note 3, Divestitures.) Excluding
revenue from this subsidiary, revenue increased
$277 million primarily due to an increase in Surface
Transportation revenue.

Operating Income

Operating income for the year ended December 26, 2003 was
down $499 million to $520 million, compared to
$1.0 billion in the prior year. The prior year included
$38 million of operating income of CSX Lines, which was
conveyed to a new venture formed with the Carlyle Group in the
first quarter of 2003. Excluding operating income from this
subsidiary, 2003 operating income decreased $461 million.

The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of two
charges taken during 2003 totaling $340 million. The
Company recorded a $232 million charge in conjunction with
the change in estimate for casualty reserves, which is reflected
in operating expense as “Provision for Casualty
Claims” (See Note  11, Casualty, Environmental
and Other Reserves.) Also, CSX entered into two settlement
agreements, which together resolved all material outstanding
disputes with Maersk. This decreased the Company’s
operating income by $108 million, and is reflected in
operating expense



as the additional loss on sale of international
container-shipping assets. (See Note 19, Commitments and
Contingencies.)

The Company also recorded $34 million pretax as the initial
charge for separation expenses related to the management
restructuring announced in November 2003. In addition, the
Company recorded a credit of $22 million pretax related to
revised estimates for railroad retirement taxes and the amount
of benefits that will ultimately be paid to individuals under
the $1.3 billion charges for separation plans initially
recorded in 1991 and 1992. For the year, the Company recorded a
net restructuring charge of $22 million. (See Note 5,
Management Restructuring.)

In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its interest in its
domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines LLC. The
Consolidated Income Statement includes operating income of
$1 million for the fiscal year ended December 26,
2003, derived from CSX Lines.

Other Income

Other income increased $15 million to $93 million for
the year ended December 26, 2003, compared to
$78 million for the prior year. A decrease in discounts on
sales of accounts receivable due to the discontinuance of the
receivable sale program and a loss on sale in 2002 that did not
recur in 2003 had a favorable impact, but were partially offset
by lower interest income and reduced real estate gains.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $27 million for the year ended
December 26, 2003 as compared to the prior year. Lower
interest rates on floating rate debt and the favorable impact of
interest rate swaps (see Note 13, Derivative Financial
Instruments) continued to benefit the Company.

Net Earnings

Earnings from Continuing Operations were $137 million, or
63 cents per diluted share, for the year ended December 26,
2003 compared to $410 million, or $1.85 per diluted
share for the prior year. The $273 million year-over-year
decrease in Earnings from Continuing Operations primarily
results from a $145 million after-tax charge to increase
the Company’s provision for casualty reserves, a
$67 million after-tax charge to record the loss on sale of
international container-shipping assets and a $21 million
after-tax charge to record amounts associated with the
management restructuring.

Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, were
$52 million, or 23 cents per diluted share, for the year
ended December 26, 2003 compared to earnings of
$57 million, or 25 cents per diluted share for the prior
year.

The year ended December 26, 2003 included an after-tax
cumulative effect of accounting change benefit of
$57 million, related to the adoption of SFAS 143,
while the year ended December 27, 2002, included an
after-tax cumulative effect of accounting change charge of
$43 million, related to the adoption of SFAS 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Net earnings were $246 million, or $1.11 per diluted
share, for the year ended December 26, 2003, compared to
$424 million or $1.91 per diluted share for the prior
year.

The 2003 effective income tax rate was lower than the 2002
effective income tax rate because equity in Conrail earnings
represented a larger percentage of pretax earnings in 2003 than
2002. Also, 2003 included a favorable state income tax benefit
attributable to changes in the Company’s deferred effective
state income tax rate.

Earnings per share, assuming dilution, have been restated for
all periods presented.

expense by segment:



The following tables provide carload and revenue data by
business segment, service group and commodity:

Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2004,
    December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002

(a) Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation.

Rail

2004 vs. 2003

CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal
year 2004 consisted of a 53-week year ending on
December 31, 2004. Fiscal year 2003 consisted of
52 weeks ending on December 26, 2003.

Operating Revenue

CSX categorizes revenues in three main areas: merchandise,
automotive and coal, coke and iron ore. Overall revenues were up
$512 million to $6.7 billion in 2004 from
$6.2 billion in 2003.



Merchandise Revenue

Merchandise showed strength during 2004 with revenue up 8% on 3%
volume growth. All markets showed year-over-year revenue
improvement due to pricing, yield management strategies and the
Company’s fuel surcharge program. All markets, except
agricultural products, experienced increased volumes. Metals
realized the most improvement, with 17% revenue growth on 9%
volume growth. Strong demand existed across all steel commodity
lines as steel production and mill utilization rates were at
high levels. Forest products revenue grew 9% on 1% volume growth
as a result of strength in panel and lumber markets driven by
strong residential construction. Food and consumer revenues grew
7% on 1% volume growth. Food and consumer and forest products
volumes were favorable year-over-year primarily due to the
53 week fiscal reporting calendar in 2004. Chemicals
revenue grew 8% on 4% volume growth driven by strong customer
demand and a rebound in U.S. chemical exports. Emerging
markets revenues grew 7% on 6% volume growth, largely driven by
strength in aggregates, cement, lime and fly ash. New industrial
development is helping serve off–rail markets. Phosphate
and fertilizer revenues grew 4% on 2% volume growth. Fertilizer
production levels were mixed as high fertilizer prices and
hurricane disruptions caused curtailments in production.
Although ethanol shipments contributed to growth in agricultural
products, revenue increased 3% on declining volume due to a
decline in export and bean markets.

Automotive Revenue

Volumes declined largely due to a 100,000 unit
year-over-year decrease in North American light vehicle
production. Downtime at CSXT-served plants also contributed to
volume weakness. Price increases drove improvements in
revenue-per-car.

Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Revenue

Coal, coke and iron ore revenue increased 11% on 6% volume
growth. All lines of business reflect year-over-year
revenue-per-car improvements. Volume growth was driven by gains
in export, metallurgical and utility markets. Strength in
exports was due to high demand primarily related to Asia steel
market needs.

Other

Other revenue for the fiscal year 2004 includes $63 million
for FRT, a short-line railroad consolidated in 2004 pursuant to
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities”. Prior to 2004, FRT was accounted for
under the equity method.

Operating Expense

Total rail operating expenses increased $212 million, or 4%
for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to 2003.

Labor and fringe expense increased $143 million or 6%
compared to the prior year primarily attributable to the effects
of inflation, consolidation of FRT and increases in the
Company’s incentive compensation plan and pension costs.
These costs were partially offset by benefits realized from
reduced staffing levels.

Materials, supplies and other expenses increased
$179 million, or 13%, year-over-year primarily due to
increased maintenance and crew travel costs, property and sales
taxes, coupled with higher track, locomotive, car repair and
other costs. Additionally, due to the adoption of SFAS 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” as
discussed below, depreciation expense has been decreased and
materials, supplies and other expense increased to account for
the discontinuation of the accrual of cross-tie removal as a
component of depreciation expense.



Conrail rents, fees & services expense decreased
$86 million or 25% in 2004, compared to the prior year, as
a result of the Conrail spin-off transaction, which decreased
rents paid to Conrail as assets previously leased from Conrail
are now owned directly by CSXT. (See Note 2, Investment In
and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail.)

Building and equipment rent remained relatively consistent
year-over-year with the slight increase in 2004 resulting from
unfavorable asset utilization.

Inland transportation, which represents CSXI’s use of the
CSXT rail network, increased $22 million or 6%
year-over-year. The offsetting expense associated with this
amount is reflected in CSXI’s operating expense, and thus
eliminates at the consolidated level.

Depreciation expense increased $85 million or 15% compared
to the prior year primarily attributable to the Conrail spin-off
transaction. The rail segment had property additions of
approximately $1 billion, but the additional depreciation
was offset by the reduction in depreciation associated with the
adoption of SFAS 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.” In conjunction with the group-life method of
accounting for asset costs, the Company historically accrued
crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation, which is
not permitted under SFAS 143. The effect is to decrease
depreciation expense and increase material, supplies and other
expense.

Fuel expense increased $90 million or 16% in 2004, net of
$63 million of fuel hedging benefits, compared to the prior
year primarily due to fuel price increases, while increased
volumes were also a factor. The average price per gallon of
diesel fuel, including benefits from CSX’s fuel hedging
program, was $1.0950 in 2004 versus $0.9564 in 2003. In
addition, the fuel surcharge programs and contractual cost
escalation clauses used in most multi-year customer contracts
partially offset fuel cost increases.

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, the rail
business segment recorded expense of $67 million for
separation expense, pension and post-retirement benefit
curtailment charges, stock compensation expense and other
related expenses. (See Note 5, Management Restructuring.)

Rail operating expense for the fiscal year ended
December 26, 2003, included a charge of $229 million
recorded in conjunction with the Company’s change in
estimate for its casualty reserves to include an estimate of
incurred but not reported claims for asbestos and other
occupational injuries that could be received over the next seven
years. This charge is reflected as “Provision for Casualty
Claims” in the operating expense detail above. (See
Note 11, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves.)

Operating Income

Operating income increased $300 million to
$841 million in 2004, compared to $541 million in 2003
primarily due to an 8% increase in revenue coupled with the
absence of $229 million provision for casualty claims,
offset by $67 million of management restructuring charges
and other expense increases as previously discussed.

2003 vs. 2002

Operating Revenue

Overall rail revenues increased $179 million to
$6.2 billion in 2003, with increases in merchandise and
automotive revenues.

Merchandise Revenue

Merchandise showed strength during 2003 with revenue up 5% on 4%
volume growth. All markets showed year-over-year revenue
improvement, and all except phosphates and fertilizers
experienced increased volumes. Emerging markets realized the
most improvement, with 18%



revenue growth on 12% volume growth. Aggregates and cement
traffic grew faster than average industry growth rates due to
new industrial development and increased conversion of truck
traffic to rail. Ammunition volumes increased throughout the
year and strength continued in waste markets. The metals sector
also showed strength in 2003. Revenue improved 8% on 9% volume
growth, driven by strong global steel demand, particularly for
scrap and sheet steel. Other factors contributing to improvement
include strength in semi-finish metals and continued increases
in modal conversions. Demand for building products, lumber and
paper products resulted in an increase in forest and industrial
revenue of 5% on 2% volume growth. The agricultural and food and
chemical sectors also realized revenue increases, while volumes
remained consistent with 2002. Phosphates and fertilizers
revenues increased slightly year-over-year despite decreased
volume, due to domestic phosphates and ammonia strength.

Automotive Revenue

Volume declined largely due to a 200,000 unit
year-over-year decrease in North American light vehicle
production. Haul extensions and price increases drove
improvements in revenue-per-car.

Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Revenue

Coal, coke and iron ore volumes and revenue remained consistent
with results in the prior year. Export moves were strong due to
high European steam coal demand for electricity generation.
Steel related traffic was weak throughout the year, but showed
renewed strength during the fourth quarter due to consolidation
in the steel industry and shifts in scrap metal demands that
resulted in increased traffic and revenue for CSX. Utility
revenue was favorable due to pricing initiatives and higher
average length of haul. Improvements in these areas were offset
by abnormally harsh winter weather during the first quarter
which adversely affected lake loadings, as lakes were frozen.

Operating Expense

Total rail operating expenses increased $492 million, or
10% in 2003 as compared to 2002. Increases in most expense
categories were somewhat offset by decreases in building and
equipment rent.

The primary component of the expense increase was a charge of
$229 million recorded in conjunction with the
Company’s change in estimate for its casualty reserves to
include an estimate of incurred but not reported claims for
asbestos and other occupational injuries that could be received
over the next seven years. This charge is reflected as
“Provision for Casualty Claims” in the operating
expense detail above. (See Note 11, Casualty, Environmental
and Other Reserves.)

Labor and fringe expense remained relatively consistent
year-over-year. The cost of labor inflation was offset by
December-over-December reductions in staff of approximately
1,200 and the favorable impact of the absence of a management
bonus in 2003, as approximately $45 million of such expense
was recorded in 2002.

Materials, supplies and other expense increased
$117 million, or 10%, year-over-year. One of the primary
drivers was approximately $80 million of increased cost for
personal injury and related safety issues. An additional
$20 million of the expense deterioration is due to
increased cost of derailments. Additionally, due to the adoption
of SFAS 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” as discussed below, depreciation expense has
been decreased and materials, supplies and other expense
increased to account for the discontinuation of the accrual of
cross-tie removal as a component of depreciation expense. The
remaining increase results from volume increases, inflationary
effects and general operational inefficiencies.

Conrail rents, fees & services expense increased
$20 million in 2003, as compared to the prior year, as a
result of increased usage of Shared Assets Areas, a contractual
increase in the rental fee



for Shared Area facilities, and a favorable tax adjustment in
the prior year. (See Note 2, Investment In and Integrated
Rail Operations with Conrail.)

Building and equipment rent decreased $7 million in 2003
compared to the prior year principally as a result of reduced
car rentals from other railroads.

Inland transportation, which represents CSXI’s use of the
CSXT rail network, remained relatively consistent
year-over-year. The offsetting expense associated with this
amount is reflected in CSXI’s operating expense, and thus
eliminates on a Surface Transportation level.

Depreciation remained consistent year-over-year. The rail
segment had capital additions of approximately $1 billion,
but the additional depreciation was offset by the reduction in
depreciation associated with the adoption of SFAS 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” In
conjunction with the group-life method of accounting for asset
costs, the Company historically accrued crosstie removal costs
as a component of depreciation, which is not permitted under
SFAS 143. The effect is to decrease depreciation expense
and increase materials, supplies and other expense.

Fuel expense increased $117 million in 2003, as compared to
the prior year. The expense increase is primarily due to
$102 million in fuel price increases, while increased
volumes were also a factor. The average price per gallon of fuel
was 96 cents per gallon for 2003 compared to 78 cents per gallon
for 2002. In order to minimize future exposure to fuel price
fluctuation risk, during 2003 the Company entered into a series
of swaps in order to fix the price of a portion of its estimated
future fuel purchases. As of December 26, 2003, 18% and 21%
of 2004 and 2005, respectively, estimated fuel purchases were
hedged. Fuel swaps did not have an effect on fuel expense for
the year ended December 26, 2003.

The net $22 million restructuring charge in 2003 represents
the cost of CSX’s reorganization charges offset by
reductions in 1991/1992 separation reserves. (See Note 5,
Management Restructuring.)

Operating Income

Operating income decreased $313 million to
$541 million in 2003, compared to $854 million in 2002
primarily due to the $229 million provision for casualty
claims, the $22 million net restructuring charge and other
expense increases as previously discussed. Excluding the
provision for casualty claims and net restructuring charge,
operating income would have been $792 million.

Intermodal

CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal
year 2004 consisted of a 53-week year ending on
December 31, 2004. Fiscal year 2003 consisted of
52 weeks ending on December 26, 2003.

2004 vs. 2003

CSXI revenue improved 5% on a 3% volume increase due to strength
in most business commodities. Strong gains in truck brokerage
continued with the implementation of deal space technology,
which is incorporated into the broader Pegasus system. Deal
space technology is designed as a pricing, scheduling and
capacity reservation system and provides CSX Trucking Solicitors
real-time information on costs, competitive prices, preferred
routes and service. The parcel and international sectors also
continued to show year-over-year strength. The parcel group
showed improvement in most markets while international volume
gains were based on general import growth. The domestic channel
did not experience year-over-year growth due to CSXI’s
Network Simplification Initiative which led to overall service
improvements across the network, limited some terminals to
containers only and improved the profitability of the traffic.



CSXI operating expense increased $27 million compared to
the prior year due primarily to increases in volume and
inflationary factors. Operating income increased to
$152 million in 2004, compared to $110 million in the
prior year, for a 38% improvement.

2003 vs. 2002

CSXI domestic revenue improved 13% on 8% volume increase due to
increased unloading and loading (“transloading”) of
international containers into domestic containers and new
programs. Strength in truck brokerage continued due to the
rollout of the new Pegasus information management system, which
provides real-time information regarding driver availability and
location, service quality tracking and financial performance.
The parcel sector also showed year-over-year strength.
International strength in general import growth was partially
offset by continued international import/export diversions of
freight carried entirely via water routes from west coast ports
to east coast ports. These diversions have resulted in volume
declines, shorter hauls and lower per-unit revenue.

CSXI operating expense increased $108 million compared to
the prior year. The increase is due primarily to traffic mix and
inflationary factors. Additionally, the Company recognized a
$15 million positive contract settlement in 2002. Operating
income decreased to $110 million in 2003, compared to
$141 million in the prior year.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Operating Activities

Cash provided by operations in 2004 was $1.4 billion,
compared to $804 million for 2003. In 2003, CSX
discontinued the receivable sale program decreasing cash
provided by operating activities by $380 million as the Company
repurchased those receivables. Federal income tax payments were
significantly lower in 2004 compared to the prior year resulting
in additional cash from operating activities of $99 million.
Finally, 2003 cash flows from operations includes payment of
2002 management incentive compensation, whereas the Company did
not make such a payment in 2004.

Investing Activities

Net cash used by investing activities was $1.2 billion in
2004 compared to $807 million in 2003. Property additions
totaled $1.0 billion in 2003 and 2004.

Financing Activities

Financing activities provided cash of $20 million during
2004 compared to $172 million in 2003.

The weighted average interest rate on outstanding short-term
borrowings of $101 million was 1.1% as of December 31,
2004. The Company had $2 million of short-term borrowings
outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1.21% as of
December 26, 2003.

Debt Issuances

In February 2004, the Company executed a $100 million bank
financing that matures February 25, 2005, which bore
interest at a rate that varied with LIBOR plus an applicable
spread. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had
$100 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding
under this agreement. The Company settled this obligation with
cash at maturity.

In June 2004, the Company executed a $300 million bank
financing with a maturity date of December 29, 2004, which
bore interest at a rate that varied with LIBOR plus an
applicable spread.



As of December 31, 2004, the Company had repaid the entire
aggregate principal amount outstanding under this agreement and
terminated this agreement.

In August 2004, the Company issued $300 million of floating
rate notes with a maturity date of August 3, 2006. The
notes bear interest at a rate that varies with LIBOR plus an
applicable spread. These notes are not redeemable prior to
maturity.

In August 2003, the Company issued $300 million aggregate
principal amount of the Company’s Notes due 2013. These
Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.50% and mature on
August 1, 2013. The Notes may be redeemed by the Company at
any time.

In November 2003, CSX issued $200 million aggregate
principal amount of the Company’s Notes due 2014 and
$200 million aggregate principal amount of the
Company’s Notes due 2006. The 2014 Notes bear interest at
the rate of 5.30% per year and mature on February 15,
2014. The 2006 Notes bear interest at the rate of 2.75% per
year and mature on February 15, 2006. The Company may
redeem the 2014 Notes at any time, but the 2006 Notes cannot be
redeemed before maturity.

In December 2003, CSX executed a $75 million revolving loan
facility with a maturity date in 2005. Borrowings under the
facility bore interest at a rate that fluctuated with LIBOR. In
addition, the Company paid an annual commitment fee of 0.15% for
the period the facility was not drawn. This debt was redeemable
at any time after May 2004, with additional borrowings allowed
through the maturity of the facility. As of December 31,
2004, the Company had $75 million in aggregate principal
amount outstanding under this borrowing. In January 2005, the
Company paid this obligation in full with cash.

Debt Repayments

CSX repaid long-term debt of $434 million in 2004 compared
to $500 million in 2003, including outstanding debt
obligations of $300 million that matured in August 2004.
The primary sources of 2004 debt repayments were the issuance of
new debt combined with cash on hand.

The Company also paid a net $141 million in short-term debt
during 2003. The primary sources of 2003 repayments were the
$214 million of proceeds from the conveyance of CSX Lines
(see Note 3, Divestitures) and the issuance of new debt.

Long-term and short-term debt at December 31, 2004 and
December 26, 2003, totaled $7.2 billion and
$7.3 billion, respectively. The ratio of debt to total
capitalization was 48% and 51% at December 31, 2004 and
December 26, 2003, respectively.

Working Capital

The Company’s working capital deficit at December 31,
2004, was $330 million, as compared to $77 million at
December 26, 2003. A working capital deficit is not unusual
for the Company and other companies in the industry and does not
indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain
adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and
maturing obligations when they



come due and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its
day-to-day cash requirements and any obligations arising from
legal, tax and other regulatory rulings.

Credit Facilities

The Company has a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured
revolving credit facility expiring in May 2009 and a
$400 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility
expiring in May 2005. The facilities were entered into in May
2004 on terms substantially similar to the facilities they
replaced: a $345 million unsecured revolving credit
facility that expired in May 2004 and a $1.0 billion
unsecured revolving credit facility that would have expired in
May 2006. Generally, these facilities may be used for general
corporate purposes, to support the Company’s commercial
paper, and for working capital. Neither of the credit facilities
was drawn on as of December 31, 2004. Commitment fees and
interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees
and rates available to comparably rated investment-grade
borrowers. Similar to the credit facilities they replaced, these
credit facilities allow for borrowings at floating (LIBOR-based)
rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt
ratings. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with all covenant requirements under the facilities.

Credit Ratings

As of December 31, 2004, CSX’s long-term unsecured
debt obligations were rated BBB and Baa2 by Standard and
Poor’s and Moody’s Investor Service, respectively. On
March 30, 2004, Standard and Poor’s lowered the
Company’s short-term rating from A-2 to A-3 and revised the
outlook from stable to negative. On July 6, 2004,
Moody’s Investor Service reaffirmed the Company’s
short and long-term unsecured debt ratings, but adjusted the
outlook from stable to negative. The Company’s short-term
commercial paper program is rated A-3 and P-2 by Standard and
Poor’s and Moody’s Investor Service, respectively.
This increases the Company’s borrowing costs in the
commercial paper market and reduces the Company’s access to
these funds because of the limited demand for A-3 commercial
paper. If CSX’s long-term unsecured bond ratings were
reduced to BBB- and Baa3, the Company’s undrawn borrowing
costs under the $1.2 billion and $400 million
revolving credit facilities would not materially increase.

Shelf Registration Statements

CSX currently has $900 million of capacity under an
effective shelf registration that may be used, subject to market
conditions and board authorization, to issue debt or equity
securities at the Company’s discretion. The Company
presently intends to use the proceeds from the sale of any
securities issued under its shelf registration statement to
finance cash requirements, including refinancing existing debt
as it matures. While the Company seeks to give itself
flexibility with respect to meeting such needs, there can be no
assurance that market conditions would permit the Company to
sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or
at all.

Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail

See background, accounting and financial reporting effects and
summary financial information in Note 2, Investment In and
Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail.



Critical Accounting
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts
of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those
estimates. Significant estimates using management judgment are
made for the following areas:

These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis.

Casualty, Environmental, and Legal Reserves

Casualty Reserves

Casualty reserves represent accruals for the uninsured portion
of personal injury and occupational injury claims.

Personal Injury

In 2003, CSX retained an independent actuarial firm to assist
management in assessing the value of CSX’s personal injury
portfolio. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial
firm semi-annually. The methodology used by the actuary includes
a development factor to reflect growth in the value of the
Company’s personal injury claims. This methodology is based
largely on CSX’s historical claims and settlement activity.
Actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and
severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments, and
uncertainties surrounding the litigation process. In conjunction
with the change in estimate during the third quarter of 2003,
the Company recorded a charge of $26 million for personal
injury liabilities. Reserves for personal injury claims are
$383 million and $355 million at December 31,
2004 and December 26, 2003, respectively.

While the final outcome of casualty-related matters cannot be
predicted with certainty, considering among other things the
meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have
been recorded, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of
these items, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position or liquidity.
However, should a number of these items occur in the same
period, it could have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year.

Occupational

Occupational claims include allegations of exposure to certain
materials in the work place, such as asbestos, solvents, and
diesel fuel, or alleged physical injuries, such as carpal tunnel
syndrome or hearing loss.

Asbestos

The Company is party to a number of occupational claims by
employees exposed to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest
exposure for CSX employees was due to work conducted in and
around the use of steam locomotive engines that were phased out
between the early 1950’s and late 1960’s. However,
other types of exposures, including exposure from locomotive
component parts and building materials, continued after 1967,
until it was substantially eliminated by 1985.



Asbestos claim filings against the Company have been
inconsistent. Accordingly, while the Company had concluded that
a probable loss had occurred, it did not believe it could
estimate the range of reasonably possible loss because of the
lack of experience with such claims and the lack of detailed
employment records for the population of exposed employees.
Claim filings increased and when they continued into 2003, the
Company concluded that an estimate for incurred but not reported
asbestos exposure liability needed to be recorded.

In 2003, CSX engaged a third party, who has extensive experience
in performing asbestos and other occupational studies, to assist
in assessing the unasserted liability exposure. The objective of
the assessment was to determine the number of estimated incurred
but not reported asbestos claims and the estimated average cost
per claim to be received over the next seven years. Seven years
was determined by management to be the time period in which
claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more
certainty.

The Company, with the assistance of the third party, first
determined its exposed population from which it was able to
derive the estimated number of incurred but not reported claims.
The estimated average cost per claim was then determined
utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data. Based on
the assessment, in September 2003 the Company recorded an
undiscounted $141 million pre-tax charge for unasserted
asbestos claims. Key elements of the assessment included the
following:

From these assumptions CSX projected the incidence of each type
of disease to the estimated population to arrive at an estimate
of the total number of employees that could potentially assert a
claim. Historical claim filing rates were applied for each type
of disease to the total number of employees that could
potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of
anticipated claim filings by disease type. Historical dismissal
rates, which represent claims that are closed without payment,
were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by
disease type that would likely require payment by the Company.
Finally, the number of such claims was multiplied by the average
settlement value to estimate CSX’s future liability for
incurred but not reported asbestos claims.

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim
values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve.
Asbestos claim filings are typically sporadic and may include
large batches of claims solicited by law firms. To reflect these
factors, CSX used a two-year calibration period during its
initial assessment because the Company believed it would be most
representative of its future claim experience. In addition, for
non-malignant claims, the number of future claims to be filed
against CSX declines at a rate consistent with both mortality
and age as there is a decreasing probability of filing claims as
the population ages. CSX believes the average claim values



by type of disease from the historical period 2001-2002 are most
representative of future claim values. Non-malignant claims,
which represent approximately 90% of the total number and 91% of
the cost of estimated future asbestos claims, were valued by age
of the projected claimants. Historically, the ultimate
settlement value of these types of claims is most sensitive to
the age of the claimant. A 10% increase or decrease in either
the forecasted number of incurred but not reported claims or the
average claim values would result in an approximate
$14 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded
for unasserted asbestos claims.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, management updated their
assessment of the unasserted liability exposure with the
assistance of the third party specialists. In 2004, individual
asbestos claims continued to be sporadic and proved to be
submitted at a low rate for the year. In further review of the
data, the bulk claims filed by the law firms appear to be filed
against the Company every other year. As a result, management
reassessed the calibration period to a 4-year average
(2000-2004) to capture the most recent filing experience within
the context of the bulk law firm filings.

CSX will obtain semi-annual updates of the study. On a quarterly
basis, CSX will monitor actual experience against the number of
forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments.
Adjustments to our estimates will be recorded quarterly if
necessary. More periodic updates to the study will occur if
trends necessitate a change. At December 31, 2004, the
Company had recorded undiscounted liabilities of
$212 million for asbestos-related claims. Of the amount
recorded, $132 million is related to incurred but not
reported claims while $80 million is related to asserted
claims. As of December 26, 2003, the Company had recorded
undiscounted liabilities of $246 for asbestos-related claims.
Current liabilities include $37 million and
$20 million of asbestos-related claims as of
December 31, 2004 and December 26, 2003, respectively.
Defense and processing costs, which historically have been and
are anticipated in the future to be insignificant, are not
included in the recorded liability. The Company is presently
self-insured for asbestos-related claims.

Other Occupational

In the third quarter of 2003, the Company changed its estimate
of occupational reserves to include an estimate of incurred but
not reported claims for other occupational injuries as well as
asbestos as noted above. The Company engaged a third party
specialist to assist in projecting the number of other
occupational injury claims to be received over the next seven
years and the related costs. Based on this analysis, the Company
established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable
other occupational injury liabilities. In the third quarter of
2003, the Company recorded an undiscounted $65 million
pre-tax charge for incurred but not reported other occupational
claims for similar reasons as asbestos discussed above. Similar
to the asbestos liability estimation process, the key elements
of the assessment included the following:

•

An estimate of the potentially exposed population for other
    occupational diseases was calculated by projecting active versus
    retired work force from 2002 to 2010 using a growth rate
    projection for overall railroad employment made by the Railroad
    Retirement Board in its June 2003 report.

•

An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type
    of injury, employee type, and active versus retired employee was
    computed using the Company’s average historical claim
    filing rates for the calibration period 2002-2003 for all
    diseases except hearing loss. Because the filing rate for
    hearing loss claims has been decreasing since 1998, the latest
    year filing of 2003 was used. These calibration periods are the
    time periods which management felt were representative of future
    filing rates. An estimate was made to forecast future claims by
    using the filing rates by disease and the active and retired CSX
    population each year.

•

An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of
    injury was computed using the Company’s historical average
    of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using
    the average settlement by type of injury observed during
    2001-2003.



At December 31, 2004, the Company had recorded undiscounted
liabilities of $110 million for other occupational-related
claims. Of the amount recorded, $56 million is related to
incurred but not reported claims while $54 million is
related to asserted claims. As of December 26, 2003, the
Company had recorded undiscounted liabilities of
$111 million for other occupational-related claims. Current
liabilities include $18 million and $4 million at
December 31, 2004 and December 26, 2003, respectively.
Defense and processing costs, which historically have been and
are anticipated in the future to be insignificant, are not
included in the recorded liability. The Company is presently
self-insured for other occupational-related claims.

The amounts recorded by CSX for the occupational liability were
based upon currently known facts. Projecting future events, such
as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average
cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous
uncertainties surrounding asbestos and other occupational
litigation in the United States, could cause the actual costs to
be higher or lower than projected.

Environmental Reserves

CSXT is a party to various proceedings, including administrative
and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and
regulatory agencies related to environmental issues. CSXT has
been identified as a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) at approximately 252 environmentally impaired
sites, many of which are, or may be, subject to remedial action
under the Federal Superfund statute (“Superfund”) or
similar state statutes. A number of these proceedings are based
on allegations that CSXT, or its railroad predecessors, sent
hazardous substances to the facilities in question for disposal.
Some of the proceedings involve property formerly or currently
owned by CSXT or its railroad predecessors. Proceedings arising
under Superfund or similar state statutes can involve numerous
other companies who generated the waste or owned or operated the
property and involve the allocation of liability for costs
associated with site investigation and cleanup, which could be
substantial.

At least once each quarter, CSXT reviews its role with respect
to each such location, giving consideration to a number of
factors, including:

CSXT management estimates its environmental liabilities using
guidance from

Statement of Position 96-1, Environmental
Remediation Liabilities.

Each site is periodically evaluated
and the liability is adjusted to the most recent estimates made
by management. Based on this review process, CSXT has recorded
reserves to cover estimated contingent future environmental
costs with respect to such sites. These liabilities, which are
undiscounted, include amounts representing CSXT’s estimate
of unasserted claims, which CSXT believes to be immaterial. The
liability includes future costs for all sites where the
Company’s obligation is (1) deemed probable, and
(2) can be reasonably estimated. The liability includes
future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as
any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any
anticipated insurance recoveries.

The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to
reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if
any, on some sites until completion of future environmental
studies. Also, changes in federal and state laws and regulations
may impact, favorably or unfavora-



bly, the effort required to remediate sites. In addition, latent
conditions at any given location could result in exposure, the
amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably
estimated. Based upon information currently available, however,
the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to
accomplish remedial actions to comply with present laws and
regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters,
if any, will not materially affect its overall results of
operations and financial condition.

Legal Reserves

In accordance with SFAS 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies,” an accrual for a loss contingency is
established if information available prior to issuance of the
financial statements indicates that it is (1) probable that
an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at
the date of the financial statements, and (2) the amount of
loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a
loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not
met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount
accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at
least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss
may have been incurred.

The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal
liabilities twice quarterly and records and adjusts reserves
when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a
particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include
official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or
changes in laws, regulations, and evidentiary standards.

Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Accounting

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans, principally
for salaried, non-contract personnel. The plans provide eligible
employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years
of service and compensation rates near retirement. In addition
to the defined benefit pension plans, the Company sponsors one
medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits
to full-time, salaried, non-contract employees hired prior to
January  1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain
eligibility requirements are met. The postretirement medical
plans are contributory (partially funded by retirees), with
retiree contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan
is non-contributory.

The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance
provided in SFAS No. 87, “Employers Accounting
for Pensions,” and SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other than Pensions.” Both of these statements require that
management make certain assumptions relating to the following:

These assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the
year. As permitted by SFAS 87, the Company has elected to
use a plan fiscal year of October 1 through
September 30 to actuarially value its pension and
postretirement plans as it provides for more timely analysis.
The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute
the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans
subject to the assumptions that the Company selects as of the
beginning of the plan year. The Company reviews the discount,
salary scale inflation, and health care cost trend rates on an
annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on
current rates and trends as appropriate. Since the Company
negatively adjusted its expected long-term rate of return on
assets in both 2004 and 2005, management does not anticipate
revisiting this rate for the next 3 to 5 years to maintain
consistency with market cycles.



Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects
the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or
to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected
benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives
appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the
plan assets in the fund and the rates of return expected to be
available for reinvestment. The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets is used in conjunction with the
market-related value of assets to compute the expected return on
assets.

The Company’s expected long-term average rate of return on
assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the
funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from
various investment managers and economists with both market and
actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate
of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this
assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than
other assumptions used in pension accounting. However, recent
overall market returns have caused CSX to reevaluate and reduce
the rate used in calculating its liability at September 30,
2004, consequently increasing the amount of pension expense
reported in future periods.

Discount Rates

Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the
interest expense component of pension and postretirement
expense. Assumed discount rates reflect the rates at which the
pension benefits could be effectively settled. It is appropriate
in estimating those rates to look to available information about
rates implicit in current prices of annuity contracts that could
be used to effect settlement of the obligation. In making those
estimates, employers may also look to rates of return on
high-quality fixed-income investments currently available and
expected to be available during the period to maturity of the
pension benefits. Each year those rates are reevaluated to
determine whether they reflect the best estimate of the current
effective settlement rates. If interest rates generally decline
or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.

The Company derives its discount rates from composite yields of
AA-rated bonds adjusted for estimated durations. The difference
between the discount rate used for pension and that used for
postretirement is due to the different time horizon of future
payments. Consequently, management has minimal discretion with
respect to the discount rates selected.

Salary Scale Inflation

Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and
historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews
recent merit increases and management incentive compensation
payments over the past five years in assessment of salary scale
inflation rates.

Health Care Cost Trend Rates

Health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience
and industry trends. The Company uses actuarial data to
substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs,
representing increases in total plan costs, which include claims
and administrative fee cost components. The current assumed
health care cost trend rate is 11% and is expected to increase
slightly before decreasing gradually until reaching 4.5% in
2013. No changes were deemed necessary to the health care costs
trend rate for the years 2003 or 2004. Due to the increasing
costs of providing health benefits, the Company expects to
increase the inflation assumption for health care costs for 2005.



Other Assumptions

The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions
relating to mortality rates, turnover, and retirement age. These
assumptions are based on historical data and are approved by
management.

2005 Estimated Pension and Postretirement Expense

As a result of changes in assumptions for fiscal year 2005, net
periodic pension benefit cost and postretirement benefit costs
for 2005 are expected to be approximately $47 million and
$40 million, respectively. It is not likely that an event
will occur in 2005 to cause the Company to adjust the discount
rate or salary scale inflation rate in excess of 0.25%.

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
    of 2003

The Company is required to estimate and record the effects of
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 (“Act”). The Company believes that a
portion of its medical plan’s prescription drug benefit
will qualify as actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D
based upon a review by the plan’s health and welfare
actuary of the plan’s prescription drug benefit compared
with the prescription drug benefit that would be paid under
Medicare Part D beginning in 2006. The reduction in the
postretirement benefit obligation as a result of the Act was
approximately $25 million. There was no immediate impact on
net earnings as an unrecognized gain will be recorded. The
effects of the Act are reflected in net postretirement benefit
costs as the unrecognized gain is amortized, which began in the
second quarter of 2004. Postretirement benefit costs were
reduced by approximately $3 million in 2004 due to the Act.
(See Note 18, Employee Benefit Plans.)

Depreciation Policies for Assets Under the Group-Life
Method

The Company accounts for its rail assets, including main-line
track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life
method. The group-life method pools similar assets by type and
then depreciates each group as a whole. Under the group-life
method, the service lives for each group of rail assets are
determined by the performance of periodic life studies and
management’s assumptions concerning the service lives of
its properties. These studies are conducted by a third party
expert, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved
by the STB.

Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies
could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation
expense and thus the Company’s results of operations.
Events that could cause the Company to change its estimates
relating to the lives of its asset groups could be



changes in historical results, technological improvements,
maintenance plans and changes in specific assets. The life
studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of
accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the
amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess)
is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the
remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required
life study.

Although recent experience with life studies has resulted in
depreciation rate changes, these modifications have not
significantly affected the Company’s annual depreciation
expense. In 2003, the Company completed life studies for all of
its rail, equipment and track assets, resulting in an increase
in the average useful lives of equipment and track assets, while
decreasing the average useful lives of many roadway assets. The
combination of these adjustments increased depreciation expense
by $1 million in 2003 with a decrease of approximately
$13 million in 2004. Life studies for equipment assets are
completed every three years, whereas road and track life studies
are completed every six years as required by the STB.

Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 95% of
the Company’s total fixed assets and amounted to
$19.3 billion on a net basis at December 31, 2004. The
Company’s depreciation expense for the year ended
December 31, 2004 amounted to $711 million. A
one-percentage point increase (or decrease) in the average life
of all group-life assets would result in a $7 million
increase (or decrease) to the Company’s annual depreciation
expense.

Income Taxes

Management uses factors such as applicable law, current
information and past experience with similar issues in computing
its income tax expense. The Company has not materially changed
its methodology for calculating income tax expense for the years
presented. The Company does not anticipate any material change
in the methodology or assumptions used in determining the
Company’s income tax expense.

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return,
which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations
of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed
through 1993. Federal income tax returns for 1994 through 2003
currently are under examination. Management believes adequate
provision has been made for any adjustments that might be
assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be
predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management
that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on
the results of operations, financial position or liquidity of
CSX. However, an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of
these items could have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. The
Company is party to a number of legal and administrative
proceedings, the resolution of which could result in gain
realization in amounts that could be material to results of
operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year.

Management Restructuring

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk

CSX addresses market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs through the
use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not
hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes.

The Company addresses its exposure to interest rate market risk
through a controlled program of risk management that includes
the use of interest rate swap agreements. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company had various interest rate
swap agreements on $950 million of its fixed rate
outstanding notes payable. In the event of a 1% increase or
decrease in the LIBOR interest rate, the interest expense
related to these agreements would increase or decrease
approximately $10 million on an annual basis.

During 2003, the Company began a program to hedge its exposure
to fuel price volatility through swap transactions. As of
December 31, 2004, CSX had hedged approximately 48% and 9%
of fuel purchases for 2005 and 2006, respectively. At
December 31, 2004, a 1% change in fuel prices would result
in an increase or decrease in the asset related to the swaps of
approximately $4 million. The Company’s rail unit
average annual fuel consumption is approximately
615 million gallons. A one-cent change in the price per
gallon of fuel would affect fuel expense by approximately
$5 million annually.

The Company is exposed to loss in the event of non-performance
by any counter-party to the interest rate swap or fuel hedging
agreements. The Company does not anticipate non-performance by
such counter-parties, and no material loss would be expected
from non-performance.

Exclusive of derivative contracts that swap fixed interest rate
notes to floating interest rates, CSX had approximately
$604 million of floating rate debt outstanding at
December 31, 2004. A 1% variance in interest rates would on
average affect annual interest expense by approximately
$6 million.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of CSX Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
CSX Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004
and December 26, 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows, and changes in
shareholders’ equity for each of the three fiscal years in
the period ended December 31, 2004. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of CSX Corporation and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and December 26,
2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, in 2004 the Company changed its method of
calculating earnings per share, in 2003 the Company changed its
method of accounting for railroad tie removal costs and
stock-based compensation, and in 2002 the Company changed its
method of accounting for indefinite lived intangible assets.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of CSX Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 2, 2005,
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Shareholders and Board of Directors of CSX Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Report of Management on CSX Corporation’s
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under
Item 9A, that CSX Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
CSX Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that CSX
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
opinion, CSX Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
2004 consolidated financial statements of CSX Corporation and
our report dated March 2, 2005, expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to fairly
present the financial position of CSX and subsidiaries at
December 31, 2004 and December 26, 2003, the
Consolidated Income Statements, Cash Flows and Changes in
Shareholders’ Equity for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2004, December 26, 2003 and
December 27, 2002, such adjustments being of a normal
recurring nature. Certain prior-year data have been reclassified
to conform to the 2004 presentation.

Nature of Operations

CSX is a freight transportation company with principal business
units providing rail transportation and intermodal services. The
Company’s international terminals business is reported as
Discontinued Operations for all periods presented.

•

Rail transportation services are provided principally throughout
    the Eastern United States and accounted for 83% of the
    Company’s 2004 operating revenue.

•

Intermodal services are provided through a dedicated network of
    terminals and facilities across North America and accounted for
    17% of operating revenue in 2004.

Rail shipments include merchandise, automotive products and
coal, coke and iron ore. Service groups as a percent of rail
revenue are as follows:

CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include CSX and its
majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in
companies that are not majority-owned are carried at cost (if
less than 20% owned and the Company has no significant
influence) or equity (if the Company has significant influence).

Fiscal Year

CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal
year 2004 consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2003 and 2002
consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002
ended on:

•

December 31, 2004

•

December 26, 2003

•

December 27, 2002

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

On a daily basis, cash in excess of current operating
requirements is invested in various highly liquid investments
having a maturity of three months or less at the date of
acquisition. These investments are carried at cost, which
approximates market value. Investments which the Company
considers to be highly liquid are classified as Cash
Equivalents. Investments in instruments with maturities less
than one year are classified as Short Term Investments.

Materials and Supplies

Materials and supplies consist primarily of fuel and items for
replacement and maintenance of track and equipment, and are
carried at average cost.

Properties

All properties are stated at cost less an allowance for
accumulated depreciation. Rail assets, including main-line
track, locomotives and freight cars are depreciated using the
group-life method, which pools similar assets by road and
equipment type and then depreciates each group as a whole. The
majority of non-rail property is depreciated using the
straight-line method on a per asset basis.

Regulations enforced by the STB of the U.S. Department of
Transportation require periodic formal studies of ultimate
service lives for all railroad assets. Factors taken into
account during the life study include:

The results of the life study process determine the service
lives for each asset group under the group-life method. These
studies are conducted by a third party expert and analyzed by
the Company’s management. Resulting service life estimates
are subject to review and approval by the



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

STB. Road assets, including main-line track, have estimated
service lives ranging from 5 years for system roadway
machinery to 80 years for grading. Equipment assets,
including locomotives and freight cars, have estimated service
lives ranging from 6 years for vehicles to 35 years
for work equipment.

Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies
are applied at the completion of the life study and continue
until the next required life study. The life studies may also
indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is
deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study.
Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of
depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset
group until the next required life study.

For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that
occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset cost (net of
salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated
depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. For retirements
or disposals of non-rail depreciable assets, infrequent disposal
of rail assets outside the normal course of business and all
dispositions of land, the resulting gains or losses are
recognized at the time of disposal. Expenditures that
significantly increase asset values or extend useful lives are
capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to
operating expense when the work is performed.

Properties and other long-lived assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or business conditions indicate the
carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
Initial assessments of recoverability are based on estimates of
undiscounted future net cash flows associated with an asset or a
group of assets in accordance with SFAS 144. Where
impairment is indicated, the assets are evaluated, and their
carrying amount is reduced to fair value based on undiscounted
net cash flows or other estimates of fair value.

Revenue and Expense Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue using Free-On-Board
(“FOB”) Origin pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) 1991-9

Revenue and Expense Recognition for
Freight Services in Process.

The Company uses method
(5) in the EITF, which provides for the allocation of
revenue between reporting periods based on relative transit time
in each reporting period. Expenses are recognized as incurred.

Four key estimates are included in the recognition and
measurement of revenue and related accounts receivable under the
policies described above:

The Company regularly updates the estimates described above
based on historical experience.

Prior to the conveyance of CSX Lines in 2003, container-shipping
revenue, and a corresponding accrual for the estimated cost to
complete delivery, was recorded when cargo first sailed from its
port of origin. International Terminals revenue and expense are
recognized when vessels depart from the terminal.

All other revenue is recorded upon completion of service.



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting
for share-based payments effective fiscal year 2003 using the
prospective method described in FASB Statement No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure” and accordingly, expense of
$11 million and $5 million was recognized in fiscal
years ended December 31, 2004, and December 26, 2003,
respectively, for stock options granted in May 2003. Stock
compensation expense for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2004 includes $5 million recorded in conjunction with the
Company’s management restructuring (see Note 5,
Management Restructuring), related to recognition of unamortized
expense for 2003 stock option awards retained by terminated
employees. In addition to stock option expense, stock-based
employee compensation expense included in reported net income
consists of restricted stock awards and stock issued to
directors for all period presented.

The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net
earnings and earnings per share as if the fair value based
method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards
in each period:

As discussed in “New Accounting Pronouncements and Change
in Accounting Policy” below, the Company will comply with
SFAS 123®, “Share-Based Payment”, effective
July 1, 2005.

Comprehensive Earnings

CSX reports comprehensive earnings (loss) in accordance with
SFAS 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” in
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’
Equity. Comprehensive earnings are defined as all changes in
shareholders’ equity during a period, other than those
resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders
(i.e. issuance of equity securities and dividends). Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Loss at December 31, 2004 and



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 26, 2003 consists primarily of minimum pension
liabilities and the fair value of fuel hedging contracts. (See
Note 14, Shareholders Equity.)

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and measures those
instruments at fair value. (See Note 13, Derivative
Financial Instruments.)

New Accounting Pronouncements and Change in Accounting
    Policy

In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue
No. 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on
Diluted Earnings Per Share. The EITF states that contingently
convertible debt instruments are subject to the
“if-converted” method under SFAS 128, Earnings
Per Share, regardless of fulfillment of any of the contingent
features included in the instrument. This consensus is effective
for periods ending after December 15, 2004 and the
consensus must be applied by restating all periods during which
the instrument was outstanding.

Effective for the fourth quarter of 2004, CSX is required to
include approximately 10 million shares underlying its
convertible debt instrument using the “if-converted”
method in the computation of earnings per share, assuming
dilution. The dilutive impact for all periods is approximately
2%-5%.

SFAS 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” was issued in 2001. This statement addresses
financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
the associated retirement costs. In conjunction with the
group-life method of accounting for asset costs, the Company
historically accrued crosstie removal costs as a component of
depreciation, which is not permitted under SFAS 143. As
noted above, with the adoption of SFAS 143 in fiscal year
2003, CSX recorded pretax income of $93 million,
$57 million after tax, as a cumulative effect of an
accounting change, representing the reversal of the accrued
liability for crosstie removal costs. The adoption of
SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on prior reporting
periods, and the Company does not believe it will have a
material effect on future earnings. On an ongoing basis,
depreciation expense will be reduced, while labor and fringe and
materials, supplies and other expense will be increased by
approximately $12 million as a result of the adoption of
SFAS 143.

SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure” was
issued in December 2002. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide
alternative methods of transition to Statement 123’s
fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and require disclosure of the effects of an
entity’s accounting policy with respect to stock-based
employee compensation. Effective beginning with fiscal year
2003, CSX has voluntarily adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” and adopted the disclosure requirements of
SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure —
an amendment of SFAS 123.” In accordance with the
prospective method of adoption permitted under SFAS 148,
stock-based awards issued subsequent to fiscal year 2002 are
accounted for under the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS 123 utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation
method and, accordingly, are expensed. (See Note  16,
Stock Plans.)

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123®,
“Share-Based Payment”, which is a revision of
SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”. Currently, the Company uses the
Black-Scholes-Merton formula to estimate the value of stock
options granted to employees and



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expects to continue to use this acceptable option valuation
model upon the required adoption of SFAS 123® on
July 1, 2005. Because SFAS 123® must be applied
not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are
not fully vested on the effective date, and because the Company
adopted SFAS 123 using the prospective transition method
(which applied only to awards granted, modified or settled after
the adoption date), compensation cost for some previously
granted awards that were not recognized under SFAS 123 will
be recognized under SFAS 123®. However, had CSX
adopted SFAS 123® in prior periods, the impact of that
standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as
described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings
per share above. SFAS 123® also requires the benefits
of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to
be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow as required under current literature. This
requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase
net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 123® on its
consolidated financial statements, but is not yet in a position
to determine the impact of the revised standard. However, the
effect could be material.

In 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which
requires a variable interest entity (“VIE”) to be
consolidated by a company that is subject to a majority of the
risk of loss from the VIE’s activities or is entitled to
receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns, or
both. Interpretation No. 46 also requires disclosures about
VIEs that a company is not required to consolidate but in which
it has a significant variable interest. Also in 2003,
Interpretation 46 (“46R”), a revision to FASB
Interpretation No. 46 was issued, to clarify some of the
provisions of, and to exempt certain entities from,
Interpretation 46 requirements. Under the rules of the new
guidance, CSX consolidated FRT, a shortline railroad, into its
financial statements at the beginning of fiscal year 2004. The
adoption of Interpretation No. 46 will not have a material
impact on results of operations in future reporting periods.
Previously, FRT was accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Other income includes net equity earnings for FRT
for the year ended December 26, 2003. The following table
indicates the impact of consolidating FRT in 2004 compared to
equity method accounting in 2003.

In 2002, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard
Interpretation (“FASI”) No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” This statement requires that certain guarantees be
recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and
additional disclosures be made about guarantees. CSX did not
realize a financial statement impact with the adoption of the
accounting provisions of this statement in fiscal year 2003 and
does not anticipate a future impact. (See Note 19,
Commitments and Contingencies.)



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2001, SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”, was issued. Under the provisions of SFAS 142,
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are no
longer amortized, but are reviewed for impairment on a periodic
basis. The Company adopted this standard for fiscal 2002, and
incurred a pretax charge of $83 million, $43 million
after tax, and minority interest as a cumulative effect of an
accounting change, which represents the difference between book
value and the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets.
These indefinite lived intangible assets are permits and
licenses that the Company holds relating to a proposed pipeline
to transfer natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to the
port in Valdez, Alaska. The fair value was determined using a
discount method of projected future cash flows relating to these
assets. The carrying value of these assets is now approximately
$3 million. The adoption of SFAS 142 did not have a
material effect on prior reporting periods, and the Company does
not believe it will have a material effect on future earnings.
The Company does not have any other significant indefinite lived
intangible assets.

In 2002, SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” was issued. This statement
requires that long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are no
longer measured on a net realizable value basis, and future
operating losses are no longer recognized before they occur. In
addition, this statement modifies the reporting requirements for
discontinued operations. Long-lived assets, whether to be held
for disposition or held and used, should be measured at the
lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to dispose.
The Company applied the provisions of this statement relating to
the accounting for the conveyance of its wholly-owned
subsidiary, CSX Lines, to a third party in 2003 (See
Note 3, Divestitures.)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts
of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those
estimates. Critical accounting estimates using management
judgment are made for the following areas:

NOTE 2.

Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail

As previously reported, in June 2003 CSX, Norfolk Southern
Corporation (“NS”), and Conrail Inc.
(“Conrail”) jointly filed a petition with the STB to
establish direct ownership and control by CSX’s and
NS’ respective subsidiaries, CSXT and Norfolk Southern
Railway Company (“NSR”), of CSX’s and NS’
portions of the Conrail system already operated by them
separately and independently under various agreements. These
portions of the Conrail system were owned by Conrail’s
subsidiaries, New York Central Lines, LLC (“NYC”) and
Pennsylvania Lines, LLC (“PRR”). In August 2004, the
following events occurred: (i) the ownership of NYC and PRR
was transferred (“spun off”) to CSXT and NSR,
respectively, and (ii) the parties consummated an exchange
offer of new unsecured securities of subsidiaries of CSXT and
NSR for unsecured securities of Conrail. The exchange offer was
the final stage in the restructuring of Conrail’s unsecured
indebtedness as described in the parties’ joint petition
filed with the STB.



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

CSXT and NSR offered unsecured debt securities of newly formed
subsidiaries in an approximate 42%/58% ratio in exchange for
Conrail’s unsecured debentures. The debt securities issued
by each respective subsidiary were fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by CSXT and NSR. Upon completion of the transaction,
the subsidiaries merged into CSXT and NSR, respectively, and the
new debt securities thus became direct unsecured obligations of
CSXT and NSR. Conrail’s secured debt and lease obligations
are supported by new leases and subleases which became the
direct lease and sublease obligations, also in an approximate
42%/58% ratio, of CSXT and NSR.

Prior to the transaction, CSX’s and NS’ indirect
ownership interest in NYC and PRR mirrored their ownership
interest in Conrail (42% for CSX and 58% for NS). As a result of
the transaction, CSX obtained direct ownership of NYC and NS
obtained direct ownership PRR. Thus, CSX in effect received
NS’ 58% indirect ownership in NYC and NS in effect received
CSX’s 42% indirect ownership of PRR. The receipt of the
interest not already indirectly owned by CSX was accounted for
at fair value. The receipt of the NYC interest already
indirectly owned by CSX was accounted for using CSX’s basis
in amounts already included within CSX’s investment in
Conrail. At the conclusion of the transaction, NYC was merged
into CSXT and PRR was merged into NSR.

As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a net
gain of $16 million, after tax, which is included in other
income.

The Company recorded this transaction at fair value based on the
results of an independent valuation. The following table
summarizes the estimated fair value of the acquired assets and
liabilities assumed at the date of the spin-off and at the end
of the prior year and its effects on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 24, 2004. Fair
value adjustments are non-cash transactions and, accordingly,
have no cash impact on the Consolidated Cash Flow Statements:

The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on the
Consolidated Income Statements as if the spin-off transaction
had been completed as of the beginning of the periods.

Since September of 2004, the impact of the transaction has been
included in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statement.

As a result of the spin-off transaction, CSX’s investment
in Conrail no longer includes the amounts related to NYC and
PRR. Instead the assets and liabilities of NYC are reflected in
their respective line items in CSX’s Consolidated Balance
Sheet. As previously reported, Conrail will continue to own,
manage, and operate the Shared Assets Areas. However, this
transaction effectively decreased rents paid to Conrail after
the transaction date, as some assets previously leased from
Conrail are now owned by CSXT.

Accounting and Financial Reporting Effects

Prior to the spin-off transaction, CSX’s rail and
intermodal operating revenue includes revenue from traffic
moving on Conrail property. Operating expenses include costs
incurred to handle such traffic and operate the Conrail lines.
Rail operating expense includes an expense category,
“Conrail Rents, Fees and Services,” which reflects:

Divestitures

In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its interest in its
domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines, to a new
venture formed with The Carlyle Group for approximately
$300 million (gross cash proceeds of approximately
$240 million, $214 million net of transaction costs,
and $60 million of securities). CSX Lines was subsequently
renamed Horizon. Horizon subleased vessels and equipment from
certain affiliates of CSX covering the primary financial
obligations related to $265 million of leases under which
CSX or one of its affiliates will remain a lessee/ sublessor or
guarantor. A deferred pretax gain of approximately
$127 million as a result of the transaction is being
recognized over the 12-year sub-lease term. The securities
contained a term of 7 years and a preferred return feature.
During the third quarter of 2003, CSX received a
$15 million payment from Horizon Lines, which included
$3 million of interest, in return of a portion of its
investment in Horizon. The investing section of the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows includes proceeds from divestiture of
$226 million and $3 million of interest on investment
is included in net earnings.

In July 2004, Horizon was acquired by an unrelated third party,
and CSX received $59 million, which included
$48 million for the purchase of its ownership interest in
Horizon, $4 million of interest, and a performance payment
of $7 million, which will also be recognized over the
12-year sub-lease term. The investing section of the
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows includes proceeds from
divestiture of $55 million and $4 million of interest
on investment is included in net earnings. However, CSX and one
of its affiliates will continue to remain a lessee/ sublessor or
guarantor on certain vessels and equipment as long as the
subleases remain in effect. (See Note 19. Commitments and
Contingencies.)

NOTE 4.

Discontinued Operations

On February 22, 2005 CSX sold its International Terminals
business through the sale of all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of SL Service, Inc. (“SLSI”),
and all of its interest in Orange Blossom Investment Company,
Ltd. to Dubai Ports International FZE (“DPI”) for
closing cash consideration of $1.142 billion, subject to
final working capital and long-term debt adjustments. As a
result of the sale CSX will recognize a pretax gain in the first
quarter of 2005 and expects to tender substantial tax payments
triggered by the transaction beginning in the second quarter of
2005. Of the gross proceeds, approximately $115 million is
allocated for the purchase of a minority interest in an
International Terminals’ subsidiary, acquired in the first
quarter of 2005 and divested as part of the sale to DPI.
Approximately $100 million was paid for this interest
subsequent to December 31, 2004, with the final payment
expected in the first quarter of 2005. The Company is

considering options regarding the use of net cash proceeds
including reduction of debt and other corporate purposes.

SLSI also holds certain residual assets and liabilities as a
result of prior divestitures and discontinuances. A wholly-owned
subsidiary of CSX retains the rights to those assets and
indemnifies DPI, SLSI and related entities against those
liabilities pursuant to a separate agreement. CSX guarantees the
obligations of its subsidiary under this separate agreement.

Consequently, the results of operations and financial position
of the Company’s International Terminals business are
reported as Discontinued Operations for all periods presented.

In 2004, Discontinued Operations on the Consolidated Income
Statement includes International Terminals’ net earnings of
$18 million as well as additional tax expense of
$97 million related to undistributed foreign earnings.

Discontinued Operations includes International Terminals
restructuring initiatives of $6 million for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2004, in an effort to maintain and
improve productivity standards in light of current business
conditions. International Terminals recorded no such charges in
2003. The restructuring initiatives have reduced the
international terminals workforce by 183 positions, as of
December 31, 2004.

Management Restructuring

Surface Transportation incurred restructuring charges related to
the November 2003 management restructuring plan to streamline
the structure, eliminate organizational layers and realign
certain functions. For the fiscal year ended December 31,
2004, the Company recorded expense of $71 million for
separation expense, pension and post-retirement benefit
curtailment charges, stock compensation expense and other
related expenses. Surface Transportation recorded an initial
pretax charge related to this reduction of $34 million in
2003. The restructuring initiatives have reduced the
non-contract Surface Transportation workforce by 863 positions,
as of December 31, 2004.

The total cost of the program through the fiscal year
December 31, 2004 is $105 million for Surface
Transportation. The majority of separation benefits will be paid
from CSX’s qualified pension plan, with the remainder being
paid from general corporate funds. See the table below for a

In conjunction with the sale of all the issued and outstanding
stock of SL Service, Inc., the Company accrued $97 million
of deferred U.S. income tax liability related to
undistributed foreign earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that
are no longer considered indefinitely invested in offshore
operations. This U.S. income tax expense is reflected as a
component of Discontinued Operations — Net of Tax on
the 2004 Consolidated Income Statement.

Included in the net deferred tax liabilities above are
$16 million and $45 million of deferred taxes included
in International Terminals Liabilities Held for Sale in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2004 and
December 26, 2003. (See Note 4. Discontinued
Operations.)

At December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, the
Company had not recorded domestic deferred or additional foreign
income taxes related to undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries that were considered, at the time, to be
indefinitely reinvested in offshore operations. These earnings
amounted to $387 million and $341 million at
December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively.

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return,
which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations
of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed
through 1993. Federal income tax returns for 1994 through 2003
currently are under examination. Management believes adequate
provision has been made for any adjustments that might be
assessed.

The increase in the 2004 effective income tax rate compared to
the prior year is primarily attributable to a larger percentage
of total pretax earnings in 2004 than in 2003. Additionally,
2003 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the cumulative
impact of changes in the Company’s deferred effective state
income tax rates. The 2003 effective income tax rate was lower
than the 2002 effective income tax rate because equity in
Conrail earnings represented a larger percentage of pretax
earnings in 2003 than 2002. Also, 2003 included a favorable
state income tax benefit attributable to changes in the
Company’s deferred effective state income tax rate.

Sale of Accounts Receivable

As of June 2003, CSXT discontinued its accounts receivable
securitization program. Prior to that, CSXT sold, without
recourse, a revolving pool of accounts receivable to CSX Trade
Receivables Corporation (“CTRC”), a bankruptcy-remote
entity wholly owned by CSX. CTRC transferred the accounts
receivable to a master trust and caused the trust to issue
multiple series of certificates representing undivided interests
in the receivables. The certificates issued by the master trust
were sold to investors, and the proceeds from those sales were
paid to CSXT. Net losses associated with the sale of receivables
were $10 million and $26 million for the fiscal years

Casualty Reserves

Casualty reserves represent accruals for the uninsured portion
of personal injury and occupational injury claims.

Personal Injury

In 2003, CSX retained an independent actuarial firm to assist
management in assessing the value of CSX’s personal injury
portfolio. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial
firm semi-annually. The methodology used by the actuary includes
a development factor to reflect growth in the value of the
Company’s personal injury claims. This methodology is based
largely on CSX’s historical claims and settlement activity.
Actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and
severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments, and
uncertainties surrounding the litigation process. In conjunction
with the change in estimate during the third quarter of 2003,
the Company recorded a charge of $26 million for personal
injury liabilities. Reserves for personal injury claims are
$383 million and $355 million at December 31,
2004 and December 26, 2003, respectively.

While the final outcome of casualty-related matters cannot be
predicted with certainty, considering among other things the
meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have
been recorded, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of
these items, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position or liquidity.
However, should a number of these items occur in the same
period, it could have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year.

Occupational

Occupational claims include allegations of exposure to certain
materials in the work place, such as asbestos, solvents, and
diesel fuel, or alleged physical injuries, such as carpal tunnel
syndrome or hearing loss.

Asbestos

The Company is party to a number of occupational claims by
employees exposed to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest
exposure for CSX employees was due to work conducted in and
around the use of steam locomotive engines that were phased out
between the early 1950’s and late 1960’s. However,
other types of exposures, including exposure from locomotive
component parts and building materials, continued after 1967,
until it was substantially eliminated by 1985.

Asbestos claim filings against the Company have been
inconsistent. Accordingly, while the Company had concluded that
a probable loss had occurred, it did not believe it could
estimate the range of reasonably possible loss because of the
lack of experience with such claims and the lack of



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

detailed employment records for the population of exposed
employees. Claim filings increased and when they continued into
2003, the Company concluded that an estimate for incurred but
not reported asbestos exposure liability needed to be recorded.

In 2003, CSX engaged a third party, who has extensive experience
in performing asbestos and other occupational studies, to assist
in assessing the unasserted liability exposure. The objective of
the assessment was to determine the number of estimated incurred
but not reported asbestos claims and the estimated average cost
per claim to be received over the next seven years. Seven years
was determined by management to be the time period in which
claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more
certainty.

The Company, with the assistance of the third party, first
determined its exposed population from which it was able to
derive the estimated number of incurred but not reported claims.
The estimated average cost per claim was then determined
utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data. Based on
the assessment, in September 2003 the Company recorded an
undiscounted $141 million pre-tax charge for unasserted
asbestos claims. Key elements of the assessment included the
following:

From these assumptions CSX projected the incidence of each type
of disease to the estimated population to arrive at an estimate
of the total number of employees that could potentially assert a
claim. Historical claim filing rates were applied for each type
of disease to the total number of employees that could
potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of
anticipated claim filings by disease type. Historical dismissal
rates, which represent claims that are closed without payment,
were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by
disease type that would likely require payment by the Company.
Finally, the number of such claims was multiplied by the average
settlement value to estimate CSX’s future liability for
incurred but not reported asbestos claims.

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim
values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve.
Asbestos claim filings are typically sporadic and may include
large batches of claims solicited by law firms. To reflect these
factors, CSX used a two-year calibration period during its
initial assessment because the Company believed it would be most
representative of its future claim experience. In addition, for
non-malignant claims, the number of future claims to be filed
against CSX declines at a rate consistent with both mortality
and age as there is a decreasing probability of filing claims as
the population ages. CSX believes the average claim values



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

by type of disease from the historical period 2001-2002 are most
representative of future claim values. Non-malignant claims,
which represent approximately 90% of the total number and 91% of
the cost of estimated future asbestos claims, were valued by age
of the projected claimants. Historically, the ultimate
settlement value of these types of claims is most sensitive to
the age of the claimant. A 10% increase or decrease in either
the forecasted number of incurred but not reported claims or the
average claim values would result in an approximate
$14 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded
for unasserted asbestos claims.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, management updated their
assessment of the unasserted liability exposure with the
assistance of the third party specialists. In 2004, individual
asbestos claims continued to be sporadic and proved to be
submitted at a low rate for the year. In further review of the
data, the bulk claims filed by the law firms appear to be filed
against the Company every other year. As a result, management
reassessed the calibration period to a 4-year average
(2000-2004) to capture the most recent filing experience within
the context of the bulk law firm filings.

CSX will obtain semi-annual updates of the study. On a quarterly
basis, CSX will monitor actual experience against the number of
forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments.
Adjustments to our estimates will be recorded quarterly if
necessary. More periodic updates to the study will occur if
trends necessitate a change. At December 31, 2004, the
Company had recorded undiscounted liabilities of
$212 million for asbestos-related claims. Of the amount
recorded, $132 million is related to incurred but not
reported claims while $80 million is related to asserted
claims. As of December 26, 2003, the Company had recorded
undiscounted liabilities of $246 for asbestos-related claims.
Current liabilities include $37 million and
$20 million of asbestos-related claims as of
December 31, 2004 and December 26, 2003, respectively.
Defense and processing costs, which historically have been and
are anticipated in the future to be insignificant, are not
included in the recorded liability. The Company is presently
self-insured for asbestos-related claims.

Other Occupational

In the third quarter of 2003, the Company changed its estimate
of occupational reserves to include an estimate of incurred but
not reported claims for other occupational injuries as well as
asbestos as noted above. The Company engaged a third party
specialist to assist in projecting the number of other
occupational injury claims to be received over the next seven
years and the related costs. Based on this analysis, the Company
established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable
other occupational injury liabilities. In the third quarter of
2003, the Company recorded an undiscounted $65 million
pre-tax charge for incurred but not reported other occupational
claims for similar reasons as asbestos discussed above. Similar
to the asbestos liability estimation process, the key elements
of the assessment included the following:

•

An estimate of the potentially exposed population for other
    occupational diseases was calculated by projecting active versus
    retired work force from 2002 to 2010 using a growth rate
    projection for overall railroad employment made by the Railroad
    Retirement Board in its June 2003 report.

•

An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type
    of injury, employee type, and active versus retired employee was
    computed using the Company’s average historical claim
    filing rates for the calibration period 2002-2003 for all
    diseases except hearing loss. Because the filing rate for
    hearing loss claims has been decreasing since 1998, the latest
    year filing of 2003 was used. These calibration periods are the
    time periods which management felt were representative of future
    filing rates. An estimate was made to forecast future claims by
    using the filing rates by disease and the active and retired CSX
    population each year.



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of
    injury was computed using the Company’s historical average
    of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using
    the average settlement by type of injury observed during
    2001-2003.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had recorded undiscounted
liabilities of $110 million for other occupational-related
claims. Of the amount recorded, $56 million is related to
incurred but not reported claims while $54 million is
related to asserted claims. As of December 26, 2003, the
Company had recorded undiscounted liabilities of
$111 million for other occupational-related claims. Current
liabilities include $18 million and $4 million at
December 31, 2004 and December 26, 2003, respectively.
Defense and processing costs, which historically have been and
are anticipated in the future to be insignificant, are not
included in the recorded liability. The Company is presently
self-insured for other occupational-related claims.

A summary of existing asbestos and other occupational claims
activity is as follows:

Approximately 6,000 of the open claims at December 31, 2004
are asbestos claims against the Company’s previously owned
international container-shipping business, Sea-Land. Because the
Sea-Land claims are against multiple vessel owners, the
Company’s reserves reflect its portion of those claims. The
remaining open claims have been asserted against CSXT. The
Company had approximately $13 million reserved for the
Sea-Land claims at December 31, 2004 and December 26,
2003.

The amounts recorded by CSX for the occupational liability were
based upon currently known facts. Projecting future events, such
as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average
cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous
uncertainties surrounding asbestos and other occupational
litigation in the United States, could cause the actual costs to
be higher or lower than projected.

Environmental Reserves

CSXT is a party to various proceedings, including administrative
and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and
regulatory agencies related to environmental issues. CSXT has
been identified as a PRP at approximately 252 environmentally
impaired sites, many of which are, or may be, subject to
remedial action under the Superfund or similar state statutes. A
number of these proceedings are based on allegations that CSXT,
or its railroad predecessors, sent hazardous substances to the
facilities in question for disposal.

In addition, some of CSXT’s land holdings are and have been
used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased
to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have
resulted in releases onto the property. Therefore, CSXT is
subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions
including under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), also
known as the Superfund law, as well as similar



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

state laws that may impose joint and several liability for
cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and
operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of
the original conduct, which could be substantial. In the fourth
quarter of 2004, CSX added $6 million of Conrail
environmental claims, due to the Conrail spin-off transaction.

At least once a quarter, CSXT reviews its role with respect to
each site identified. Based on the review process, CSXT has
recorded reserves to cover estimated contingent future
environmental costs with respect to such sites. Environmental
costs are charged to expense when they relate to an existing
condition caused by past operations and do not contribute to
current or future revenue generation. The recorded liabilities
for estimated future environmental costs at December 31,
2004 and December 26, 2003 were $59 million and
$45 million, respectively. These liabilities, which are
undiscounted, include amounts representing CSXT’s estimate
of unasserted claims, which CSXT believes to be immaterial. The
liability includes future costs for all sites where the
Company’s obligation is (1) deemed probable and
(2) where such costs can be reasonably estimated. The
liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration
of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs,
but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries.

The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to
reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if
any, on some sites until completion of future environmental
studies. In addition, latent conditions at any given location
could result in exposure, the amount and materiality of which
cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information
currently available, however, the Company believes its
environmental reserves are adequate to accomplish remedial
actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that
the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not
materially affect its overall results of operations and
financial condition.

Separation Liability

Separation liabilities at December 31, 2004 and
December 26, 2003 include productivity charges recorded in
1991, 1992, 1995, 2003 and 2004 to provide for the estimated
costs of implementing workforce reductions, improvements in
productivity and other cost reductions at the Company’s
major transportation units. The remaining separation liabilities
are expected to be paid out over the next 15 to 20 years.
Separation liabilities also include amounts payable through
general corporate funds under the Company’s management
restructuring programs. (See Note 5, Management
Restructuring.)

In February 2004, the Company executed a $100 million bank
financing that matures February 25, 2005, which bore
interest at a rate that varied with LIBOR plus an applicable
spread. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had
$100 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding
under this agreement. The Company settled this obligation with
cash at maturity.

In June 2004, the Company executed a $300 million bank
financing with a maturity date of December 29, 2004, which
bore interest at a rate that varied with LIBOR plus an
applicable spread. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had
repaid the entire aggregate principal amount outstanding under
this agreement and terminated this agreement.

In August 2004, the Company issued $300 million of floating
rate notes with a maturity date of August 3, 2006. The
notes bear interest at a rate that varies with LIBOR plus an
applicable spread. These notes are not redeemable prior to
maturity.

In August 2003, the Company issued $300 million aggregate
principal amount of the Company’s Notes due 2013. These
Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.50% and mature on
August 1, 2013. The Notes may be redeemed by the Company at
any time.

In November 2003, CSX issued $200 million aggregate
principal amount of the Company’s Notes due 2014 and
$200 million aggregate principal amount of the
Company’s Notes due 2006. The 2014 Notes bear interest at
the rate of 5.30% per year and mature on February 15,
2014. The 2006 Notes bear interest at the rate of 2.75% per
year and mature on February 15, 2006. The Company may
redeem the 2014 Notes at any time, but the 2006 Notes cannot be
redeemed before maturity.

In December 2003, CSX executed a $75 million revolving loan
facility with a maturity date in 2005. Borrowings under the
facility bore interest at a rate that fluctuated with LIBOR. In
addition, the Company paid an annual commitment fee of 0.15% for
the period the facility was not drawn. This debt was redeemable
at any time after May 2004, with additional borrowings allowed
through the maturity of the facility. As of December 31,
2004, the Company had $75 million in aggregate principal



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amount outstanding under this borrowing. In January 2005, the
Company paid this obligation in full with cash.

During 2002, CSX issued $200 million of 4.88% notes
due in 2009 and $400 million of 6.30% notes due in
2012.

Debt Repayments

CSX repaid long-term debt of $434 million in 2004 compared
to $500 million in 2003, including outstanding debt
obligations of $300 million that matured in August 2004.
The primary sources of 2004 debt repayments were the issuance of
new debt combined with cash on hand.

The Company also paid a net $141 million in short-term debt
during 2003. The primary sources of 2003 repayments were the
$214 million of proceeds from the conveyance of CSX Lines
(see Note 3, Divestitures) and the issuance of new debt.

Long-term and short-term debt at December 31, 2004 and
December 26, 2003, totaled $7.2 billion and
$7.3 billion, respectively. The ratio of debt to total
capitalization was 48% and 51% at December 31, 2004 and
December 26, 2003, respectively.

Convertible Debentures

In October 2001, CSX issued $564 million aggregate
principal amount at maturity in unsubordinated zero coupon
convertible debentures (the “debentures”) due
October 30, 2021 for an initial offering price of
approximately $462 million. At December 31, 2004 and
December 26, 2003, outstanding debentures are included in
long-term debt, at a carrying value of $463 million and
$447 million, respectively. These debentures accrete
(increase) in value at a yield to maturity of 1% per year.
The accretion rate may be reset on October 30, 2007,
October 30, 2011, and October 30, 2016 to a rate based
on five-year United States Treasury Notes minus 2.8%. In no
event, however, will the yield to maturity be reset below 1% or
above 3% per annum. Accretion in value on the debentures is
recorded for each period, but will not be paid prior to maturity.

Under the terms of the debentures, holders had the option to
require the Company to purchase their debentures at a purchase
price equal to the accreted value of the debentures in October
2003. CSX purchased $15 million aggregate principal amount
at maturity of the debentures at an aggregate cost of
$13 million. In November 2003, the Company made a one-time
cash payment of $23.00 per $1,000 aggregate principal
amount at maturity to holders who did not require the Company to
purchase their debentures. This resulted in a $13 million
cash payment, which will be amortized over the remaining term of
the debentures. In addition, the terms of the debentures were
amended to permit holders to cause the Company to purchase the
debentures on October 30, 2005, at their accreted value of
$852.48 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, in
addition to the purchase dates provided under the terms of the
debentures. As a result, the debentures are classified in
Current Maturities of Long-term Debt in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Similarly, the debentures allow holders to require the
Company to purchase their debentures in October 2006, October
2008, October 2011, and October 2016, at a purchase price equal
to the accreted value of the debentures. CSX may redeem the
debentures for cash at any time on or after October 30,
2008, at a redemption price equal to the accreted value of the
debentures.

CSX amended the terms of these debentures during the third
quarter of 2004 to surrender its right to pay the purchase
price, in whole or in part, in shares of CSX’s common stock
for debentures tendered to CSX at the option of holders on
certain specified purchase dates. As a result, CSX will be
required to pay the purchase price for such debentures on such
specified purchase dates in cash.



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Holders may in addition convert their debentures into shares of
the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 17.75
common shares per debenture, subject to customary anti-dilution
adjustments, if any of the following conditions are satisfied:

The accreted conversion price of the debentures at
December 31, 2004 was $47.64 and the threshold price to be
met in order to convert the debentures into common stock was
$56.46 per common share.

Credit Facilities

The Company has a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured
revolving credit facility expiring in May 2009 and a
$400 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility
expiring in May 2005. The facilities were entered into in May
2004 on terms substantially similar to the facilities they
replaced: a $345 million unsecured revolving credit
facility that expired in May 2004 and a $1.0 billion
unsecured revolving credit facility that would have expired in
May 2006. Generally, these facilities may be used for general
corporate purposes, to support the Company’s commercial
paper, and for working capital. Neither of the credit facilities
were drawn on as of December 31, 2004. Commitment fees and
interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees
and rates available to comparably rated investment-grade
borrowers. Similar to the credit facilities they replaced, these
credit facilities allow for borrowings at floating (LIBOR-based)
rates, plus a spread, depending upon our senior unsecured debt
ratings. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with all covenant requirements under the facilities.

Shelf Registration Statements

CSX currently has $900 million of capacity under an
effective shelf registration that may be used, subject to market
conditions and board authorization, to issue debt or equity
securities at the Company’s discretion. The Company
presently intends to use the proceeds from the sale of any
securities issued under its shelf registration statement to
finance cash requirements, including refinancing existing debt
as it matures. While the Company seeks to give itself
flexibility with respect to meeting such needs, there can be no
assurance that market conditions would permit the Company to
sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or
at all.

Under these agreements, the Company will pay variable interest
based on LIBOR in exchange for a fixed rate, effectively
transforming the notes to floating rate obligations. The

CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the fixed
rate note attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in
current earnings during the period of change in fair values.
Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the
relative change in fair value of the derivative contract in
comparison with changes over time in the fair value of the fixed
rate notes. Any change in fair value resulting from
ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, “Accounting
For Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” is
recognized immediately in earnings. The Company’s interest
rate swaps qualify as perfectly effective fair value hedges, as
defined by SFAS 133. As such, there was no ineffective
portion to the hedge recognized in earnings during the current
or prior year periods. Long-term debt has been increased by
$26 million and $56 million for the fair market value
of the interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004
and December 26, 2003, respectively.

The differential to be paid or received under these agreements
is accrued based on the terms of the agreements and is
recognized in interest expense over the term of the related
debt. The related amounts payable to or receivable from
counterparties are included in other current liabilities or
assets. Cash flows related to interest rate swap agreements are
classified as Operating Activities in the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statements. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004
and December 26, 2003, the Company reduced interest expense
by approximately $32 million and $45 million,
respectively, as a result of the interest rate swap agreements
that were in place during each period. Fair value adjustments
are non-cash transactions and, accordingly, have no cash impact
on the Consolidated Cash Flow Statements.

The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose
the Company to credit loss in the event of non-performance. The
Company does not anticipate non-performance by the
counterparties.

Fuel Hedging

In the third quarter of 2003, CSX began a program to hedge a
portion of its future locomotive fuel purchases. This program
was established to manage exposure to fuel price fluctuations.
In order to minimize this risk, CSX has entered into a series of
swaps in order to fix the price of a portion of its estimated
future fuel purchases.

Following is a summary of outstanding fuel swaps:

%

The program limits fuel hedges to a 24-month duration and a
maximum of 80% of CSX’s average monthly fuel purchased for
any month within the 24-month period, and places the hedges
among selected counterparties. Fuel hedging activity favorably
impacted fuel expense for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004 by $63 million. Fuel hedging
activity had no impact on fuel expense for the fiscal year ended
December 26, 2003. Ineffectiveness, or the extent to which
changes in the fair values of the fuel swaps did not offset
changes in the fair values of the expected fuel purchases, was
immaterial.



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

These instruments qualify, and are designated by management, as
cash-flow hedges of variability in expected future cash flows
attributable to fluctuations in fuel prices. The fair values of
fuel derivative instruments are determined based upon current
fair market values as quoted by third party dealers and are
recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with offsetting
adjustments to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, a component
of Shareholders’ Equity. Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Loss included a gain, net of tax of approximately
$66 million and $6 million as of December 31,
2004 and December 26, 2003, respectively, related to fuel
derivative instruments. Amounts are reclassed from Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Loss as the underlying fuel that was hedged
is consumed by rail operations. Fair value adjustments are
non-cash transactions and, accordingly, have no cash impact on
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statements.

The Company has temporarily suspended entering into new swaps in
its fuel hedge program since the third quarter of 2004. The
Company will continue to monitor and assess the current issues
facing the global fuel market place to decide when to resume
hedging under the program.

The counterparties to the fuel hedge agreements expose the
Company to credit loss in the event of non-performance. The
Company does not anticipate non-performance by the
counterparties.

Earnings Per Share

The following table sets forth the computation of basic earnings
per share and earnings per share, assuming dilution:



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding. Earnings per share, assuming
dilution, is based on the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of potentially
dilutive common shares, arising from convertible debt and
employee stock options and awards. During the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2004 and December 26, 2003, 517,027 and
291,908 options were exercised, respectively.

Certain potentially dilutive common shares at December 31,
2004 and December 26, 2003 were excluded from the
computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution, since
their related option exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of the common shares during the period. The
following table indicates information about potentially dilutive
common shares excluded from the computation of earnings per
share:

In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue
No. 04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on
Diluted Earnings Per Share. The EITF states that contingently
convertible debt instruments are subject to the
“if-converted” method under SFAS 128, Earnings
Per Share, regardless of fulfillment of any of the contingent
features included in the instrument. This consensus is effective
for periods ending after December 15, 2004 and the
consensus must be applied by restating all periods during which
the instrument was outstanding.

Effective for the fourth quarter of 2004, CSX is required to
include approximately 10 million shares underlying its
convertible debt instrument using the “if-converted”
method in the computation of earnings per share, assuming
dilution. The dilutive impact for all periods is approximately
2%-5%.

A substantial increase in the fair market value of the
Company’s stock price could trigger contingent conditions
for conversion and allow holders to convert their debentures
into CSX common stock and thus negatively impact basic earnings
per share.

At December 31, 2004, there were 3,441 current or former
employees with grants outstanding under the various plans. A
total of approximately 39 million shares were reserved for
issuance under the plans of which 7 million were available
for new grants. The remaining shares are assigned to outstanding
stock options and stock awards.

The fair value of stock options granted in 2003 and 2002 was

Long Term Incentive Program

The CSX Long Term Incentive Program is designed to reward
participants for the attainment of CSX financial and customer
service improvement results leading to share price appreciation
for shareholders and employees. The objective of the plan is to
motivate and reward senior executives for achieving and
exceeding a two-year modified free cash flow goal, at which time
the award is payable in cash and CSX common stock. Assuming the
Company achieves target performance levels, approximately
0.6 million shares could be issued under the plan as of
December 31, 2004. The Company recognized $10 million
in expense associated with this program for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2004.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allowed
eligible employees to purchase CSX common stock at a discount.
Specifically, participating employees were able to purchase CSX
stock at the lower of 85% of fair market value on
December 1 (beginning of the annual offering period) or 85%
of fair market value on November 30 of the following year
(end of the annual offering period). In effect, employees
received a 12-month stock option to purchase Company stock. Once
purchased, the shares were unrestricted and could generally be
sold or transferred at any time. Employees purchased
approximately 540,000 shares and 570,000 shares under
this plan during 2003 and 2002, respectively. This plan was not
extended for 2004.

Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plans

The Company maintains the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment Plan
under which shareholders may purchase additional shares of
stock. At December 31, 2004, there were
4,946,856 shares available for issuance under this plan.

Stock Plan for Directors

The Stock Plan for Directors, approved by the shareholders in
1992, governs in part the manner in which directors’ fees
and retainers are paid. A minimum of 40% of the retainers must
be paid in common stock of the Company. In 2004, the minimum
retainer to be paid in stock increased to 50%. In addition, each
director may elect to receive up to 100% of the remaining
retainer and fees in the form of common stock of the Company. In
1997, shareholders approved amendments to the Plan that would
permit additional awards of stock or stock options.

carrying amounts. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of
long-term debt, including current maturities, was
$7.7 billion, compared with a carrying amount of
$7.2 billion. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of
long-term debt, including current maturities, was
$7.8 billion, compared with a carrying amount of
$7.3 billion. The fair value of long-term debt has been
estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based upon the
Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of financing arrangements. The Company’s interest
rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 and
December 26, 2003 had a fair value of $26 million and
$56 million, respectively. The Company’s fuel hedging
agreements at December 31, 2004 and December 26, 2003
had a fair value of $117 million and $9 million,
respectively.

NOTE 18.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans, principally
for salaried, non-contract personnel. The plans provide eligible
employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years
of service and compensation rates near retirement.

In addition to the defined benefit pension plans, the Company
sponsors one medical plan and one life insurance plan that
provide benefits to full-time, salaried, non-contract employees
hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if
certain eligibility requirements are met. The postretirement
medical plans are contributory (partially funded by retirees),
with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance
plan is non-contributory.

As permitted by SFAS 87, the Company has elected to use a
plan fiscal year of October 1 through September 30 to
actuarially value its pension and postretirement plans as it
provides for more timely analysis. The Company engages
independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of
liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the
assumptions that the Company selects as of the beginning of the
plan year.

The benefit obligation for these plans represents the liability
of the Company for current and retired employees and is affected
primarily by the following:

Plan assets are amounts that have been segregated and restricted
to provide benefits, and include amounts contributed by the
Company and amounts earned from investing contributions, less

benefits paid. The Company funds the cost of the postretirement
medical and life insurance benefits on a pay-as-you go basis.
CSX expects to make cash contributions of $2 million to its
pension plans in 2005.

The benefits as of December 31, 2004 expected to be paid in
each of the next five fiscal years, and in the aggregate for the
five fiscal years thereafter are as follows:

Asset management for the pension fund is founded upon an asset
allocation strategy that was developed using asset return
simulation in conjunction with projected plan liabilities. The
allocation seeks maximization of returns within the constraints
of acceptable risks considering the long-term investment
horizon. CSX has established a target allocation of 60% equity
and 40% fixed income investments. The goal is to maintain assets
at or above benefit obligations (long-term liabilities) without
corporate contributions.

The distribution of pension plan assets as of the measurement
date is as follows:

The Company provides investment guidelines to both the
plan’s fixed income and equity fund managers. Within the
broad asset classes that comprise the plan’s investments,
common stocks are diversified based on allocations to domestic
and foreign stocks as mandated by the Company. Allocations are
maintained at within 3% of targets. The U.S. stock segment
includes style diversification among managers of large
capitalization stocks and small capitalization stocks. The
Company limits industry sectors, outlines individual stock
issuer concentration and monitors the use or prohibition of
derivatives and CSX securities.

Fixed income securities are diversified across fund managers and
investment style and are benchmarked to a long duration index.
The Company specifies the types of allowable investments such as
government, corporate and asset backed bonds, and limits
diversification between domestic and foreign investments and the
use of derivatives. Additionally, the Company stipulates minimum
credit quality constraints and any prohibited securities.

Individual investments or fund managers are selected in
accordance with standards of prudence as it applies to asset
diversification and investment suitability. Monitoring fund
investment performance is ongoing. Acceptable performance is
determined in the context of the long-term return objectives of
the fund and appropriate asset class benchmarks.

The following table presents components of net periodic benefit
expense:

Due to the termination of employees under the management
restructuring plan (see Note 5, Management Restructuring),
a curtailment occurred in the Company’s defined benefit
pension plans and postretirement medical plan. The estimated
cost of the curtailments of $24 million was included in the
management restructuring charge for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004. Due to the curtailments, the Company was
required to update its measurement of the assets and obligations
of these plans, which affected the net periodic benefit costs
beginning in the second quarter of 2004. A substantial portion
of benefits provided under the management restructuring
initiatives will be paid from assets of the Company’s
defined benefit pension plans.

The $13 million termination charge in 2003 represents a
curtailment charge associated with the retirement of the
Company’s former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

During 2004 and 2003, CSX recorded changes in its minimum
pension liability. These changes did not affect net earnings,
but are a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on
an after-tax basis. In 2004, the minimum pension liability
decreased by $26 million, reducing Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Loss by $18 million after tax. In 2003, the
minimum pension liability increased by $6 million,
increasing Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss by
$3 million after tax. The Company also recorded
$1 million and $10 million after tax effect of
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, relating to
Conrail’s minimum pension liability for December 31,
2004 and December 26, 2003, respectively.

In connection with recognition of the curtailments, the Company
is required to estimate and record the effects of the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
(“Act”). The Company believes that a portion of its
medical plan’s prescription drug benefit will qualify as
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D based upon a
review by the plan’s health and welfare actuary of the
plan’s prescription drug benefit compared with the
prescription drug benefit that would be paid under Medicare
Part D beginning in 2006. The reduction in the
postretirement benefit obligation as a result of the Act was
approximately $25 million. There was no immediate impact on
net earnings as an unrecognized gain will be recorded. The
effects of the Act are reflected in net postretirement benefit
costs as the unrecognized gain is amortized, which began in the
second quarter of 2004. Postretirement benefit costs were
reduced by approximately $3 million in 2004 due to the Act.

Other Plans

The Company maintains savings plans for virtually all full-time
salaried employees and certain employees covered by collective
bargaining agreements. Expense associated with these plans was
$15 million, $16 million and $15 million for
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Under collective bargaining agreements, the Company participates
in a number of union-sponsored, multi-employer benefit plans.
Payments to these plans are made as part of aggregate
assessments generally based on number of employees covered,
hours worked, tonnage moved or a combination thereof. Total
contributions of $368 million, $360 million and
$315 million were made to these plans in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies

Lease Commitments

The Company has various lease agreements with other parties with
terms up to 42 years. Non-cancelable, long-term leases
generally include provisions for maintenance, options to
purchase and options to extend the terms.

Upon consummation of the sale of the International Terminals

(See Note 4, Discontinued Operations.)

Rent expense on operating leases totaled $567 million in
2004, $556 million in 2003 and $597 million in 2002.
These amounts include net daily rental charges on railroad
operating equipment aggregating $304 million,
$296 million and $294 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, which are not long-term commitments. In addition
to these commitments, the Company also has agreements covering
equipment leased from Conrail. See Note 2, Investment In
and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail, for a description
of these commitments.

Matters Arising Out of Sale of International
    Container-Shipping Assets

In 2003, CSX finalized a settlement agreement with Maersk
resolving all remaining material disputes pending directly
between the two companies, consisting predominantly of two major
disputes. The first dispute involved a post-closing working
capital adjustment to the sale price for which the Company had
recorded a receivable of approximately $70 million. The
second dispute involved a claim of 425 million Dutch
Guilders (approximately $180 million at then prevailing

currency exchange rates) plus interest by European Container
Terminals (“ECT”) alleging breaches of contract by the
Company at the Rotterdam container terminal facility owned by
ECT.

Also in 2003, CSX entered into a final settlement agreement with
Maersk allocating responsibility between the two companies for
third party claims and litigation relating to the assets
acquired by Maersk. The two settlements reduced the
Company’s 2003 earnings by $108 million pretax,
$67 million after tax. This charge is reflected in
Operating Expense as an Additional Loss on the Sale of the
international container-shipping assets. Neither settlement has
a material impact on cash flows. (See Note 6, Operating
Expense.)

Purchase Commitments

The Company has a commitment under a long-term maintenance
program for approximately 40% of CSXT’s fleet of
locomotives. The agreement expires in 2026 and approximates
$5.8 billion. The long-term maintenance program is intended
to provide CSX access to efficient, high-quality locomotive
maintenance services at fixed price levels through the term of
the program. Under the program, CSX paid $151 million,
$130 million and $124 million during the fiscal years
ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Minimum payments are as
follows:

The Company has various commitments to purchase technology and

call for CSX to pay $36 million, $29 million and
$26 million for the fiscal years ending 2005, 2006 and
2007, respectively. The largest obligation is for purchased
communications services of $24 million per year for the
years 2005 through 2007.

STB Proceeding

In 2001 Duke Energy Corporation (“Duke”) filed a
complaint before the STB alleging that certain CSXT common
carrier coal rates were unreasonably high. In February 2004, the
STB issued a decision finding that the CSXT common carrier rates
were reasonable. While approving the rate levels, the STB also
invited Duke to request a phase-in of rate increases over some
time period. The nature and amount of any such phase-in is
uncertain, and would only apply to billings subsequent to
December 2001. In October 2004, the STB issued a decision
denying Duke’s petition for reconsideration of its February
2004 ruling. In November 2004, Duke advised the STB that it
would request phase-in relief, and filed a Petition for Review
of the STB’s decisions in the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. CSXT will continue
to consider and pursue all available legal defenses in this
matter. Administrative proceedings and legal appeals could take
several years to resolve. An unfavorable outcome to this
complaint would not have a material effect on the Company’s
financial position.



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Self-Insurance

The Company uses a combination of third-party and
self-insurance, obtaining substantial amounts of commercial
insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and
property damages. Specified levels of risk (up to
$35 million for property and $25 million for liability
per occurrence) are retained on a self-insurance basis.

Guarantees

The Company and its subsidiaries are contingently liable
individually and jointly with others as guarantors of
obligations principally relating to leased equipment, joint
ventures and joint facilities used by the Company in its
business operations. Utilizing the Company’s guarantee for
these obligations allows the obligor to take advantage of lower
interest rates and obtain other favorable terms. Guarantees are
contingent commitments issued by the Company that could require
CSX or one of its affiliates to make payment or to perform
certain actions for the guaranteed party based on another
entity’s failure to perform. As of December 31, 2004,
the Company’s guarantees can be segregated into three main
categories:

1. Guarantees of approximately $364 million of lease
    commitments assumed by A.P. Moller-Maersk (“Maersk”)
    for which the Company is contingently liable. CSX believes
    Maersk will fulfill its contractual commitments with respect to
    such leases, and CSX will have no further liabilities for those
    obligations.

2. Guarantees of approximately $70 million, of which
    $11 million may be recovered from other shareholders,
    relating to construction and cash deficiency support guarantees
    at several of the Company’s international terminal
    locations under development. The non-performance of one of its
    partners, cost overruns or non-compliance with financing loan
    covenants could cause the Company to have to perform under these
    guarantees. The Company has made equity contributions of
    $5 million under these guarantees and estimates it will be
    required to make additional equity contributions of
    $1 million in 2005. Upon consummation of the sale of the
    International Terminals business, these guarantees are expected
    to decrease. (See Note 4, Discontinued Operations.)

3. Guarantees of approximately $265 million relating
    to leases assumed as part of CSX’s conveyance of its
    interest in CSX Lines in February 2003, as discussed in
    Note 3, Divestitures.

The maximum amount of future payments the Company could be
required to make under these guarantees is the amount of the
guarantees themselves.

Contract Settlement

In 2002, the Company received $44 million as the first of
two payments to settle a contract dispute. During 2002, the
Company recognized approximately $7 million of the first
payment in other income as this amount related to prior periods.
The remaining $37 million will be recognized over the
contract period, which ends in 2020. The second payment of
$23 million was received in 2003 and will be recognized
over the contract period, which ends in 2020. The results of
this settlement will provide an average of approximately
$3 million in annual pretax earnings through 2020.

Other Legal Proceedings

CSX is involved in routine litigation incidental to its business
and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various
governmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including
those related to environmental matters, Federal Employers’
Liability Act claims by employees, other



CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

personal injury claims, and disputes and complaints involving
certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal
proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive
damages, and others purport to be class actions. While the final
outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty,
considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses
available and liabilities that have been recorded along with
applicable insurance, it is the opinion of CSX management that
none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations, financial position or liquidity of CSX.
However, an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of
these items could have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year. The
Company is also party to a number of actions, the resolution of
which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be
material to results of operations in the quarters received.

NOTE 20.

Business Segments

The Company operates in two business segments: rail and
intermodal. The rail segment provides rail freight
transportation over a network of more than 22,000 route miles in
23 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian
provinces. The intermodal segment provides integrated rail and
truck transportation services and operates a network of
dedicated intermodal facilities across North America. The
Company’s segments are strategic business units that offer
different services and are managed separately. The rail and
intermodal segments are also viewed on a combined basis as
Surface Transportation operations.

The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based
on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is
business segment operating income. The accounting policies of
the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies (see Note 1, Nature of
Operations and Significant Accounting Policies). Intersegment
sales and transfers are generally accounted for as if the sales
or transfers were to third parties, at current market prices.

The International Terminals business segment has been
reclassified to Discontinued Operations. (See Note 4.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, CSX carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures.

As of December 31, 2004, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
(CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), management has
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that
evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December 31, 2004. There were no changes in the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during
the fourth quarter of 2004 that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

CSX’s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of
the management of CSX, including the Company’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, CSX conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004
based on the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that
evaluation, management of CSX concluded that the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2004.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
