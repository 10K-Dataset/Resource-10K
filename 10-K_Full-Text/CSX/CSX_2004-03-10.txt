Surface Transportation

CSX Transportation Inc.

CSX Transportation Inc. (“CSXT”) is the
largest rail network in the eastern United States, providing
rail freight transportation over a network of more than 23,000
route miles in 23 states, the District of Columbia and two
Canadian provinces. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, CSXT
accounted for 79% of CSX’s operating revenue and 86% of
operating income in 2003.

CSX Intermodal Inc.

CSX Intermodal Inc. (“CSXI”) is the
nation’s only transcontinental intermodal transportation
service provider, operating a network of dedicated intermodal

located in Jacksonville, Florida.


International Terminals

CSX World Terminals LLC (“CSX World
Terminals”) operates container-freight terminal facilities
in Asia, Europe, Australia, Latin America and the United States.
CSX World Terminals accounted for 3% of CSX’s operating
revenues and 11% of operating income in 2003. CSX World
Terminals is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Non-transportation

The Greenbrier is a AAA Five-Diamond resort
located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. CSX Real
Property Inc. is responsible for sales, leasing and development
of CSX-owned properties, and is headquartered in Jacksonville,
Florida.

General

CSX employed an average of 37,516 employees
during 2003. The Company considers employee relations to be
good. Most of CSX’s employees are represented by labor
unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Some
of these agreements are scheduled to expire in 2004. CSX is in
the process of renegotiating most of these agreements, but the
outcome of these negotiations is uncertain at this time. For
rail employees negotiations have generally taken place over a
number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended
work stoppages. The existing agreements have remained in effect
and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are
reached or the Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which
include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of
Presidential intervention) are exhausted.

The Company makes available free of charge
through its website at www.csx.com, its annual reports on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments thereto, as soon as
reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or
furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

CSX is involved in routine litigation incidental
to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and
claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil
lawsuits, including those related to environmental matters.
Federal Employers’ Liability Act claims by employees, other
personal injury claims, and disputes and complaints involving
certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal
proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory
damages, and others purport to be class actions. While the final
outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty,
considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses
available and liabilities that have been recorded along with
applicable insurance, it is the opinion of CSX management that
none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations, financial position or liquidity of CSX.
However, an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of
these items could have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year. The
company is also party to a number of actions, the resolution


of which could result in gain realization in
amounts that could be material to results of operations in the
quarters received.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

General

CSX Corporation (“CSX” or the
“Company”) operates one of the largest rail networks
in the United States and also arranges for and provides
integrated rail and truck (“intermodal”)
transportation services across the United States and key markets
in Canada and Mexico. Surface Transportation, which includes
CSX’s rail and intermodal units, generated revenue of
$7.4 billion in 2003 compared to $7.2 billion in 2002.
Operating income for Surface Transportation was
$651 million in 2003 compared to $995 million in 2002.
CSX’s marine operations include an international terminal
services company, which operates and develops container
terminals,


distribution facilities and related terminal
activities. In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its interest
in its domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines, to a
new venture formed with the Carlyle Group. CSX also owns and
operates the Greenbrier, a AAA Five-Diamond resort located in
White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.

In 2003, revenue and volume grew in response to
strategies to persuade new customers to ship via a combination
of rail and truck, the introduction of new customer services,
and the economic recovery. However, as discussed below increased
costs and operating inefficiency in the rail network decreased
CSX’s overall profitability.

Surface Transportation

CSX’s rail system is a network, defined by
its more than 23,000 route miles, through which goods and
services flow. The inefficiency of any one element in that
network can have an effect on other components, and ultimately
affect the operating efficiency of the entire network. The
decline in CSX’s operating efficiency, coupled with the
increased price of fuel and other higher costs, reduced
CSX’s profit in 2003.

In addition to reviewing various financial
measures, CSX management uses non-financial indicators to
monitor performance and operating efficiency of its network.
Those include:

The decline in these non-financial performance
measures contributed to higher operating expenses and resulted
in a higher operating ratio for Surface Transportation, which
increased to 91.2% in 2003 from 86.1% in 2002. The number of
injuries per 100 employees increased by 11%, while the number of
FRA-reportable train accidents per million train miles showed a
31% increase from 2002 to 2003. Average train velocity, which is
a measure of efficiency, decreased 6% from 22.5 miles per hour
in 2002 to 21.1 miles per hour in 2003. The average system dwell
time, which measures the amount of time between car arrival and
departure from yards, increased 9% from 2002 to 2003. The
percent of scheduled trains departing the origin station at or
prior to the scheduled departure time and the percent of
scheduled trains arriving at the destination station within two
hours of the scheduled arrival time both showed year-over-year
declines. The number of relief crews called per day on average,
which is an indicator of efficiency in the use of crews, showed
the largest percent decline, increasing from 26 to 50.

CSX management is taking steps to identify the
source of operating inefficiencies and reduce operating
expenses. Management also is evaluating ways to restore the
network operating efficiency, while maintaining volume. This
includes reducing both gross ton-miles and the number of times a
railcar is handled, or switched, en route to its final
destination. Because American industry has changed significantly
in recent years. Management believes there are portions of
CSX’s non-core network that could be more efficiently used
by third parties. The Company is currently evaluating the lease
or sale of up to 3,000 miles of its non-core network. This would
allow CSX to return approximately 50 locomotives to the core
network, reduce capital outlays and decrease operating expenses.


These changes will allow for and require
organizational improvements. CSX is undertaking a major
management restructuring that began in November 2003 and is
expected to conclude near the end of the first quarter of 2004.
Management believes that the conveyance of CSX Lines in February
of 2003 and the resolution of the disputes with Maersk relating
to the 1999 sale of the international container shipping assets
will allow management to focus on its core surface
transportation segment.

International Terminals

CSX World Terminals’ (“CSXWT”)
Hong Kong terminal accounted for approximately 67% of
CSXWT’s revenues and 62% of operating income in 2003. The
Hong Kong terminal showed a year-over-year volume decrease of
7.2%, which corresponded with a 5.8% decrease in revenue versus
2002. Competitive pressures are rising as customers are shifting
their traffic from facilities in Hong Kong to newly opened
terminals in South China’s Guangdong region. This shift
will also translate into reduced volumes and revenue. A
significant customer of CSXWT announced that it would terminate
its marine terminal services contract during the first quarter
of 2004. This is expected to negatively impact CSXWT’s 2004
operating income by approximately $29 million and cash flow
by approximately $21 million. In December 2004, another
contract is scheduled to expire. Negotiations are in process to
maintain this contract, but if negotiations are unsuccessful,
2005 operating income may be negatively impacted by
$20 million. CSXWT expects that it will be able to replace
all or substantially all of the lost volume with new customers
representing long and short-term commercial commitments.
However, due to the increased competitive pressures, it is
possible that the profit margins achieved in the past will not
be realized in the near term.

Recognizing its need to diversify beyond the Hong
Kong terminal, CSXWT has been expanding its capacity and market
reach. During 2003, CSX’s minority owned terminal operation
located in the Shandong Province of the People’s Republic
of China commenced operations. CSXWT has also completed the
first phase of its terminal construction in Caucedo, which is
located in the Dominican Republic. The Caucedo terminal company
is an unconsolidated entity of CSXWT that began operations in
December 2003. In response to competition in the South China
Guangdong region, CSXWT has initiatives in process to maintain
and improve its productivity standards.

In addition to volume, CSXWT monitors terminal
productivity or lifts per hour. For the years ended
December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, lifts per
hour for some of the main terminals was as follows:

Overall, terminal productivity remained
relatively stable in 2003 compared to 2002.

Financial Results of Operations

Consolidated Results

CSX follows a 52/53-week fiscal reporting
calendar. Fiscal years 2003 and 2002 consisted of 52 weeks
ending on December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002,
respectively.


2003 vs. 2002

Operating Revenue

Operating revenue decreased $359 million for
the year ended December 26, 2003 to $7.8 billion,
compared to $8.2 billion for the prior year. A $627 million
decline in consolidated revenue resulted from a reduction of
revenue in the domestic container-shipping segment as a majority
of CSX’s interest in CSX Lines was conveyed during the
first quarter of 2003 (See Note 3, Divestitures). Excluding
revenue from this conveyance, revenue increased
$268 million primarily due to an increase in Surface
Transportation revenue.

Operating Income

Operating income for the year ended
December 26, 2003 was down $501 million to
$626 million, compared to $1.1 billion in the prior
year. The prior year included $38 million of operating
income of CSX Lines, which was conveyed to a new venture formed
with the Carlyle Group in the first quarter of 2003. Excluding
operating income from this conveyance, 2003 operating income
decreased $463 million.

The decrease in operating income is primarily the
result of two charges taken during 2003 totaling
$340 million. The Company recorded a $232 million
charge in conjunction with the change in estimate for casualty
reserves, which is reflected in operating expense as
“Provision for Casualty Claims” (See Note 10,
Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves). Also, CSX entered
into two settlement agreements, which together resolve all
material outstanding disputes with Maersk. This decreased the
Company’s operating income by $108 million, and is
reflected in operating expense as the additional loss on sale of
international container-shipping assets (See Note 18,
Commitments and Contingencies).

The Company also recorded $34 million pretax
as the initial charge for separation expenses related to the
management restructuring announced in November 2003. In
addition, the Company recorded a credit of $22 million
pretax related to revised estimates for railroad retirement
taxes and the amount of benefits that will ultimately be paid to
individuals under the $1.3 billion charges for separation plans
initially recorded in 1991 and 1992. For the year, the Company
has recorded a net restructuring charge of $22 million that
includes these items and additional separation charges that were
included in the third quarter results. (See Note 4,
Restructuring).

Materials, supplies and other expenses decreased
$62 million, or 4%, year-over-year, as a result of the
conveyance of most of the Company’s interest in its
domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines. Excluding the
$244 million of expenses of CSX Lines, materials, supplies and
other increased $193 million year-over-year. Approximately
$80 million of this increase relates to increased costs for
personal injuries and safety issues. An additional $20 million
of the expense deterioration is due to increased cost of
derailments. The remaining increase results from volume
increases, inflationary effects and general operational
inefficiencies, as reflected by the decline in the non-financial
performance indicators.

Fuel expense for Surface Transportation
operations increased $117 million in 2003, as compared to
the prior year. The expense increase is primarily due to
$102 million in fuel price increases, while increased
volumes were also a factor. The average price per gallon of fuel
was 96 cents per gallon for 2003 compared to 78 cents per gallon
for 2002. In order to minimize future exposure to fuel price
fluctuation risk, during 2003 the Company entered into a series
of swaps in order to fix the price on a portion of its estimated
future fuel purchases. As of December 26, 2003, 18% and 21%
of 2004 and 2005, respectively, estimated fuel purchases were
hedged. Fuel swaps did not have an effect on fuel expense for
the year ended December 26, 2003.


Favorably impacting expense was the absence of a
management bonus at its Surface Transportation companies in
2003, as approximately $45 million of such expense was
recorded in 2002.

Other Income

Other income increased $16 million to
$57 million for the year ended December 26, 2003,
compared to $41 million for the prior year. A decrease in
discounts on sales of accounts receivable due to the
discontinuance of this program and a loss on sale in 2002 that
did not recur in 2003 had a favorable impact, but were partially
offset by lower interest income and reduced real estate gains.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $27 million for
the year ended December 26, 2003 as compared to the prior
year. Lower interest rates on floating rate debt and the
favorable impact of interest rate swaps (see Note 12, Derivative
Financial Instruments) continued to benefit the Company.

Net Earnings

Net earnings were $246 million, or $1.14 per
share, for the year ended December 26, 2003, compared to
$424 million, or $1.99 per share for the prior year.

The year ended December 26, 2003 included an
after-tax cumulative effect of accounting change benefit of
$57 million, 26 cents per share, related to the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”
while the year ended December 27, 2002 included an after-tax
cumulative effect of accounting change charge of
$43 million, 20 cents per share, related to the adoption of
SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Earnings before the cumulative effect of
accounting changes were $189 million and $467 million for
the years ended December 26, 2003 and December 27,
2002, respectively. The $278 million year-over-year
decrease in net earnings primarily results from a
$145 million after-tax charge to increase the
Company’s provision for casualty reserves, a
$67 million after-tax charge to record the loss on sale of
international container-shipping assets and a $21 million
after-tax charge to record amounts associated with the
management restructuring.

The remaining decrease results from the decline
in operating income as discussed above, somewhat offset by the
favorable impact of decreased interest expenses and income taxes.

2002 vs. 2001

Operating Revenue

Fiscal year 2001 consisted of 52 weeks
ending on December 28, 2001. Operating revenue of
$8.2 billion in 2002 was slightly higher than 2001,
resulting mainly from an increase in revenues at the
Company’s domestic container-shipping unit, CSX Lines,
which offset a small decrease at the Company’s Surface
Transportation units.

Operating Income

Operating expense of $7.0 billion in 2002
was 2% lower due mainly to lower fuel and labor costs at the
Company’s Surface Transportation business. The effect on
2001 of the $60 million New Orleans litigation settlement
contributed to the favorable year-to-year comparison.


Other Income

Other income was up $32 million in 2002 as
compared to 2001, due mainly to reduced losses relating to
equity investments and other favorable miscellaneous items,
offset by lower interest income.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was reduced by $73 million
in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to refinancing fixed-rate
maturities at lower interest rates, and to a greater percentage
of outstanding debt during 2002 bearing a floating rate of
interest through the use of interest rate swap agreements.

Net Earnings

The Company reported net earnings for 2002 of
$424 million, $1.99 per share, compared to
$293 million, $1.38 per share in 2001. Results for 2002
include the write-down of indefinite lived intangible assets as
a cumulative effect of accounting change, which reduced net
earnings $43 million after tax. Results for 2001 include a
provision to account for the settlement of the New Orleans tank
car fire litigation, which reduced net earnings by
$37 million after tax. Excluding the cumulative effect of
the accounting change and the New Orleans litigation provision,
net earnings were $467 million for 2002, compared with
$330 million for 2001. This increase is the result of
increased operating income on a consolidated basis of
$110 million (excluding the pretax charge of
$60 million in 2001 for the New Orleans litigation
provision), higher other income of $32 million and lower
interest expense of $73 million.

Rail

vs. 2002

Operating
Revenue

CSX categorizes rail revenues in three main areas:

1. Merchandise, which includes the following
markets:

•

Phosphates and Fertilizers

•

Metals

•

Forest and Industrial

•

Agricultural and Food

•

Chemicals

•

Emerging Markets

2. Automotive

3. Coal, Coke and Iron Ore

Merchandise
Revenue

Merchandise showed strength during 2003 with
revenue up 5% on 4% volume growth. All markets showed
year-over-year revenue improvement, and all except phosphates
and fertilizers experienced increased volumes. Emerging markets
realized the most improvement, with 18% revenue growth on 12%
volume growth. Aggregates and cement traffic grew faster than
average industry growth rates due to new industrial development
and increased conversion of truck traffic to rail. Ammunition
volumes increased throughout the year and strength continued in
waste markets. The metals sector also showed strength in 2003.
Revenue improved 8% on 9% volume growth, driven by strong global
steel demand, particularly for scrap and sheet steel. Other
factors contributing to improvement include strength in
semi-finish metals and continued increases in modal conversions.
Demand for building products, lumber and paper products resulted
in an increase in forest and industrial revenue of 5% on 2%
volume growth. The agricultural and food and chemical sectors
also realized revenue increases, while volumes remained
consistent with 2002. Phosphates and fertilizers revenues
increased slightly year-over-year despite decreased volume, due
to domestic phosphates and ammonia strength.

Automotive
Revenue

Volume declined largely due to a 200,000 unit
year-over-year decrease in North American light vehicle
production. Haul extensions and price increases drove
improvements in revenue per car.

Coal,
Coke and Iron Ore Revenue

Coal, coke and iron ore volumes and revenue
remained consistent with results in the prior year. Export moves
were strong due to high European steam coal demand for
electricity generation. Steel related traffic was weak
throughout the year, but showed renewed strength during the
fourth quarter due to consolidation in the steel industry and
shifts in scrap metal demands that resulted in increased traffic
and revenue for CSX. Utility revenue was favorable due to
pricing initiatives and higher average length of haul.
Improvements in these areas were offset by abnormally harsh
winter weather during the first quarter which adversely affected
lake loadings, as lakes were frozen.


Operating
Expense

Total rail operating expenses increased
$492 million, or 10% in 2003 as compared to 2002. Increases
in most expense categories were somewhat offset by decreases in
building and equipment rent.

The primary component of the expense increase was
a charge of $229 million recorded in conjunction with the
Company’s change in estimate for its casualty reserves to
include an estimate of incurred but not reported claims for
asbestos and other occupational injuries that could be received
over the next seven years. This charge is reflected as
“Provision for Casualty Claims” in the financial
statements. (See Note 10, Casualty, Environmental and Other
Reserves.)

Labor and fringe expense remained relatively
consistent year-over-year. The cost of labor inflation was
offset by December-over-December reductions in staff of
approximately 1,200 and the favorable impact of the absence of a
management bonus in 2003, as approximately $45 million of
such expense was recorded in 2002.

Materials, supplies and other expenses increased
$117 million, or 10%, year-over-year. One of the primary
drivers was approximately $80 million of increased cost for
personal injury and related safety issues. An additional
$20 million of the expense deterioration is due to
increased cost of derailments. Additionally, due to the adoption
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” as
discussed below, depreciation expense has been decreased and
materials, supplies and other increased to account for the
discontinuation of the accrual of cross-tie removal as a
component of depreciation expense. The remaining increase
results from volume increases, inflationary effects and general
operational inefficiencies.

Conrail rents, fees & services expense
increased $20 million in 2003, as compared to the prior
year, as a result of increased usage of Shared Asset Areas, a
contractual increase in the rental fee for Shared Area
facilities, and a favorable tax adjustment in the prior year.
(See Note 2, Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations
With Conrail.)

Building and equipment rent decreased
$7 million in 2003 compared to the prior year principally
as a result of reduced car rentals from other railroads.

Inland transportation, which represents
CSXI’s use of the CSXT rail networks, remained relatively
consistent year-over-year. The offsetting expense associated
with this amount is reflected in CSXI’s operating expense,
and thus eliminates on a Surface Transportation level.

Depreciation remained consistent year-over-year.
The rail segment had capital additions of approximately
$1 billion, but the additional depreciation was offset by
the reduction in depreciation associated with the adoption of
SFAS 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.” In conjunction with the group-life method of
accounting for asset costs, the Company historically accrued
crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation, which is
not permitted under SFAS 143. The effect is to decrease
depreciation expense and increase material, supplies and other
expense.

Fuel expense increased $117 million in 2003,
as compared to the prior year. The expense increase is primarily
due to $102 million in fuel price increases, while
increased volumes were also a factor. The average price per
gallon of fuel was 96 cents per gallon for 2003 compared to 78
cents per gallon for 2002. In order to minimize future exposure
to fuel price fluctuation risk, during 2003 the Company entered
into a series of swaps in order to fix the price of a portion of
its estimated future fuel purchases. As of December 26,
2003, 18% and 21% of 2004 and 2005, respectively, estimated fuel
purchases were hedged. Fuel swaps did not have an effect on fuel
expense for the year ended December 26, 2003.

The net $22 million restructuring charge in
2003 represents the cost of CSX’s reorganization charges
offset by reductions in 1991/1992 separation reserves. (See Note
4, Restructuring.)


Operating
Income

Operating income decreased $313 million to
$541 million in 2003, compared to $854 million in 2002
primarily due to the $229 million provision for casualty
claims, the $22 million net restructuring charge and other
expense increases as previously discussed. Excluding the
provision for casualty claims and net restructuring charge,
operating income would have been $792 million.

vs. 2001

Operating
Revenue

Overall rail revenues were down $79 million
to $6.0 billion in 2002, with increases in merchandise and
automotive revenues being offset by lower coal revenues.
CSX’s pricing programs and product mix helped overcome a 3%
decrease in carloads in 2002.

Merchandise
Revenue

Overall merchandise revenues were up 1%, or
$47 million in 2002 over 2001. Improvements in phosphates
and fertilizers, chemicals, emerging markets, metals and paper
and forest products more than offset decreases in minerals,
agricultural products and food and consumer products. Pricing
programs and favorable mix helped the Company offset the effect
of a small decrease in merchandise carloads in 2002 as compared
to 2001.

Automotive
Revenue

Automotive revenues improved 6%, or
$51 million in 2002 as a result of yield improvement driven
by favorable mix and extended linehauls. Year-over-year volume
increases were driven by higher light truck production levels
and aggressive manufacturer incentives that stimulated
automobile sales during 2002.

Coal,
Coke and Iron Ore Revenue

Coal revenues had a significant impact on the
rail segment’s 2002 financial results. Coal revenue was
down 9%, or $143 million from 2001’s strong
performance due to reduced volumes. Export carloads were down
significantly as a result of the reduced competitive standing of
U.S. coal in the international market, while metallurgical and
industrial markets were down in the second half of 2002.

Other
Revenue

Other revenue decreased $35 million in 2002
as compared to 2001 primarily because there were lower fuel
surcharges billed to customers.

Operating
Expense

Total rail operating expenses decreased
$190 million, or 4% in 2002 as compared to 2001. Reductions
in most expense categories were somewhat offset by increases in
depreciation and reduced intercompany volume with CSX
Intermodal. Also, 2001 included $60 million relating to the
New Orleans litigation settlement. Fuel costs decreased
$76 million in 2002, of which $69 million is
attributable to lower fuel prices. The net impact on operating
income of reduced fuel price was $44 million since
$25 million of fuel surcharge revenue was discontinued.

Labor and fringe costs decreased $44 million
year-over-year including savings from reductions in overall
employment. These savings were offset by increased labor costs
relating to cost of living wage increases. Employee count was
approximately 950 lower at the end of 2002 as compared to 2001.


Building and equipment costs were down
$17 million mainly due to continued reduction in car hire
as the railroad took cars offline and ran more efficiently.

Conrail operating fees, rents and services
decreased $14 million in 2002 as compared to 2001.
Decreased costs in operating the shared asset areas, tax
settlements, efficiency improvements and adjustments to reflect
lower reserve requirements for car hire, overcharges, interline
and other claims all reduced this expense.

Materials, supplies and other costs at the rail
unit were down $11 million in 2002, as compared to 2001,
due to reduced transportation costs, fewer accidents and
adjustments to estimated state and local tax liabilities to
reflect actual assessments. These decreases were offset by
higher legal fees and maintenance costs, and $40 million in
favorable insurance settlements received in 2001 that were not
repeated in 2002.

Depreciation expense increased $26 million
as compared to 2001, as a result of a higher depreciable asset
base.

Operating
Income

Rail operating income increased by
$111 million to $854 million in 2002 as compared to
2001, due to operating expense decreases noted previously and
the New Orleans litigation provision. Excluding the 2001 charge
for the New Orleans litigation provision, operating income was
up $51 million or 6% for the year.

Intermodal

vs. 2002

CSX Intermodal domestic revenue improved 13% on
8% volume increase due to increased unloading and loading
(“transloading”) of international containers into
domestic containers and new programs. Strength in truck
brokerage continued due to the rollout of the new Pegasus
information management system, which provides real-time
information regarding driver availability and location, service
quality tracking and financial performance. The parcel sector
also showed year-over-year strength. International strength in
general import growth was partially offset by continued
international import/export diversions of freight carried
entirely via water routes from west coast ports to east coast
ports. These diversions have resulted in volume declines,
shorter hauls and lower per-unit revenue.

Intermodal operating expense increased
$108 million compared to the prior year. The increase is
due primarily to traffic mix and inflationary factors.
Additionally, the Company recognized a $15 million positive
contract settlement in 2002. Operating income decreased to
$110 million in 2003, compared to $141 million in the prior
year.

vs. 2001

CSXI reported operating revenue of
$1.2 billion in 2002, as compared to $1.1 billion in
2001. The increase was primarily due to continued success in
efforts to convert truck traffic onto the intermodal network.

CSXI operating expense increased $31 million
in 2002. This increase was the result of $32 million in
higher inland transportation costs due to increased volumes
handled during 2002. Also, due to volume increases, building and
equipment rent increased $8 million, and materials,
supplies and other increased $6 million. The increase was
partially offset by a $15 million positive contract
settlement. Other costs were relatively flat year-over-year.

CSXI operating income was up $37 million in
2002 as compared to 2001, due to the $68 million increase
in revenues, offset by a $31 million increase in operating
expenses. These results were also impacted by the
$15 million positive contract settlement noted above.


International
Terminals

vs. 2002

CSXWT’s revenue decreased $10 million,
or 4% to $226 million for 2003, compared to
$236 million in the prior year, primarily due to weakness
in the Hong Kong market. Expense decreased to $157 million
for the year, compared to $167 million for 2002, partially
attributable to reduced labor and fringe costs associated with
reduced volume at its Hong Kong operations and a $6 million
gain related to the divestiture of a portion of the Caucedo
terminal ownership interest, which offset other miscellaneous
expenses in 2002. Operating income remained consistent at
$69 million in 2003 and 2002.

During 2003, a significant customer of CSXWT
announced that it would terminate its marine terminal services
contract during the first quarter of 2004. This is expected to
negatively impact CSXWT’s 2004 operating income by
approximately $29 million and cash flow by approximately
$21 million. In December 2004, another contract is
scheduled to expire. Negotiations are in process to maintain
this contract, but if negotiations are unsuccessful, 2005
operating income may be negatively impacted by $20 million.
CSXWT expects that it will be able to replace all or
substantially all of the lost volume with new customers
representing long and short-term commercial commitments.
However, due to the increased competitive pressures, it is
possible that the profit margins achieved in the past will not
be realized in the near term. Under the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” companies are required to
review their assets for potential impairment losses if there are
certain impairment indicators present. Given these indicators,
the Company evaluated the undiscounted cash flows estimated to
be generated by this terminal, whose long-lived assets are
recorded at $59 million, and concluded that the forecasted
future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the book value of the
assets; therefore no impairment write-down is necessary at this
time.

vs. 2001

CSX World Terminals’ operating revenues were
flat at $236 million in 2002 and 2001. Operating expenses
were up $2 million in 2002 over 2001 due to lower earnings
from equity investments. Miscellaneous operating expenses in
2002 and 2001 include $6 million and $3 million gains,
respectively, from transactions relating to equity investments.
Operating income was $69 million for 2002, a $2 million
decrease from $71 million in 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Operating
Activities

Cash provided by operations for 2003 was
$804 million, compared to $1.1 billion for 2002, and
$827 million in 2001. The $323 million decrease in
2003, as compared to the prior year, reflects the
$380 million termination of the accounts receivable
facility. (See Note 8, Accounts Receivable). Excluding that,
cash provided by operating activities was slightly higher than
2002, at $1.2 billion. Real estate activities contributed
$122 million to operating cash flow, as compared to
$137 million provided in 2002.

In 2002 cash provided from operations was
$1.1 billion, a $300 million increase over 2001.
Higher operating income, lower interest expense and significant
cash flow relating to real estate activities contributed to the
increase, while there was a $85 million negative effect
attributable to the New Orleans tank car fire settlement payment.

Investing
Activities

Net cash used by investing activities was
$807 million in 2003 compared to $775 million in 2002
and $965 million in 2001. While 2003 capital expenditures
approximated 2002 levels,


reduced proceeds from maturities of short-term
investments led to the increase in cash used for investing
activities. Proceeds of $214 million from the sale of CSX
Lines in the first quarter of 2003 (See Note 3, Divestitures)
helped to offset the impact of reduced short-term investment
proceeds.

Property additions totaled $1.1 billion in
2003 and 2002 and $930 million in 2001. The 2003 and 2002
increases over 2001 were related to replacement of cars and
locomotives. Of Surface Transportation’s $1 billion in
2003 capital expenditures, substantially all related to
replacing track, locomotives and other costs necessary to
maintain the Company’s rail system. 2004 capital
expenditures are expected to be approximately $1 billion.

Financing
Activities

Financing activities provided cash of
$172 million during 2003 and $15 million in 2001, compared
to a $362 million use of cash during 2002. In 2003, net
issuances of $419 million in long-term debt were
principally used to repay short-term obligations incurred as a
result of the termination of the Company’s accounts
receivable sales program.

Debt
Issuances and Credit Facilities

In December 2003, CSX executed a $75 million
revolving loan facility that matures in 2005. Borrowings under
the facility will bear interest at a rate that fluctuates with
LIBOR. In addition, the Company pays an annual commitment fee of
0.15% for the period the facility is not drawn. This debt may be
redeemed at any time after May 2004, with additional borrowings
allowed through the maturity of the facility. As of
December 26, 2003, the Company had $75 million in
aggregate principal amount outstanding under this borrowing.

In November 2003, CSX issued $200 million
aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Notes due 2014
and $200 million aggregate principal amount of the
Company’s Notes due 2006. The 2014 Notes bear interest at
the rate of 5.30% per year and mature on February 15, 2014.
The 2006 Notes bear interest at the rate of 2.75% per year and
mature on February 15, 2006. The 2014 Notes may be redeemed
by the Company at any time, but the 2006 Notes cannot be
redeemed before maturity.

In August 2003, the Company issued
$300 million aggregate principal amount Notes due 2013.
These Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.50% and mature on
August 1, 2013. The Notes may be redeemed by the Company at
any time.

CSX increased its borrowings from Conrail by
approximately $144 million year-over-year in 2003 in
addition to the $146 million increase in 2002. Also, during
2002 the Conrail note was extended to a five year term.

During 2002, CSX issued $200 million of
4.88% notes due in 2009 and $400 million of 6.30% notes due in
2012.

The Company has a $1 billion five-year
revolving credit facility and a $345 million 364-day
revolving credit facility. Generally, these facilities may be
used to support the Company’s commercial paper, working
capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the 364-day
facility, the Company pays an annual fee to the participating
banks of .125% of total commitment. Under the five-year
facility, the Company pays annual fees to the participating
banks that may range from 0.08% to 0.23% of total commitment,
depending on the Company’s credit rating. As of
December 26, 2003, the Company had no borrowings
outstanding under these facilities and there were no commercial
paper borrowings outstanding. CSX had commercial paper
borrowings supported by these credit facilities of approximately
$140 million at the end of 2002.


Debt Repayments

CSX repaid long-term debt of $500 million in
2003, $1.2 billion in 2002, and $266 million in 2001.
The Company also paid a net $141 million in short-term debt
during 2003. The primary sources of 2003 repayments were the
$214 million of proceeds from the conveyance of CSX Lines
(see Note 3, Divestitures) and the issuance of new debt.

Long-term and short-term debt at
December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, totaled
$7.3 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. The ratio
of debt to total capitalization was 51% at the end of 2003, and
52% at the end of 2002 and 2001.

Convertible Debentures

In October 2001, CSX issued $564 million
aggregate principal amount at maturity in unsubordinated zero
coupon convertible debentures (the “debentures”) due
October 30, 2021 for an initial offering price of
approximately $462 million. At December 26, 2003 and
December 27, 2002, outstanding debentures are included in
long-term debt, at a carrying value of $447 million and
$467 million, respectively. These debentures accrete
(increase) in value at a yield to maturity of 1% per year.
The accretion rate may be reset on October 30, 2007,
October 30, 2011, and October 30, 2016 to a rate based
on five-year United States Treasury Notes minus 2.8%. In no
event, however, will the yield to maturity be reset below 1% or
above 3% per annum. Accretion in value on the debentures is
recorded for each period, but will not be paid prior to maturity.

Under the terms of the debentures, holders had
the option to require the Company to purchase their debentures
at a purchase price equal to the accreted value of the
debentures in October 2003. CSX purchased $15 million
aggregate principal amount at maturity of the debentures at an
aggregate cost of $13 million. In November 2003, the Company
made a one-time cash payment of $23.00 per $1,000 aggregate
principal amount at maturity to holders who did not require the
Company to purchase their debentures. This resulted in a $13
million cash payment, which will be amortized over the remaining
term of the debentures. In addition, the terms of the debentures
were amended to permit holders to cause the Company to purchase
the debentures on October 30, 2005, at their accreted value
of $852.48 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, in addition
to the purchase dates provided under the terms of the
debentures. Similarly, the debentures allow holders to require
the Company to purchase their debentures in October 2006,
October 2008, October 2011, and October 2016, at a purchase
price equal to the accreted value of the debentures. In 2005,
2006 and 2008, CSX may elect to pay the purchase price in cash
and/or shares of common stock, while CSX may pay the purchase
price only in cash on the last two purchase dates. CSX may
redeem the debentures for cash at any time on or after
October 30, 2008, at a redemption price equal to the
accreted value of the debentures.

Holders may convert debentures into CSX common
stock if certain requirements defined in the debentures and the
related indenture are met. Holders may convert if the closing
sale price of CSX common stock for at least 20 of the 30
preceding trading days is more than the applicable percentage
(which is initially 120% and will decline over the life of the
debentures to 110%) of the accreted conversion price per share
of the Company’s common stock. The “accreted
conversion price” per share of common stock is the quotient
of the accreted value of a debenture divided by the number of
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of that
debenture. Holders may also convert if the Company’s senior
long-term unsecured credit ratings are downgraded by
Moody’s Investors Service Inc. to below Ba1 and by Standard
& Poor’s Rating Services to below BB+, if the
debentures have been called for redemption, if the Company makes
specified distributions to holders of CSX common stock, or if
the company is a party to specified consolidations, mergers, or
transfers or leases of all or substantially all of the
Company’s assets. For each debenture surrendered for
conversion, a holder will initially receive 17.75 shares of CSX
common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price
of $46.16


per share. The initial conversion rate will be
adjusted for reasons specified in the indenture, but will not be
adjusted for accretion. Instead, accretion on the debentures
will be deemed paid by the common stock received by the holder
on conversion.

Shelf Registration Statements

CSX has $600 million of remaining capacity
under a shelf registration that may be used, subject to market
conditions, to issue debt or other securities at the
Company’s discretion. The Company presently intends to use
the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under its
shelf registration statements to finance cash requirements,
including refinancing existing debt as it matures. While the
Company seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to meeting
such needs, there can be no assurance that market conditions
would permit the Company to sell such securities on acceptable
terms at any given time, or at all.

Dividends

In mid-year 2001, the board of directors
announced that the regular quarterly dividend payable would be
reduced to 10 cents per share. CSX had paid a regular quarterly
dividend of 30 cents per share since the fourth quarter of 1997
and did so through June of 2001. Dividends paid in 2003, 2002
and 2001 were as follows:

Working Capital

The Company’s working capital deficit at
December 26, 2003, was $307 million, as compared to
$665 million at December 27, 2002. A working capital
deficit is not unusual for the Company and other companies in
the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The
Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy
current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due
and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its day-to-day
cash requirements and any obligations arising from legal, tax
and other regulatory rulings.

Credit Ratings

As of December 26, 2003, CSX
Corporation’s long-term unsecured debt obligations were
rated BBB and Baa2 by Standard and Poor’s and by
Moody’s Investor Service, respectively. In the event
CSX’s long-term unsecured bond ratings were reduced to BBB-
and Baa3, the Company’s drawn and undrawn borrowing costs
under the $1.0 billion and $345 million revolving
credit facilities would not materially increase. However, at
year-end 2003, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under
these credit facilities. The Company’s short-term
commercial paper program is rated A-2 and P-2 by Standard and
Poor’s and Moody’s Investor Service, respectively.
Should these ratings decline to A-3 and P-3, the company’s
cost and access to the commercial paper markets could be
adversely affected. At year-end 2003, the Company had no
commercial paper borrowings outstanding.


Schedule of Contractual Obligations and
Commercial Commitments

The following table sets forth maturities of the
Company’s contractual obligations:

The following table sets forth the maturities of
the Company’s other commitments:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements,
except as noted above, that are reasonably likely to have an
effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Market Risk

CSX addresses market risk exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its
fuel costs through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes.

The Company addresses its exposure to interest
rate market risk through a controlled program of risk management
that includes the use of interest rate swap agreements. As of
December 26, 2003, the Company had various interest rate
swap agreements on $1.3 billion of its outstanding notes
payable. In the event of a 1% increase or decrease in the LIBOR
interest rate, the interest expense related to these agreements
would increase or decrease approximately $13 million on an
annual basis.


During 2003, the Company began a program to hedge
its exposure to fuel price volatility through swap transactions.
As of December 26, 2003, CSX has hedged approximately 18%
and 21% of expected requirements for 2004 and 2005,
respectively. The Company expects that by the end of 2004 the
programs will result in an increase in the amount of fuel hedged
to approximately 76% of 2005 annual purchases. At
December 26, 2003, a 1% change in fuel prices would result
in an increase or decrease in the asset related to the swaps of
approximately $1 million. The Company is subject to risk
relating to changes in the price of diesel fuel. At the end of
2003, the Company had not entered into any long-term commitments
for forward fuel purchases. The Company’s rail unit average
annual fuel consumption is approximately 570 million
gallons. A one-cent change in the price per gallon of fuel would
impact fuel expense by approximately $6 million.

The Company is exposed to loss in the event of
non-performance by any counter-party to the interest rate swap
or fuel hedging agreements. The Company does not anticipate
non-performance by such counter-parties, and no material loss
would be expected from non-performance.

Exclusive of derivative contracts that swap fixed
rate notes to floating interest rates, at December 26, 2003
and December 27, 2002, CSX had approximately
$714 million and $709 million, respectively, of
floating rate debt outstanding. A 1% variance in interest rates
would on average effect annual interest expense by approximately
$7 million.

While the Company’s international terminals
segment does business in several foreign countries, a
substantial portion of its revenue and expenses are transacted
in U.S. dollars, or currencies with little fluctuation against
the U.S. dollar. For this reason, CSX does not believe its
foreign currency market risk is significant.

A substantial increase in the fair market value
of the Company’s stock price could negatively impact
earnings per share due to the dilutive effect of stock options
and convertible debt.

Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations
with Conrail

See background, accounting and financial
reporting effects and summary financial information in Note 2,
Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail.

Conrail’s Results of
    Operations

2003 vs. 2002

Conrail Inc. (“Conrail”) reported net
income of $203 million in 2003, which included a cumulative
effect of accounting change benefit of $40 million.
Excluding the cumulative effect of accounting change, net income
was $163 million, as compared with $180 million in
2002. Operating revenues were up $25 million to
$918 million from the prior year. However, operating
expenses were up 6% to $659 million.

In June 2003, CSX, Norfolk Southern Corporation
(“NS”) and Conrail jointly filed a petition with the
Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) to establish
direct ownership and control by CSX’s and NS’
respective subsidiaries, CSX Transportation Inc.
(“CSXT”) and Norfolk Southern Railway
(“NSR”) of their portions of the Conrail system
already operated by them separately and independently under
various agreements. These portions of the Conrail system are
currently owned by Conrail’s subsidiaries, New York Central
Lines LLC (“NYC”) and Pennsylvania Lines LLC
(“PRR”). The ownership of NYC and PRR would be
transferred (“spun off”) to CSXT and NSR,
respectively. Conrail would continue to own, manage and operate
the Shared Asset Areas as previously approved by the STB. STB
approval to proceed with the spin-off transaction and a
favorable ruling from the IRS qualifying the


transaction as a non-taxable disposition were
received in November 2003. The transaction remains subject to a
number of other conditions.

If all necessary conditions are satisfied,
unsecured debt securities of newly formed subsidiaries of CSXT
and NSR would be offered in a 42%/58% ratio in exchange for
Conrail’s unsecured debentures. The debt securities issued
by its respective subsidiary would be fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by CSXT or NSR. Upon completion of the proposed
transaction, the subsidiaries would be merged into CSXT and NSR,
respectively, and the new debt securities thus would become
direct unsecured obligations of CSXT or NSR. Conrail’s
secured debt and lease obligations will remain obligations of
Conrail and are expected to be supported by new leases and
subleases which, upon completion of the proposed transaction,
would be the direct lease and sublease obligations, also on a
42%/58% ratio, of CSXT and NSR. CSX will record the proposed
transaction at fair value based on the results of an independent
valuation of NYC, with any difference from carrying value
resulting in a gain or loss. The Company can not predict the
outcome of the valuation and the impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

CSX, NS and Conrail are working to complete the
spin-off transaction in 2004. Upon consummation of the proposed
transaction, CSX’s investment in Conrail will no longer
include the amounts related to NYC and PRR. Instead the assets
and liabilities of NYC will be reflected in their respective
line items in CSX’s consolidated balance sheet. Conrail
will continue to own, manage and operate the Shared Asset Areas.

2002 vs. 2001

Conrail reported net income of $180 million
in 2002, compared with $174 million in 2001. Operating revenues
were down $10 million to $893 million in 2002, while
operating expenses were favorable $16 million
year-over-year. Lower costs in the Shared Asset Areas, tax
settlements and lower reserve requirements for car hire,
overcharges, interline and other claims helped improve 2002
results.

Financial Condition and
    Liquidity

Conrail’s operating activities provided cash
of $412 million in 2003, compared with $423 million in
2002 and $502 million in 2001. The decrease in cash
provided by operations in 2003 is a result of decreased
operating income. The decrease in cash provided by operations in
2002 compared to 2001 reflected large payments of casualty
claims. Cash generated from operations is the principal source
of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and
capital expenditures.

Debt repayments totaled $57 million,
$59 million and $61 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Capital expenditures were $35 million, $23
million and $47 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Total cash used for financing activities was
$360 million, most of which results from an increase in the
amount receivable from CSX and Norfolk Southern under their
respective notes (See Note 2, Investment In and Integrated Rail
Operations with Conrail).

Conrail had working capital deficits of
$22 million and $29 million at December 26, 2003
and December 27, 2002, respectively. A working capital
deficit is not unusual for the Company and does not indicate a
lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate
current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing
obligations when they come due and has sufficient financial
capacity to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any
obligations arising from legal, tax and other regulatory rulings.

Divestitures

In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its
interest in its domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX
Lines LLC (“CSX Lines”), to a new venture formed with
the Carlyle Group for approximately $300 million (gross
cash proceeds of approximately $240 million,
$214 million net of transaction costs, and $60 million
of securities). CSX Lines was subsequently renamed


Horizon Lines LLC (“Horizon”). Horizon
has subleased equipment and/or assigned vessel leases from
certain affiliates of CSX covering the primary financial
obligations related to $300 million of leases under which
CSX or one of its affiliates will remain a lessee/ sublessor or
guarantor. A deferred pretax gain of approximately
$127 million as a result of the transaction will be
recognized over the 12-year sub-lease term. Approximately
$9 million of this gain was recognized during 2003. The
securities have a term of 7 years and a preferred return
feature. During the third quarter, CSX received a
$15 million payment from Horizon Lines, which included
$3 million of interest, in return of a portion of its
investment in Horizon and now holds $48 million of
securities.

Other Matters

Matters Arising out of Sale of
International Container-Shipping Assets

In 2003, CSX finalized a settlement agreement
with Maersk resolving all remaining material disputes pending
directly between the two companies, consisting predominantly of
two major disputes. The first dispute involved a post-closing
working capital adjustment to the sale price for which the
Company had recorded a receivable of approximately
$70 million. The second dispute involved a claim of
425 million Dutch Guilders (approximately $180 million
at then prevailing currency exchange rates) plus interest by
Europe Container Terminals BV (“ECT”) alleging
breaches of contract by the Company at the Rotterdam container
terminal facility owned by ECT.

Also in 2003, CSX entered into a final settlement
agreement with Maersk allocating responsibility between the two
companies for third party claims and litigation relating to the
assets acquired by Maersk.

The two settlements reduced the Company’s
2003 earnings by $108 million pretax, $67 million
after tax. This charge is reflected in the financial statements
as an additional loss on the sale of the international
container-shipping assets. Neither settlement has a material
impact on cash flows.

Restructuring

In November 2003, the Company announced a
management restructuring plan to streamline the structure at a
number of its companies, eliminate organizational layers and
realign certain functions. The initiative will reduce the
non-union workforce by 800 to 1,000 positions over the last
quarter of 2003 and the first half of 2004. As of
December 26, 2003, 20 employees have been terminated under
this program. The Company recorded an initial charge related to
this reduction of $34 million pretax, in 2003, to record
the lowest amount of expense to be incurred under this program.
The total estimated cost of the program is expected to be in the
range of $60 million to $80 million. The majority of
separation benefits will be paid from CSX’s qualified
pension plans, with the remainder being paid from general
corporate funds.

Also in 2003, the Company recorded a
$10 million restructuring charge related to another
workforce reduction program. Substantially all of this amount
had been paid out at December 27, 2003.

In 2003, the Company recorded a $22 million
pretax credit related to a favorable change in estimate related
to the 1991 and 1992 separation plans. These plans provided for
workforce reductions, improvements in productivity and other
cost reductions. The reduction in estimate for these plans
results from lower railroad retirement taxes and other benefits
than had been built into the initial $1.3 billion charge.

A net $22 million restructuring charge was
recorded representing the cost of the restructuring initiatives
offset by reductions in 1991/1992 separation reserves. The
associated expense is included in operating expense on the
Income Statement as “Restructuring Charge —
Net.”


Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires that management make estimates in
reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of certain
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
using management judgment are made for the following areas:

1. Casualty, legal and environmental reserves

2. Pension and postretirement medical plan
    accounting

3. Depreciation policies for its assets
    under the group-life method

These estimates and assumptions are discussed
with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular
basis.

1.     Casualty,
Legal and Environmental Reserves

Casualty
Reserve Management

Casualty reserves represent accruals for the
uninsured portion of occupational injury and personal injury
claims. These reserves are recorded upon the first reporting of
a claim, and estimates are updated as information develops. The
amount of liability accrued is based on the type and severity of
the claim, and an estimate of future claims development based on
current trends and historical data. The Company believes it has
recorded liabilities in sufficient amounts to cover all
identified claims and estimates of incurred but not reported
personal injury claims for the next seven years. During 2003,
the Company retained third party professionals to work with it
to project the number of asbestos and other occupational injury
claims to be received over the next seven years and the related
costs. Based on this analysis the Company established reserves
for the probable and reasonably estimable asbestos and other
occupational injury liabilities. Other occupational claims
include allegations of exposure to certain materials in the work
place, such as solvents and diesel fuel, or alleged physical
injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or hearing loss. In
conjunction with the change in estimate, in 2003 the Company
recorded a charge of $206 million to increase its provision
for these claims. Approximately $141 million of this amount
relates to asbestos claims. Additionally, the provision for
personal injury claims was increased by $26 million as a
result of a change in estimate.

Estimates for all of these claims are subject to
significant uncertainty relating to the outcomes of negotiated
settlements and other developments and are not suited to
subjecting to a sensitivity analysis. As facts and circumstances
change, the Company may have to change its estimates, and
changes could have a material impact on the Company’s
financial results. Events such as adverse verdicts, catastrophic
accidents and legal settlements will cause the Company to revise
its estimated liabilities, which the Company reviews and
appropriately adjusts quarterly. Personal and occupational
injury liabilities amount to $864 million and
$605 million at December 26, 2003 and
December 27, 2002, respectively. (See Note 10,
Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves).

Legal
Reserves

In accordance with SFAS 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies,” an accrual for a loss contingency is
established if information available prior to issuance of the
financial statements indicates that it is (1) probable that
an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at
the date of the financial statements, and (2) the amount of
loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a
loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not
met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount
accrued, disclosure of the


contingency is made when there is at least a
reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may
have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating
to legal liabilities on an ongoing basis and records reserves
when appropriate under the guidance noted above.

In 2003, CSX finalized a settlement agreement
with Maersk resolving all remaining material disputes pending
directly between the two companies, consisting predominantly of
two major disputes. The two settlements reduced the
Company’s 2003 earnings by $108 million pretax,
$67 million after tax. This charge is reflected in the
financial statements as an additional loss on the sale of the
international container-shipping assets. Neither settlement has
a material impact on cash flows.

In 2001 Duke Energy Corporation
(“Duke”) filed a complaint before the U.S. Surface
Transportation Board alleging that certain CSXT common carrier
coal rates are unreasonably high. In February 2004, the STB
issued a decision finding that the CSXT common carrier rates
were reasonable. While approving the rate levels, the STB also
invited Duke to request a phase-in of rate increases over some
time period. The nature and amount of any such phase-in is
uncertain, and would only apply to billings subsequent to
December 2001. CSXT will continue to consider and pursue all
available legal defenses in this matter. Administrative and
legal appeals are possible, and could take several years to
resolve. An unfavorable outcome to this complaint would not have
a material effect on the Company.

The Company increased a reserve in 2001 to
account for the impact of the negotiated settlement of the New
Orleans tank car fire. This negotiation resulted in the Company
recording an additional charge of $60 million pretax,
$37 million after tax in 2001.

Environmental
Management

CSXT is a party to various proceedings, including
administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private
parties and regulatory agencies related to environmental issues.
CSXT has been identified as a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) at approximately 260 environmentally impaired
sites, many of which are, or may be, subject to remedial action
under the Federal Superfund statute (“Superfund”) or
similar state statutes. A number of these proceedings are based
on allegations that CSXT, or its railroad predecessors, sent
hazardous substances to the facilities in question for disposal.
Some of the proceedings involve property formerly or currently
owned by CSXT or its railroad predecessors. Proceedings arising
under Superfund or similar state statutes can involve numerous
other companies who generated the waste or owned or operated the
property and involve the allocation of liability for costs
associated with site investigation and cleanup, which could be
substantial.

At least once each quarter, CSXT reviews its role
with respect to each such location, giving consideration to a
number of factors, including:

Based on the review process, CSXT has recorded
reserves to cover estimated contingent future environmental
costs with respect to such sites. The recorded liabilities for
estimated future environmental costs at December 26, 2003,
and December 27, 2002 were $45 million and


$35 million, respectively. These
liabilities, which are undiscounted, include amounts
representing CSXT’s estimate of unasserted claims, which
CSXT believes to be immaterial. The liability includes future
costs for all sites where the Company’s obligation is
(1) deemed probable and (2) can be reasonably
estimated. The liability includes future costs for remediation
and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing
monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance
recoveries. During 2003, the Company increased its estimate for
environmental liabilities by a net $10 million due to
continuing evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve. The
majority of the December 26, 2003 environmental liability
is expected to be paid out over the next seven years.

The Company does not currently possess sufficient
information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional
liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future
environmental studies. Also, changes in federal and state laws
and regulations may impact, favorably or unfavorably, the effort
required to remediate sites. In addition, latent conditions at
any given location could result in exposure, the amount and
materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated.
Based upon information currently available, however, the Company
believes its environmental reserves are adequate to accomplish
remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations,
and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will
not materially affect its overall results of operations and
financial condition.

2.     Pension
and Postretirement Medical Plan Accounting

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension
plans, principally for salaried personnel. The plans provide
eligible employees with retirement benefits based principally on
years of service and compensation rates near retirement. In
addition to the defined benefit pension plans, the Company
sponsors three plans that provide medical and life insurance
benefits to most full-time salaried employees upon their
retirement. The postretirement medical plans are contributory
(partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions
adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non-contributory.
The benefit obligation for these plans represents the liability
of the Company for current and retired employees and is affected
primarily by the following:

Plan assets are amounts that have been segregated
and restricted to provide benefits, and include amounts
contributed by the Company and amounts earned from investing
contributions, less benefits paid. The pension plans are funded
at not less than the minimum funding standards set forth in the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Plan assets
consist primarily of common stocks, corporate bonds and cash and
cash equivalents. The Company funds the cost of the
postretirement medical and life insurance benefits on a
pay-as-you-go basis. The accounting for these plans is subject
to the guidance provided in SFAS No. 87, “Employers
Accounting for Pensions,” and SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other than Pensions.” Both of these statements require that
management make certain assumptions relating to the following:


All of these assumptions and estimates can have a
significant impact on the Company’s accounting for these
plans and the amount of expense recorded in a reporting period.
These assumptions are made as of the beginning of the year. The
Company uses a plan year of Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 to
value its pension and postretirement plans on an actuarial
basis. As permitted by SFAS 87, the Company has elected to use
this fiscal year as it provides for more timely analysis. The
Company engages third-party actuaries to compute the amounts of
liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the
assumptions that the Company selects for its plans. The Company
reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes
modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and
trends when appropriate. Additionally, as CSX expects a
curtailment (event that impacts the future service, and
therefore benefits, to be earned by employees under the plan),
to occur in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the
Management Restructuring, and accordingly, will review actuarial
assumptions as required by SFAS 88 and SFAS 106. The
impact of the curtailment is expected to be immaterial.
Currently, the Company does not expect any significant changes
to its assumptions.

Long-term
Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected return on the Company’s pension
plan assets is based on the Company’s expectation of the
long-term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds
(based on a composite yield of AA-rated corporate bonds), which
is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the
funds. As this estimate is long-term, it is not adjusted as
frequently as other assumptions used in pension accounting.
However, the impact of the last few years’ overall market
returns did cause CSX to reevaluate the rate used in calculating
its liability at September 30, 2002 (the end of the
measurement period for 2002) and adjust it from 9.5% to 8.9%.
This change will increase the amount of pension expense reported
in future periods. The Company evaluated the investment
performance during 2003 as well as future expectations and
determined that an adjustment to the long-term rate of return is
not warranted. CSX will continue to evaluate its performance on
an ongoing basis and if appropriate will adjust the long-term
rate of return. A 1% change in the rate of return assumption
would change pension expense by $15 million.

Discount
Rates

Discount rates are based on comparable rates for
long-term liabilities that reflect a similar time horizon to
payments that the Company will make for pension and
postretirement medical payments. These rates are analyzed every
year and adjusted accordingly. As such, management has minimal
discretion with respect to the discount rates used. The discount
rate impacts the amount of liability recorded and also the
amount of the interest expense component of pension and
postretirement expense. CSX’s assumed discount rates used
in calculating the liability at September 30, 2003 and
September 30, 2002, respectively, were 6.0% and 6.5% for
the pension liabilities and 5.0% and 5.5% for postretirement
medical benefits. The difference between the rate used for
pension vs. postretirement is due to the different time horizon
of future payments.

Salary
Scale Inflation

Salary scale inflation rates are based on current
trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The
Company reviews this assumption on a regular basis and makes
adjustments when appropriate. CSX lowered this rate from 4.5% in
2001 to 3.3% for 2002 and 2003.

Health
Care Cost Trend Rates

The health care cost trend rate is based on
current trends and historical data. Due to the increasing costs
of providing health care benefits, the Company increased the
inflation assumption for health care costs for the 2002 year. No
changes were deemed necessary to the health care cost trend rate
in 2003. The current assumed rate is 11% decreasing gradually
until


reaching 4.5% in 2012. A 1% change in the health
care cost trend rate assumption would effect expense by
$2 million.

Summary
Pension Assumptions

Other
Assumptions Relating to Pensions and Postretirement
Benefits

The calculations made by the actuaries also
include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover, and
retirement age. These assumptions are based on historical data
and are approved by management. As a result of changes in
assumptions for fiscal year 2004, net periodic pension benefit
cost and postretirement benefit costs for 2004 are expected to
increase approximately $7 million.

In December 2003, the President of the United
States signed into law the “Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (“the
Act”), which introduces a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare Part D as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS 106
requires that changes in the law that take effect in the future
and affect future benefit coverage shall be considered in
current-period benefit measurements. However, as significant
uncertainties exist for how to account for the subsidy a plan
sponsor may not have sufficient information available to measure
effects of the Act, prepare related actuarial valuations, and
ensure proper accounting. Therefore, FASB has issued staff
position No. FAS 106-1 which allows a plan sponsor to
elect to defer recognizing the effects of the Act until
authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy
is issued, or until certain other events occur. When the
guidance is issued, it may cause CSX to revise previously
reported information. CSX is currently evaluating how this
legislation may impact its postretirement benefit plans. (See
Note 17, “Employee Benefit Plans.”)

3.     Depreciation
Policies Under the Group-Life Method

The Company accounts for its rail assets,
including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using
the group-life method. This method pools similar assets by road
and equipment type and then depreciates each group as a whole.
These assets represent 94% of the Company’s total fixed
assets and amounted to $12.9 billion on a net basis at
December 26, 2003. Under the group-life method, the useful
lives of rail assets are determined by the performance of a
life-study which includes:


The results of the life study process determine
the service lives for each asset group. These studies are
conducted by a third party expert and analyzed by the
Company’s management. Changes in asset lives due to the
results of the life studies could significantly impact future
periods depreciation expense and thus the Company’s results
of operations. Events that could cause the Company to change its
estimates relating to the lives of its asset groups could be
changes in historical results, technological improvements and
changes in specific assets. In 2003, the Company completed life
studies for all of its rail assets. The effect of theses studies
was to increase the average useful lives on its equipment and
track assets, while decreasing the average useful lives on many
of the roadway assets. These changes in average useful lives of
the assets will have minimal net reduction on depreciation
expense in the future. As a result, the net increase in
depreciation expense was $1 million in 2003, while the
impact will be a decrease of approximately $13 million in
2004 and thereafter.

Additionally, with the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” in 2003,
CSX recorded pretax income of $93 million, $57 million
after tax as a cumulative effect of an accounting change,
representing the reversal of the accrued liability for crosstie
removal costs. On an ongoing basis, depreciation expense will be
reduced, while labor and fringe and materials, supplies and
other expense will be increased by approximately
$12 million annually.

In 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee (AcSEC) of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants voted to approve the Statement of Position
(SOP) Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities related
to Property, Plant and Equipment and presented it to the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for approval.
If the FASB causes the SOP to be applicable, certain costs and
activities that are currently capitalized may require immediate
recognition and alternatively, some costs and activities that
are currently expensed may require capitalization. In addition,
the SOP will require additional refinement in asset
componentization, potentially altering the amount of
depreciation expense recognized. While the Company is evaluating
the proposal, it has not yet determined what effect it may have
if passed by the FASB. However, the effect could be material.

New Accounting Pronouncements and Change In
Accounting Policy

SFAS 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” was issued in 2001. This statement
addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. In
conjunction with the group-life method of accounting for asset
costs, the Company historically accrued crosstie removal costs
as a component of depreciation, which is not permitted under
SFAS 143. As noted above, with the adoption of
SFAS 143 in fiscal year 2003, CSX recorded pretax income of
$93 million, $57 million after tax as a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, representing the reversal of the
accrued liability for crosstie removal costs. The adoption of
SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on prior reporting
periods, and the Company does not believe it will have a
material effect on future earnings. On an ongoing basis,
depreciation expense will be reduced, while labor and fringe and
materials, supplies and other expense will be increased by
approximately $12 million annually.

SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure” was
issued in December 2002. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide
alternative methods of transition to Statement 123’s
fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and require disclosure of the effects of an
entity’s accounting policy with respect to stock-based
employee compensation. Effective beginning with fiscal year
2003, CSX has voluntarily adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” and adopted the disclosure requirements of
SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure —
an amendment of SFAS 123.” In accordance with the
prospective method of


adoption permitted under SFAS 148,
stock-based awards issued subsequent to fiscal year 2002 are
accounted for under the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS 123 utilizing the Black-Scholes valuation method and,
accordingly, are expensed. (See Note 15, Stock Plans.)

In 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which
requires a variable interest entity (“VIE”) to be
consolidated by a company that is subject to a majority of the
risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities
or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s
residual returns, or both. Interpretation No. 46 also
requires disclosures about VIEs that the company is not required
to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable
interest. Also in 2003, Interpretation 46
(“46R”), a revision to FASB Interpretation No. 46
was issued, to clarify some of the provisions of, and to exempt
certain entities from Interpretation 46 requirements. Under
the new guidance, CSX will consolidate Four Rivers
Transportation, Inc. (“FRT”), a shortline railroad,
into its financial statements at the beginning of fiscal 2004.
Presently, FRT is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. The adoption of Interpretation No. 46 will not
have a material impact on results of operations in future
reporting periods.

In 2002, the FASB issued Financial Accounting
Standard Interpretation (“FASI”) No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” This statement requires that certain guarantees be
recorded at fair value on the statement of financial position
and additional disclosures be made about guarantees. CSX did not
realize a financial statement impact with the adoption of the
accounting provisions of this statement in fiscal year 2003 and
does not anticipate a future impact. (See Note 18,
Commitments and Contingencies.)

In 2001, SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”, was issued. Under the provisions of
SFAS 142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible
assets are no longer amortized, but are reviewed for impairment
on a periodic basis. The Company adopted this standard for
fiscal 2002, and incurred a pretax charge of $83 million,
$43 million after tax and minority interest as a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, which represents the difference
between book value and the fair value of indefinite lived
intangible assets. These indefinite lived intangible assets are
permits and licenses that the Company holds relating to a
proposed pipeline to transfer natural gas from Alaska’s
North Slope to the port in Valdez, Alaska. The fair value was
determined using a discount method of projected future cash
flows relating to these assets. The carrying value of these
assets is now approximately $3 million. The adoption of
SFAS 142 did not have a material effect on prior reporting
periods, and the Company does not believe it will have a
material effect on future earnings. The Company does not have
any other significant indefinite lived intangible assets.

In 2002, SFAS 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” was issued.
This statement requires that long-lived assets to be disposed of
by sale are no longer measured on a net realizable value basis,
and future operating losses are no longer recognized before they
occur. In addition, this statement modifies the reporting
requirements for discontinued operations. Long-lived assets,
whether to be held for disposition or held and used, should be
measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less
cost to dispose. The Company applied the provisions of this
statement relating to the accounting for the conveyance of its
wholly-owned subsidiary, CSX Lines, to a third party in 2003
(See Note 3, Divestitures). In addition, another of the
Company’s subsidiaries, CSX World Terminals, was notified
of a significant customer loss for 2004 and possible customer
loss for 2005. Given these indicators, the Company evaluated the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by this
terminal, whose long-lived assets are recorded at
$59 million and concluded that the forecasted future
undiscounted cash flows exceeded the book value of its
long-lived assets, therefore no impairment write-down is
necessary at this time.


Regulation and Legislation

Rail operations are subject to the regulatory
jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board
(“STB”) of the United States Department of
Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Railroad
Administration of DOT and other state and regulatory agencies.
The regulation and legislation passed by these organization can
significantly affect the costs and profitability of the
Company’s business.

In response to the heightened threat of terrorism
in the wake of the September 2001 attacks on the World
Trade Center, Pentagon and airline infrastructure, federal,
state and local regulatory agencies are evaluating various
proposals with respect to the transportation industry. Some of
these proposals relate to the transport of hazardous material.
Certain metropolitan areas considered at high risk for a
terrorist attack may be the subject of future regulation. The
ultimate legislation passed by federal, state and local
regulators related to issues of security has the potential to
severely affect CSX’s operations and costs.

Factors Expected to Influence 2004

During the upcoming year, there are several key
areas which continue to affect the operations and profitability
of CSX. Management believes that the Company must remain focused
on improving the efficiency of its rail network, reducing its
operating expense and restoring higher service levels. General
economic factors, including the cost of fuel, may also influence
2004 operating results.

Improving operating efficiency in Surface
Transportation while maintaining volume is critical to success
in lowering the operating ratio, and in turn improving financial
performance. To do so, management believes that CSX must
optimize its network routing, including a reduction in both
gross ton miles and the number of times a car is handled or
switched en route to the final destination. CSX is utilizing
internal and external consultants to assist with the network
optimization effort.

Fuel represents a significant expense of CSX
Surface Transportation operations and was a factor in 2003
expense increases. Fuel prices can vary significantly from
period to period and significantly impact future results.
Although CSX has implemented a fuel price hedging program, it
will remain subject to fuel price fluctuations for the majority
of 2004 fuel purchases. Approximately 18% of 2004 fuel purchases
are currently hedged at an average cost of 70 cents per gallon,
exclusive of taxes and transportation costs. Each month, the
Company is systematically increasing its hedged amount so that
in July of 2005, 76% of the estimated fuel purchases should be
hedged for a 24 month period.

CSX faces inherent business risk of exposure to
property damage and personal injury claims in the event of train
accidents, including derailments. The Company is also subject to
exposure to occupational injury claims. While CSX is working
diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to
raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety,
the Company cannot ensure that it will not experience any
material property damage, personal or occupational claims in the
future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend
such claims. Additionally, the Company cannot ensure that
existing claims will not suffer adverse development not
currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate
outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors which
are outside of CSX’s control. CSX engages outside parties
to assist with the evaluation of certain of the occupational and
personal injury claims, and believes that it is adequately
reserved to cover all potential claims. However, final amounts
determined to be due to any outstanding matters may differ
materially from the recorded reserves.

The ability of the Company to effectively
implement the management restructuring will be an important
factor in future success. Once complete, the organization of the
Company should be conducive to enhanced accountability, faster,
more reliable communication, better decision


making and a more competitive cost structure.
Executing the restructuring while minimizing the impact of the
possible disruption associated with the elimination of a
significant portion of the Company’s existing management
will be critical to the Company’s short-term success.

The ability of the Company to replace, in both
the long and short-term, the business lost due to competitive
pressures in the Hong Kong terminals market will have a direct
impact on the profitability of the Company’s International
Terminals segment. While management is diligently working to
attract new customers, there can be no guarantee that new
customers will be gained. Also, it is likely that the margins
experienced in the past at the Company’s Hong Kong terminal
operations will not continue for the near term, even if the lost
volume is replaced. The International Terminals segment’s
revenue and operating income represented approximately 3% and
11% of the Company’s consolidated revenues and operating
income, respectively for 2003.

CSX CORPORATION

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP,
INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of CSX
Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of CSX Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
changes in shareholders’ equity for each of the three
fiscal years in the period ended December 26, 2003. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of CSX Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 26, 2003 and December 27,
2002, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended December 26, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, in 2003 the Company changed its method of
accounting for railroad tie removal costs and stock-based
compensation, and in 2002 the Company changed its method of
accounting for indefinite lived intangible assets.

Nature of Operations and Significant
    Accounting Policies

Nature of
Operations

CSX Corporation, including its majority-owned
subsidiaries (collectively, “CSX” or
“Company”), is a freight transportation company with
principal business units providing rail, intermodal and
international terminal services.

•

Rail transportation services are provided
    principally throughout the Eastern United States and accounted
    for 79% of the Company’s 2003 operating revenue.

•

Intermodal services are provided through a
    dedicated network of terminals and facilities across North
    America and accounted for 16% of operating revenue in 2003.

•

International terminal operations are located in
    Asia, Europe, Australia and Latin America and accounted for 3%
    of operating revenues in 2003.

In 2003, CSX conveyed most of its interest in its
domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines LLC (“CSX
Lines”), to a new venture formed with the Carlyle Group for
approximately $300 million (gross cash proceeds of
approximately $240 million, $214 million net of
transaction costs and $60 million of securities). (See
Note 3, Divestitures.)

Rail shipments include merchandise, automotive
products and coal, coke and iron ore. Service groups as a
percent of rail revenue are as follows:

Merchandise traffic includes the following
markets:

• Phosphates and Fertilizer

• Agricultural and Food

• Metals

• Chemicals

• Forest and Industrial

• Emerging Markets

Coal shipments originate mainly from mining
locations in the Eastern United States and primarily supply
domestic utility and export markets.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include CSX
and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in companies that are not majority-owned are carried
at cost (if less than 20% owned and the Company has no
significant influence) or equity (if the Company has significant
influence).

Fiscal Year

CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting
calendar. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 consisted of
52 weeks. A 52-week fiscal year has four 13-week quarters.
A 53-week year occurs periodically with the next one occurring
in 2004. Fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001 ended on:

•

December 26, 2003

•

December 27, 2002

•

December 28, 2001

Earnings Per
Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by
dividing income available to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Earnings per share, assuming dilution, starts with the
basic calculation described above and adjusts the denominator
for the effect of potential dilution of common shares during the
period, mainly from employee stock options. This difference
increases the denominator for the additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if these shares had been issued.
Potentially dilutive common shares at CSX include stock options
and awards, and shares that would be issued relating to
convertible long-term debt. References to earnings per share in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements assume dilution.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and
Short-term Investments

On a daily basis, cash in excess of current
operating requirements is invested in various highly liquid
investments having a maturity of three months or less at the
date of acquisition. These investments are carried at cost,
which approximates market value, and are classified as cash
equivalents.

Materials and
Supplies

Materials and supplies consist primarily of fuel
and items for replacement and maintenance of track and
equipment, and are carried at average cost.

Properties

All properties are stated at cost less an
allowance for accumulated depreciation. Rail assets, including
main-line track, locomotives and freight cars are depreciated
using the group-life method. This method pools similar assets by
road and equipment type and then depreciates each group as a
whole. These assets represent approximately 94% of the
Company’s total fixed assets and amounted to
$12.9 billion on a net basis at December 26, 2003. The
majority of other property is depreciated using the
straight-line method on a per asset basis.

Regulations enforced by the Surface
Transportation Board (“STB”) of the U.S. Department of
Transportation require periodic formal studies of ultimate
service lives for all railroad assets, which include:


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The results of the life study process determine
the service lives for each asset group under the group-life
method. These studies are conducted by a third party expert and
analyzed by the Company’s management. Resulting service
life estimates are subject to review and approval by the STB.
Road assets, including main-line track, have estimated service
lives ranging from 5 (system roadway machinery) to 80
(grading) years. Equipment assets, including locomotives
and freight cars, have estimated service lives ranging from 6
(vehicles) to 29 (work equipment) years.

Changes in asset lives due to the results of the
life studies could significantly impact future periods
depreciation expense and thus the Company’s results of
operations. Events that could cause the Company to change its
estimates relating to the lives of its asset groups could be
changes in historical results, technological improvements and
changes in specific assets. The Company completed life studies
on road, track and equipment in 2003 and has partially reflected
the results in its 2003 financial statements. As a result, the
net increase in depreciation expense was $1 million in
2003, while the impact will be a decrease of approximately
$13 million in 2004 and thereafter.

For retirements or disposals of depreciable rail
assets that occur in the ordinary course of business, the asset
cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to
accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. For
retirements or disposals of non-rail depreciable assets,
infrequent disposal of rail assets outside the normal course of
business and for all dispositions of land, the resulting gains
or losses are recognized at the time of disposal. Expenditures
that significantly increase asset values or extend useful lives
are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures are charged
to operating expense when the work is performed.

Properties and other long-lived assets are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or business conditions
indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully
recoverable. Initial assessments of recoverability are based on
estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows associated with
an asset or a group of assets in accordance with SFAS 144.
Where impairment is indicated, the assets are evaluated, and
their carrying amount is reduced to fair value based on
undiscounted net cash flows or other estimates of fair value.

The FASB is currently considering the proposed
Statement of Position (SOP), “Accounting for Certain Costs
and Activities related to Property, Plant and Equipment” If
this SOP is issued, certain costs and activities that are
currently capitalized may require immediate expense recognition
and alternatively, some costs and activities that are currently
expensed may require capitalization. In addition, the SOP would
require additional refinement in asset componentization.
potentially altering the amount of depreciation expense
recognized. The Company is currently evaluating the potential
impact on the financial statements, but is not yet in a position
to determine what effect it may have if passed by the FASB.
However, the effect could be material.

Revenue and Expense
Recognition

Surface Transportation (rail and intermodal)
revenue and expense are recognized proportionately as freight
moves from origin to destination. Prior to the conveyance of CSX
Lines in 2003, container-shipping revenue, and a corresponding
accrual for the estimated cost to complete delivery, was
recorded when cargo first sailed from its port of origin.
International Terminals revenue and expense are recognized when
vessels depart from the terminal. All other revenue is recorded
upon completion of service.


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Casualty Reserves

Casualty reserves represent accruals for the
uninsured portion of occupational injury and personal injury
claims. These reserves are recorded upon the first reporting of
a claim, and estimates are updated as information develops. The
amount of liability accrued is based on the type and severity of
the claim and an estimate of future claims development based on
current trends and historical data. The Company believes it has
recorded liabilities in sufficient amounts to cover all
identified claims and estimates of incurred but not reported
personal injury and accident claims. In 2003, the Company
changed its estimate of casualty reserves to also include an
estimate of incurred but not reported claims for asbestos and
other occupational injuries to be received over the next seven
years. Other occupational claims include allegations of exposure
to certain materials in the work place, such as solvents and
diesel fuel, or alleged physical injuries, such as carpal tunnel
syndrome or hearing loss. In conjunction with the change in
estimate, in 2003 the Company recorded a charge of
$206 million to increase its provision for these claims.
Approximately $141 million of this amount relates to
asbestos claims. Additionally, the provision for personal injury
claims was increased by $26 million as a result of a change in
estimate.

Personal and occupational injury liabilities
amount to $864 million and $605 million at
December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively.

Environmental
Costs

The Company incurs costs for environmental
corrective efforts, such as the study and clean-up of
environmental contamination. Environmental costs are charged to
expense when they relate to an existing condition caused by past
operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue
generation. Liabilities for environmental corrective efforts are
recorded when CSX’s responsibility is (1) deemed
probable and (2) the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Generally, the timing of these accruals coincides with the
completion of a feasibility study or the Company’s
commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental reserves at
December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002 were
$45 million and $35 million, respectively.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Effective beginning with fiscal year 2003, CSX
voluntarily adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” and adopted the disclosure requirements of
SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure —
an amendment of SFAS 123.” In accordance with the
prospective method of adoption permitted under SFAS 148,
the Company has adopted the fair value recognition provisions on
a prospective basis and accordingly, expense of $5 million
was recognized in the year ended December 26, 2003 for
stock options granted in May 2003. Additionally, $3 million
of other stock-based compensation was recorded pursuant to other
stock compensation arrangements, but was offset by an expense
reversal related to a retirement. The following table sets forth
net earnings and the pro-forma computation of basic earnings per
share and earnings per


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

share, assuming dilution had stock compensation
expense been determined based on the fair values of stock awards
at the date of grant:

Comprehensive
Earnings

CSX reports comprehensive earnings (loss) in
accordance with SFAS 130, “Reporting Comprehensive
Income,” in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in
Shareholders’ Equity. Comprehensive earnings is defined as
all changes in shareholders’ equity during a period, other
than those resulting from investments by and distributions to
shareholders (i.e. issuance of equity securities and dividends).
Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 26, 2003
and December 27, 2002 consists primarily of minimum pension
liabilities.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

The Company recognizes all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and
measures those instruments at fair value.

Interest
Rate Swaps

The Company has entered into several interest
rate swaps as part of its program to address interest rate
market risk exposure. CSX’s interest rate swaps are
designated and qualify as fair value hedges under SFAS 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” For derivative instruments that are designated
and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gains and losses on the
derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized
in current earnings during the period of change in fair values.
If the change in the value of the hedging instrument offsets the
change in the value of the hedged item, the hedge is considered
perfectly effective. The accounting for hedge effectiveness is
measured at least quarterly based on the relative change in fair
value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over
time. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness,
the amount by which the change in the value of the hedge does
not exactly offset the change in the value of the hedged item,
is recognized immediately in earnings. The Company’s
interest rate swaps qualify as perfectly effective fair value
hedges. As such, there is


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

no ineffective portion to the hedge recognized in
earnings. Adjustments to the fair value of the interest rate
swap agreements are recorded in other assets and other
liabilities.

The differential to be paid or received under
these agreements is accrued consistently with the terms of the
agreements and is recognized in interest expense over the term
of the related debt. The related amounts payable to or
receivable from counterparties are included in other liabilities
or assets. Cash flows related to interest rate swap agreements
are classified as “Operating activities” in the Cash
Flow Statement.

Fuel
Hedging

In 2003, CSX began a program to hedge a portion
of its 2004 and 2005 locomotive fuel purchases. In order to
minimize exposure to fuel price fluctuation risk, the Company
has entered into a series of swaps in order to fix the price of
a portion of its estimated future fuel purchases.

The program limits fuel hedges to a 24-month
duration and a maximum of 80% of CSX’s average monthly fuel
purchased for any month within the 24-month period, and places
the hedges among selected counterparties. Fuel hedging activity
did not have an effect on fuel expense for the year ended
December 26, 2003. Ineffectiveness, or the extent to which
changes in the fair values of the fuel swaps did not offset
changes in the fair values of the expected fuel purchases, is
recorded in fuel expense and is immaterial.

These instruments qualify, and are designated by
management, as cash-flow hedges of variability in expected
future cash flows attributable to fluctuations in fuel prices.
The fair values of fuel derivative instruments are determined
based upon quoted market prices and are recorded on the balance
sheet with offsetting adjustments to Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income, a component of Shareholders’ Equity.
This amount was approximately $6 million as of
December 26, 2003. Fair value adjustments are noncash
transactions, and accordingly, are excluded from the Cash Flow
Statement.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by other parties to interest rate swap
and fuel hedge agreements. However, the Company does not
anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
(“SFAS”) 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” was issued in 2001. This statement
addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. In
conjunction with the group-life method of accounting for asset
costs, the Company historically accrued crosstie removal costs
as a component of depreciation, which is not permitted under
SFAS 143. With the adoption of SFAS 143 in fiscal year
2003, CSX recorded pretax income of $93 million,
$57 million after tax as a cumulative effect of an
accounting change, representing the reversal of the accrued
liability for crosstie removal costs. The adoption of
SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on prior reporting
periods, and the Company does not believe it will have a
material effect on future earnings. On an ongoing basis,
depreciation expense will be reduced, while labor and fringe and
materials, supplies and other expense will be increased by
approximately $12 million annually.

SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure” was
issued in December 2002. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide
alternative methods of transition to Statement 123’s fair
value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation
and require disclosure of the effects of an


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

entity’s accounting policy with respect to
stock-based employee compensation. Effective beginning with
fiscal year 2003, CSX has voluntarily adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” and adopted the disclosure
requirements of SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure —
an amendment of SFAS 123.” In accordance with the
prospective method of adoption permitted under SFAS 148,
stock-based awards issued subsequent to fiscal year 2002 are
accounted for under the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS 123 utilizing the Black-Scholes valuation method and,
accordingly, are expensed. (See Note 15, Stock Plans.)

In 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,”
requires a variable interest entity (“VIE”) to be
consolidated by a company that is subject to a majority of the
risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities
or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s
residual returns, or both. Interpretation No. 46 also
requires disclosures about VIEs that the company is not required
to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable
interest. Also in 2003, Interpretation 46
(“46R”), a revision to FASB Interpretation
No. 46, to clarify some of the provisions of, and to exempt
certain entities from Interpretation 46 requirements. Under
the new guidance, CSX will consolidate Four Rivers
Transportation, Inc. (“FRT”), a short-line railroad,
into its financial statements beginning December 27, 2003.
Presently, FRT is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. The adoption of Interpretation No. 46 will not
have a material impact on future reporting periods.

In 2002, the FASB issued Financial Accounting
Standard Interpretation (“FASI”) No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” This statement requires that certain guarantees be
recorded at fair value on the statement of financial position
and additional disclosures be made about guarantees. CSX adopted
the accounting provisions of this statement in fiscal year 2003.
(See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies.)

In 2001, SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”, was issued. Under the provisions of
SFAS 142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible
assets are no longer amortized, but are reviewed for impairment
on a periodic basis. The Company adopted this standard for
fiscal 2002, and incurred a pretax charge of $83 million,
$43 million after tax and minority interest as a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, which represents the difference
between book value and the fair value of indefinite lived
intangible assets. These indefinite lived intangible assets are
permits and licenses that the Company holds relating to a
proposed pipeline to transfer natural gas from Alaska’s
North Slope to the port in Valdez, Alaska. The fair value was
determined using a discount method of projected future cash
flows relating to these assets. The carrying value of these
assets is now approximately $3 million. The adoption of
SFAS 142 did not have a material effect on prior reporting
periods, and the Company does not believe it will have a
material effect on future earnings. The Company does not have
any other significant indefinite lived intangible assets.

In 2002, SFAS 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” was issued.
This statement requires that long-lived assets to be disposed of
by sale are no longer measured on a net realizable value basis,
and future operating losses are no longer recognized before they
occur. In addition, this statement modifies the reporting
requirements for discontinued operations. Long-lived assets,
whether to be held for disposition or held and used, should be
measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less
cost to dispose. The Company applied the provisions of this
statement relating to the accounting for the conveyance of its
wholly-owned subsidiary, CSX Lines, to a third party in 2003
(See Note 3, Divestitures). In


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

addition, another of the Company’s
subsidiaries, CSX World Terminals, was notified of a significant
customer loss for 2004 and possible customer loss for 2005.
Given these indicators, the Company evaluated the undiscounted
cash flows estimated to be generated by this terminal, whose
long-lived assets are recorded at $59 million and concluded
that the forecasted future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the
book value of its long-lived assets, therefore no impairment
write-down is necessary at this time.

Prior-year Data

Certain prior-year data has been reclassified to
conform to the 2003 presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires that management make estimates in
reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of certain
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting
estimates using management judgment are made for the following
areas:

1.

Casualty, legal and environmental reserves

2.

Pension and postretirement medical plan accounting

3.

Depreciation polices for its assets under the
    group-life method

Note
2.     Investment In and Integrated
Rail Operations with Conrail

Background

CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation
(“Norfolk Southern”) acquired Conrail Inc.
(“Conrail”) in May 1997. Conrail owns the primary
freight railroad system serving the Northeastern United States,
and its rail network extends throughout several Midwestern
states and into Canada. CSX and Norfolk Southern, through a
jointly owned acquisition entity, hold economic interests in
Conrail of 42% and 58%, respectively, and voting interests of
50% each. CSX and Norfolk Southern operate over allocated
portions of the Conrail lines.

The rail subsidiaries of CSX and Norfolk Southern
each operate separate portions of the Conrail system pursuant to
various operating agreements. Under these agreements, the
railroads pay operating fees to Conrail for the use of
right-of-way and rent for the use of equipment. Conrail
continues to provide rail services in certain shared geographic
areas (“Shared Asset Areas”) for the joint benefit of
CSX and Norfolk Southern, for which it is compensated on the
basis of usage by the respective railroads.

In June 2003, CSX, Norfolk Southern Corporation
(“NS”) and Conrail jointly filed a petition with the
Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) to establish
direct ownership and control by CSX’s and NS’
respective subsidiaries, CSX Transportation Inc.
(“CSXT”) and Norfolk Southern Railway
(“NSR”) of their portions of the Conrail system
already operated by them separately and independently under
various agreements. These portions of the Conrail system are
currently owned by Conrail’s subsidiaries, New York Central
Lines (“NYC”) and Pennsylvania Lines LLC
(“PRR”). The ownership of NYC and PRR would be
transferred (“spun off”) to CSXT and NSR,
respectively. Conrail would continue to own, manage and operate
the Shared Asset Areas as previously approved by the STB. STB
approval to proceed with the spin-off transaction and a

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

favorable ruling from the IRS qualifying the
transaction as a non-taxable disposition were received in
November 2003. The transaction remains subject to a number of
other conditions.

If all necessary conditions are satisfied,
unsecured debt securities of newly formed subsidiaries of CSXT
and NSR would be offered in a 42%/58% ratio in exchange for
Conrail’s unsecured debentures. The debt securities issued
by its respective subsidiary would be fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by CSXT or NSR. Upon completion of the proposed
transaction, the subsidiaries would be merged into CSXT and NSR,
respectively, and the new debt securities thus would become
direct unsecured obligations of CSXT or NSR. Conrail’s
secured debt and lease obligations will remain obligations of
Conrail and are expected to be supported by new leases and
subleases which, upon completion of the proposed transaction,
would be the direct lease and sublease obligations, also on a
42%/58% ratio, of CSXT and NSR. CSX will record the proposed
transaction at fair value based on the results of an independent
valuation of NYC, with any difference from carrying value
resulting in a gain or loss. The Company can not predict the
outcome of the valuation and the impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

CSX, NSR and Conrail are working to complete all
necessary steps to consummate the spin-off transaction in 2004.
Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, CSX’s
investment in Conrail will no longer include the amounts related
to NYC and PRR. Instead the assets and liabilities or NYC will
be reflected in their respective line items in CSX’s
consolidated balance sheet. Conrail will continue to own, manage
and operate the Shared Asset Areas.

As listed below, CSX has amounts payable to
Conrail, representing expenses incurred under the operating,
equipment and shared area agreements with Conrail. Also, Conrail
advances its available cash balances to CSX and Norfolk Southern
under variable-rate notes, with CSX’s note maturing on
March 28, 2007.

The agreement under which CSXT operates its
allocated portion of the Conrail route system has an initial
term of 25 years and may be renewed at CSXT’s option

Operating fees paid to Conrail under the
agreement are subject to adjustment every six years based on the
fair value of the underlying system. Lease agreements for the
Conrail equipment operated by CSXT cover varying terms. CSXT is
responsible for all costs of operating, maintaining, and
improving the routes and equipment under these agreements.

On December 26, 2003, future minimum
payments to Conrail under the operating, equipment and shared
area agreements were as follows:

In the event of the consummation of the spin-off
transaction, the future minimum payments will be reduced.

Note 3. Divestitures

In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its
interest in its domestic container-shipping subsidiary, CSX
Lines LLC (“CSX Lines”), to a new venture formed with
the Carlyle Group for approximately $300 million (gross
cash proceeds of approximately $240 million,
$214 million net of transaction costs and $60 million
of securities). CSX Lines was subsequently renamed Horizon Lines
LLC (“Horizon”). Horizon has subleased vessel and
equipment from certain affiliates of CSX covering the primary
financial obligations related to $300 million of leases under
which CSX or one of its affiliates will remain a lessee/
sublessor or guarantor. A deferred pretax gain of approximately
$127 million as a result of the transaction will be
recognized over the 12-year sub-lease term. Approximately
$9 million of this gain was recognized in 2003. The
securities have a term of 7 years and a preferred return
feature. During the third quarter, CSX received a
$15 million payment from Horizon Lines, which included
$3 million of interest, in return of a portion of its
investment in Horizon and now holds $48 million of
securities.

Note 4. Restructuring

In November 2003, the Company announced a
management restructuring plan to streamline the structure at a
number of its companies, eliminate organizational layers and
realign certain functions. The initiative will reduce the
non-union workforce by 800 to 1,000 positions over the last
quarter of 2003 and the first half of 2004. As of
December 26, 2003, 20 employees have been terminated
under this program. The Company recorded an initial charge
related to this reduction of $34 million pretax, in 2003,
to record the lowest amount of expense to be incurred under this
program. The total estimated cost of the program is expected to
be in the range of $60 million to $80 million. The
majority of separation benefits will be paid from CSX’s
qualified pension plans, with the remainder being paid from
general corporate funds.

Also in 2003, the Company recorded a
$10 million restructuring charge related to another
workforce reduction program. Substantially all of this amount
had been paid out at December 26, 2003.


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In 2003, the Company recorded a $22 million
pretax credit related to a favorable change in estimate related
to the 1991 and 1992 separation plans. These plans provided for
workforce reductions, improvements in productivity and other
cost reductions. The reduction in estimate for these plans
results from lower railroad retirement taxes and other benefits
than had been built into the initial $1.3 billion charge.

A net $22 million restructuring charge was
recorded representing the cost of the restructuring initiatives
offset by reductions in 1991/1992 separation reserves. The
associated expense is included in operating expense on the
Income Statement as “Restructuring Charge —
Net.”

The Company has not recorded domestic deferred or
additional foreign income taxes related to undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be
indefinitely reinvested. These earnings amounted to $387
million, $341 million and $291 million at
December 26, 2003, December 27, 2002 and
December 28, 2001, respectively. These amounts may become
taxable upon their remittance as dividends or upon the sale or
liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries. It is not practical
to determine the amount of net additional income tax that may be
payable if such earnings were repatriated.

The Company files a consolidated federal income
tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries.
Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been
completed through 1993. Tax returns for 1994 through 2002
currently are under examination. Management believes adequate
provision has been made for any adjustments that might be
assessed.

The breakdown of income tax expense
(benefit) between current and deferred is as follows:

Income tax expense reconciled to the tax computed
at statutory rates is as follows:

The decrease in the effective income tax rate is
attributable to a larger portion of the Company’s earnings
being earned in foreign jurisdictions with statutory income tax
rates below the U.S. statutory income tax rate and the
cumulative impact of adjustments to the deferred effective state
income tax rate due to favorable state tax regulations.

Note 8. Accounts Receivable

Sale of
Accounts Receivable

During 2003, CSXT discontinued the sale of
accounts receivable, which resulted in a $380 million
increase in accounts receivable. Previously, CSXT sold, without
recourse, a revolving pool of accounts receivable to CSX Trade
Receivables Corporation (“CTRC”), a bankruptcy-remote
entity wholly-owned by CSX Corporation. CTRC transferred the
accounts receivable to a master trust and caused the trust to
issue multiple series of certificates representing undivided
interests in the receivables. The certificates issued by the
master trust were sold to investors, and the proceeds from those
sales were paid to CSXT.

Two series of certificates were outstanding as of
December 27, 2002. One series in the amount of
$300 million was sold to investors in 1998 and matured in
June 2003. A second series of $200 million was sold to a
private entity in 2000 and matured in June 2003 as well. As of
December 27, 2002, the amounts sold under the private and
public series were $80 million and $300 million
respectively. The amount retained in the master trust at
December 27, 2002 was $534 million. The fair value of
retained interests approximated book value as the receivables
were collected in approximately one month.

Net losses associated with the sale of
receivables are as follows:

CSXT retained responsibility for servicing
accounts receivables held by the master trust. The average
servicing period was approximately one month. No servicing asset
or liability was recorded since the fees CSXT received
approximated its related costs.

Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts based on the expected collectibility of all accounts
receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is included in
the balance sheet as follows:

The decrease in the allowance for doubtful
accounts is due to the write-off of uncollectible receivables
during 2003.

Other Reserves

Activity related to casualty, environmental and
other reserves is as follows:


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Reserve balances are as follows:

Casualty
Reserves

Casualty reserves represent accruals for the
uninsured portion of occupational injury and personal injury
claims. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company changed its
estimate of casualty reserves to include an estimate of incurred
but not reported claims for asbestos and other occupational
injuries to be received over the next seven years. Other
occupational claims include allegations of exposure to certain
materials in the work place, such as solvents and diesel fuel,
or alleged physical injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or
hearing loss.

In conjunction with the 2003 change in estimate,
the Company recorded a charge of $232 million to increase
its provision for casualty reserves. Approximately
$141 million relates to asbestos claims.

Asbestos
and Other Occupational Injuries

During 2003, the Company retained third party
professionals to work with it to project the number of asbestos
and other occupational injury claims to be received over the
next seven years and the related costs. Based on this analysis
the Company established reserves for the probable and reasonably
estimable asbestos and other occupational injury liabilities.

The methodology used by the third party to
project future occupational injury claims was based largely on
CSX’s recent experience, including claim-filing and
settlement rates, injury and disease mix, open claims and claim
settlement costs. However, projecting future occupational injury
claims and settlements costs is subject to numerous variables
that are difficult to predict. In addition to the significant
uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be
received, other variables, including the type and severity of
the injury or disease alleged by each claimant, the long latency
period associated with exposure, dismissal rates, costs of
medical treatment, uncertainties surrounding the litigation
process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case
and the impact of changes in legislative or judicial standards,
may cause actual results to differ significantly from estimates.
Furthermore, predictions with respect to these variables are
subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period
lengthens. In light of these uncertainties, CSX believes that
seven years is the most reasonable period for estimating future
claims, and that claims received after that period are not
reasonably estimable.

CSX increased its reserve for asbestos and other
occupational claims by a net $206 million to cover the
estimate of incurred but not reported claims to be filed during
the next seven years. Reflecting the additional provisions,
CSX’s reserve for asbestos and other occupational claims on


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

an undiscounted basis amounted to
$345 million at December 26, 2003, compared to
$171 million at December 27, 2002.

A summary of existing claims activity is as
follows:

Approximately 5,500 of the open claims above are
asbestos claims against the Company’s previously owned
international container-shipping business, Sea-Land. Because the
Sea-Land claims are claims against multiple vessel owners, the
Company’s reserves reflect its portion of those claims. The
remaining open claims have been asserted against CSX
Transportation. At December 26, 2003 and December 27,
2002, the Company had approximately $13 million and
$10 million reserved for the Sea-Land claims.

Estimates for these claims are subject to
significant uncertainty relating to the outcomes of negotiated
settlements and other developments. As facts and circumstances
change, the Company may have to change its estimates, and
changes could have a material impact on the Company’s
financial results. Such events as adverse verdicts, catastrophic
accidents and legal settlements will cause the Company to revise
its estimated liabilities, which the Company reviews and
appropriately adjusts quarterly.

Personal
Injury

During 2003, CSX retained an independent
actuarial firm to assess the value of CSX’s personal injury
portfolio. This firm’s methods and procedures yielded a
slightly higher valuation for personal injury claims than
previously recognized by CSX due to a higher estimated cost for
adverse development. Utilizing the analysis provided, CSX
increased its reserves for alleged personal injury claims by
$26 million.

Separation
Liability

Separation liabilities at December 26, 2003,
include productivity charges recorded in 1991 and 1992 to
provide for the estimated costs of implementing workforce
reductions, improvements in productivity and other cost
reductions at the Company’s major transportation units. The
remaining separation liabilities are expected to be paid out
over the next 15 to 20 years.

In 2003, the Company recorded a $22 million
pretax credit related to revised estimates for railroad
retirement taxes and the amount of benefits that will be paid to
individuals under the $1.3 billion charges initially
recorded in 1991 and 1992. This amount is netted with separation
expenses related to the 2003 Management Restructuring, as
discussed in Note 4.


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Environmental Reserves

CSXT is a party to various proceedings, including
administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private
parties and regulatory agencies related to environmental issues.
CSXT has been identified as a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) at approximately 260 environmentally impaired
sites, many of which are, or may be, subject to remedial action
under the Federal Superfund statute (“Superfund”) or
similar state statutes. A number of these proceedings are based
on allegations that CSXT, or its railroad predecessors, sent
hazardous substances to the facilities in question for disposal.
Some of the proceedings involve property formerly or currently
owned by CSXT or its railroad predecessors. Proceedings arising
under Superfund or similar state statutes can involve numerous
other companies who generated the waste or owned or operated the
property and involve the allocation of liability for costs
associated with site investigation and cleanup, which could be
substantial.

At least once each quarter, CSXT reviews its role
with respect to each such location, giving consideration to a
number of factors, including the type of cleanup required, the
nature of CSXT’s alleged connection to the location (e.g.,
generator of waste sent to the site, or owner or operator of the
site), the extent of CSXT’s alleged connection (e.g.,
volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant
factors), the accuracy and strength of evidence connecting CSXT
to the location, and the number, connection, and financial
viability of other named and unnamed PRP’s at the location.

Based on the review process, CSXT has recorded
reserves to cover estimated contingent future environmental
costs with respect to such sites. The recorded liabilities for
estimated future environmental costs at December 26, 2003,
and December 27, 2002 were $45 million and
$35 million, respectively. These liabilities, which are
undiscounted, include amounts representing CSXT’s estimate
of unasserted claims, which CSXT believes to be immaterial. The
liability includes future costs for all sites where the
Company’s obligation is (1) deemed probable and
(2) where such costs can be reasonably estimated. The
liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration
of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs,
but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. The majority
of the December 26, 2003 environmental liability is
expected to be paid out over the next seven years.

The Company does not currently possess sufficient
information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional
liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future
environmental studies. In addition, latent conditions at any
given location could result in exposure, the amount and
materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated.
Based upon information currently available, however, the Company
believes its environmental reserves are adequate to accomplish
remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations,
and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will
not materially affect its overall results of operations and
financial condition.

Note 11.     Debt and
Credit Agreements

Debt is as follows:

Debt
Issuances

In December 2003, CSX executed a $75 million
revolving loan that matures in 2005. Borrowings under the
facility will bear interest at a rate that fluctuates with
LIBOR. In addition, the Company pays an annual commitment fee of
0.15% for the period the facility is not drawn. This debt may be
redeemed at any time after May 2004, with additional borrowings
allowed through the maturity of the facility. As of
December 26, 2003, the Company had $75 million in aggregate
principal amount outstanding under this borrowing.

In November 2003, CSX issued $200 million
aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Notes due 2014
and $200 million aggregate principal amount of the
Company’s Notes due 2006. The 2014 Notes bear interest at
the rate of 5.30% per year and mature on February 15, 2014.
The 2006 Notes bear interest at the rate of 2.75% per year and
will mature on February 15, 2006. The 2014 Notes may be
redeemed by the Company at any time, but the 2006 Notes cannot
be redeemed before maturity.

CSX increased its borrowings from Conrail by
approximately $144 million year-over-year in 2003 in
addition to the $146 million increase in 2002. Also, during
2002 the Conrail note was extended to a five year term.

In August 2003, the Company issued
$300 million aggregate principal amount Notes due in 2013.
These Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.5% and mature on
August 1, 2013. The Notes may be redeemed by the Company at
any time.

During 2002, CSX issued $200 million of
4.88% notes due in 2009 and $400 million of 6.30% notes due
in 2012.

Credit
Facilities

The Company has a $1 billion five-year
revolving credit facility and a $345 million 364-day
revolving credit facility. Generally these facilities may be
used to support the Company’s


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

commercial paper, working capital and other
general corporate purposes. Under the 364-day facility, the
Company pays an annual fee to the participating banks of .125%
of total commitment. Under the five-year facility, the Company
pays annual fees to the participating banks that may range from
0.08% to 0.23% of total commitment, depending on the
Company’s credit rating. As of December 26, 2003, the
Company had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities.
CSX had commercial paper borrowings supported by these credit
facilities of $140 million at the end of 2002.

Convertible
Debentures

In October 2001, CSX issued $564 million
aggregate principal amount at maturity in unsubordinated zero
coupon convertible debentures (the “debentures”) due
October 30, 2021 for an initial offering price of
approximately $462 million. At December 26, 2003 and
December 27, 2002, outstanding debentures are included in
long-term debt, at a carrying value of $447 million and
$467 million, respectively. These debentures accrete in
value at a yield to maturity of 1% per year. The accretion rate
may be reset on October 30, 2007, October 30, 2011,
and October 30, 2016 to a rate based on five-year United
States Treasury Notes minus 2.8%. In no event, however, will the
yield to maturity be reset below 1% or above 3% per annum.
Accretion in value on the debentures is recorded for each
period, but will not be paid prior to maturity.

Under the terms of the debentures, holders had
the option to require the Company to purchase their debentures
at a purchase price equal to the accreted value of the
debentures in October 2003. CSX purchased $15 million
aggregate principal amount at maturity of the debentures at an
aggregate cost of $13 million. In November 2003, the Company
made a one-time cash payment of $23.00 per $1,000 aggregate
principal amount at maturity to holders who did not require the
Company to purchase their debentures. This resulted in a $13
million cash payment, which will be amortized over the remaining
term of the debentures. In addition, the terms of the debentures
were amended to permit holders to cause the Company to purchase
the debentures on October 30, 2005, at their accreted value
of $852.48 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, in addition
to the purchase dates provided under the terms of the
debentures. Similarly, the debentures allow holders to require
the Company to purchase their debentures in October 2006,
October 2008, October 2011, and October 2016, at a purchase
price equal to the accreted value of the debentures. In 2005,
2006 and 2008, CSX may elect to pay the purchase price in cash
and/or shares of common stock, while CSX may pay the purchase
price only in cash on the last two purchase dates. CSX may
redeem the debentures for cash at any time on or after
October 30, 2008, at a redemption price equal to the
accreted value of the debentures.

Holders may convert debentures into CSX common
stock if certain requirements defined in the debentures and the
related indenture are met. Holders may convert if the closing
sale price of CSX common stock for at least 20 of the 30
preceding trading days is more than the applicable percentage
(which is initially 120% and will decline over the life of the
debentures to 110%) of the accreted conversion price per share
of the Company’s common stock. The “accreted
conversion price” per share of common stock is the quotient
of the accreted value of a debenture divided by the number of
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of that
debenture. Holders may also convert if the Company’s senior
long-term unsecured credit ratings are downgraded by
Moody’s Investors Service Inc. to below Ba1 and by Standard
& Poor’s Rating Services to below BB+, if the
debentures have been called for redemption, if the Company makes
specified distributions to holders of CSX common stock, or if
the company is a party to specified consolidations, mergers, or
transfers or leases of all or substantially all of the
Company’s assets. For each debenture surrendered for
conversion, a holder will initially receive 17.75 shares of CSX
common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price
of $46.16


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

per share. The initial conversion rate will be
adjusted for reasons specified in the indenture, but will not be
adjusted for accretion. Instead, accretion on the debentures
will be deemed paid by the common stock received by the holder
on conversion.

Shelf
Registration Statements

CSX has $600 million of remaining capacity
under a shelf registration that may be used, subject to market
conditions, to issue debt or other securities at the
Company’s discretion. The Company presently intends to use
the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under its
shelf registration statements to finance cash requirements,
including refinancing existing debt as it matures. While the
Company seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to meeting
such needs, there can be no assurance that market conditions
would permit the Company to sell such securities on acceptable
terms at any given time, or at all.

Note
12.     Derivative Financial
Instruments

Interest Rate
Swaps

CSX has entered into various interest rate swap
agreements to hedge the fair value of the following fixed rate
notes:

Under these agreements, the Company will pay
variable interest based on LIBOR in exchange for a fixed rate,
effectively transforming the notes to floating rate obligations.
The instruments qualify, and are designated, as fair value
hedges.

The interest rate swap agreements are designated
and qualify as fair value hedges and the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on
the fixed rate note attributable to the hedged risk, are
recognized in current earnings during the period of change in
fair values. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly
based on the relative change in fair value of the derivative
contract in comparison with changes over time in the fair value
of the fixed rate notes. Any change in fair value resulting from
ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, “Accounting For
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” is
recognized immediately in earnings. The Company’s interest
rate swaps qualify as perfectly effective fair value hedges, as
defined by SFAS 133. As such, there was no ineffective portion
to the hedge recognized in earnings during the current or prior
year periods. Long-term debt has been increased by
$55 million and $78 million for the fair market value
of the interest rate swap agreements at December 26, 2003
and December 27, 2002, respectively.

The differential to be paid or received under
these agreements is accrued based on the terms of the agreements
and is recognized in interest expense over the term of the
related debt. The related amounts payable to, or receivable
from, counterparties are included in other current liabilities
or assets. Cash flows related to interest rate swap agreements
are classified as “Operating Activities” in the
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. For the years ended
December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, the Company
reduced interest expense by approximately $44 million and
$34 million, respectively, as a result of the interest rate
swap agreements that were in place during that year.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest
rate swap agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate
nonperformance by the counterparties.

Fuel
Hedging

In 2003, CSX began a program to hedge a portion
of its 2004 and 2005 locomotive fuel purchases. This program was
established to manage exposure to fuel price fluctuations. In
order


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to minimize this risk, CSX has entered into a
series of swaps in order to fix the price of a portion of its
estimated future fuel purchases.

Following is a summary of fuel swaps executed
during the year:



Estimated % of Future Fuel Consumption Hedged at
    December 26, 2003

18%

21%

The program limits fuel hedges to a 24-month
duration and a maximum of 80% of CSX’s average monthly fuel
purchased for any month within the 24-month period, and places
the hedges among selected counterparties. Fuel hedging activity
did not have an effect on fuel expense for the year ended
December 26, 2003. Ineffectiveness, or the extent to which
changes in the fair values of the fuel swaps did not offset
changes in the fair values of the expected fuel purchases, is
recorded in fuel expense and is immaterial.

These instruments qualify, and are designated by
management, as cash-flow hedges of variability in expected
future cash flows attributable to fluctuations in fuel prices.
The fair values of fuel derivative instruments are determined
based upon quoted marked prices and are recorded on the balance
sheet with offsetting adjustments to Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income, a component of Shareholders’ Equity.
As of December 26, 2003 this component was $6 million
after tax. The amounts recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income will be recorded in earnings in the period
in which the hedged fuel is consumed. Fair value adjustments are
noncash transactions, and accordingly, are excluded from the
Cash Flow Statement.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by other parties to fuel swap
agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate
nonperformance by the counterparties.

Per Share

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic earnings per share and earnings per share, assuming
dilution:

Earnings per share are based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Earnings per share,
assuming dilution, are based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of potential
common shares outstanding during the period, mainly arising from
the exercise of employee stock options. Potential common shares
at CSX include stock options and awards and shares that would be
issued relating to convertible long-term debt.


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Certain potential common shares (convertible debt
and stock options) for all three years shown were not included
in the computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution,
since their exercise or conversion prices were greater than the
average market price of the common shares during the period and,
therefore, their effect is antidilutive. These potential common
shares were as follows:

A substantial increase in the fair market value
of the Company’s stock price could negatively impact
earnings per share due to the dilutive effect of stock options
and convertible debt.

Note 15.     Stock
Plans

The Company maintains several stock option and
award plans designed to encourage ownership of its stock and
provide incentives for employees to contribute to its success.

Effective beginning with fiscal year 2003, CSX
voluntarily adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” and adopted the disclosure requirements of
SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure —
an amendment of SFAS 123.” Under SFAS 123, all
stock based awards will be expensed at fair value. In accordance
with the prospective method of adoption permitted under
SFAS 148, the Company has adopted the fair value
recognition provisions on a prospective basis. Previously, the
Company accounted for stock-based compensation under the
intrinsic-value method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
(APB) No. 25, “Accounting to Stock Issued to
Employees.” Under APB 25, CSX expensed amounts
associated with stock-based awards and disclosures were required
for any stock option awards.

Total compensation expense associated with stock
based compensation was $5 million, $6 million and
$9 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Stock Options and
Awards

CSX stock option and award plans provide
primarily (1) stock options and (2) restricted stock
awards (“RSAs”) to eligible officers and employees.
Awards granted under the various plans are determined by the
board of directors.

At December 26, 2003, there were 3,554
current or former employees with grants outstanding under the
various plans. A total of approximately 39 million shares
were reserved for issuance under the plans of which
9 million were available for new grants. The remaining
shares are assigned to outstanding stock options and stock
awards.

The fair value of options granted in 2003, 2002
and 2001 was estimated as of the dates of grant using the
Black-Scholes option model.

1.     Stock
Options

The majority of stock options have been granted
with 10-year terms. Options outstanding at December 26,
2003, are generally exercisable three to ten years after date of
grant. The exercise price for options granted equals the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. A summary of
the Company’s stock option activity and related information
for the fiscal years ended December 26, 2003,
December 27, 2002 and December 28, 2001 follows:

The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding at December 26, 2003:

During the years ended December 26, 2003 and
December 27, 2002, 0.3 million and 1.0 million
options, respectively, were exercised.

Stock Awards (“RSAs”)

At December 26, 2003 and December 27,
2002, 248,500 and 469,500 RSAs, respectively were outstanding.
The RSA’s outstanding at December 26, 2003, vest over
a three- to five-year employment period. The weighted-average
fair value of RSAs was $30.97 as of the date of grant.
Approximately $2 million, $6 million and
$9 million was expensed in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, in connection with restricted stock awards.

Stock Purchase and Loan
Plan

The Stock Purchase and Loan Plan
(“SPLP”) provided for the purchase of common stock and
related rights by eligible officers and key employees of the
Company and entitled them to obtain loans with respect to the
shares purchased. There were no shares issued, withdrawn,
exchanged or cancelled under the SPLP in 2003, 2002 or 2001. The
Plan expired in 2003. There were approximately 70,000 shares
outstanding in 2002 and 2001, respectively, under this program.

Stock Purchase and Dividend
Reinvestment Plans

1.     Stock
Purchase Plan

The 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“ESPP”) allows eligible employees to purchase CSX
common stock at a discount. Specifically, participating
employees were able to purchase CSX stock at the lower of 85% of
fair market value on December 1 (beginning of the annual
offering period) or 85% of fair market value on November 30
of the following year (end of the annual offering period). In
effect, employees received a 12-month stock option to purchase
Company stock. Once purchased, the shares were unrestricted and
could generally be sold or transferred at any time.
Approximately 540,000 shares and 570,000 shares were purchased
by employees under this plan during 2003 and 2002, respectively.
This plan was not extended for 2004.

The predecessor to the 2001 ESPP was the 1991
Employee Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
Employees purchased 25,565 shares under the plan in 2001 at a
weighted-average market price of $30.43.

2.     Dividend
Reinvestment Plan

The Company maintains the Shareholder Dividend
Reinvestment Plan under which shareholders may purchase
additional shares of stock. At December 26, 2003, there
were 4,626,035 shares available for issuance under this plan.

Stock Plan for
Directors

The Stock Plan for Directors, approved by the
shareholders in 1992, governs in part the manner in which
directors’ fees and retainers are paid. A minimum of 40% of
the retainers must be paid in common stock of the Company. In
2004, the minimum retainer to be paid in stock increases to 50%.
In addition, each director may elect to receive up to 100% of
the remaining retainer and fees in the form of common stock of
the Company. In 1997, shareholders approved amendments to the
Plan that would permit additional awards of stock or stock
options. In 2003, 36,219 shares of stock were issued to the
directors, resulting in $1 million of expense. In 2002,
45,195 shares of stock were issued to the directors, resulting
in $1 million of expense. In 2001, 52,000 stock options
were granted with an exercise price of $35.08. The Plan permits
each director to elect to transfer stock into a trust that will
hold the shares until the participant’s death,

disability, retirement as a director, other
cessation of services as a director, or change in control of the
Company. At December 26, 2003, there were 0.6 million
shares of common stock reserved for issuance under this Plan.

Note 16.     Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

Fair values of the Company’s financial
instruments are estimated by reference to quoted prices from
market sources and financial institutions, as well as other
valuation techniques. Long-term debt is the only financial
instrument of the Company with fair values significantly
different from their carrying amounts. At December 26,
2003, the fair value of long-term debt, including current
maturities, was $7.8 billion, compared with a carrying
amount of $7.3 billion. At December 27, 2002, the fair
value of long-term debt, including current maturities, was
$7.4 billion, compared with a carrying amount of
$6.9 billion. The fair value of long-term debt has been
estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based upon the
Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of financing arrangements. The Company’s interest
rate swap agreements at December 26, 2003 and
December 27, 2002 had a positive value of $55 and
$78 million, respectively. The Company’s fuel hedging
agreements at December 26, 2003 had a positive value of
$9 million. CSX had no fuel hedge agreements at
December 27, 2002.

Note 17.     Employee
Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension
plans, principally for salaried personnel. The plans provide
eligible employees with retirement benefits based principally on
years of service and compensation rates near retirement.

In addition to the defined benefit pension plans,
the Company sponsors three plans that provide medical and life
insurance benefits to most full-time salaried employees upon
their retirement. The postretirement medical plans are
contributory (partially funded by retiree), with retiree
contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is
non-contributory.

The benefit obligation for these plans represents
the liability of the Company for current and retired employees
and is affected primarily by the following:

Plan assets are amounts that have been segregated
and restricted to provide benefits, and include amounts
contributed by the Company and amounts earned from investing
contributions, less benefits paid. The Company uses a plan year
of October 1 through September 30 to value its pension and
postretirement plans on an actuarial basis. The Company funds
the cost of the postretirement medical and life insurance
benefits on a pay-as-you go basis. The pension plans are funded
at not less than the minimum funding standards set forth in the
Employee Retirement

Income Security Act of 1974. The distribution of
pension plan assets as of the September 30, 2003
measurement date is as follows:

CSX has established a target allocation of 60%
equity and 40% fixed income investments. Further diversification
and risk control is achieved by policy allocations to various
equity styles and investment managers. Allocations are
maintained at within 3% of targets. No leverage or investment in
CSX securities is allowed. The goal is to maintain assets at or
above benefit obligations (long-term liabilities) without
corporate contributions.

CSX expects to make cash contributions of
$14 million to its pension plan in 2004.

Benefit obligation and plan asset information is

Postretirement benefits reflects the impact of
    changing the plan benefit for individuals retiring after
    February 2003 which caps the employer cost at $8,000 (plus
    $7,000 for spouses).

The funded status, or amount by which the benefit
obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, represents a
liability. At December 26, 2003, the status of CSX plans is
as follows:

The following table shows the reconciliation of
the funded status of the plan with the amount recorded in the
statement of financial position:

A liability is recognized if net periodic pension
cost (cost of a pension plan for a period, including service
cost, interest cost, actual return on plan assets, gain or loss,
amortization of unrecognized prior service cost) recognized
exceeds amounts the employer has contributed to the plan. An
asset is recognized if net periodic pension cost is less than
amounts the employer has contributed to the plan.


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The amount recognized in the statement of
financial position consists of:

Components of net periodic pension cost are as
follows:

The $13 million termination charge in 2003
represents a curtailments charge associated with the retirement
of the Company’s former Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. The $10 million charge was the result of a
workforce reduction program that occurred in 2001.

During 2003 and 2002, CSX recorded changes in its
minimum pension liability. These changes did not affect net
earnings, but are a component of accumulated other comprehensive
loss on an after-tax basis. In 2003, the minimum pension
liability increased by $6 million, reducing accumulated
other comprehensive income by $3 million after tax. In
2002, the minimum pension liability increased by
$398 million, reducing accumulated other comprehensive
income by $248 million after tax. The Company also recorded
$10 million and $25 million after tax effect of
accumulated other comprehensive income, relating to
Conrail’s minimum pension liability for December 26,
2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively.


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Weighted-average assumptions used in accounting
for the plans are as follows:

The net postretirement benefit obligation was
determined using the assumption that the health care cost trend
rate for medical plans was 11% for 2003 and 2002, decreasing
gradually to 4.5% by 2012 and remaining at that level
thereafter. A 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend
rate would have the following effects:

In December 2003, the President of the United
States signed into law the “Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (“the
Act”), which introduces a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare Part D as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of
retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS 106
requires that changes in the law that take effect in the future
and affect future benefit coverage shall be considered in
current-period benefit measurements. However, as significant
uncertainties exist for how to account for the subsidy a plan
sponsor may not have sufficient information available to measure
effects of the Act, prepare related actuarial valuations, and
ensure proper accounting. Therefore, FASB has issued staff
position No. FAS 106-1 which allows a plan sponsor to elect
to defer recognizing the effects of the Act until authoritative
guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued, or
until certain other events occur. When the guidance is issued,
it may cause CSX to revise previously reported information. CSX
is currently evaluating how this legislation may impact its
postretirement benefit plans.

Other Plans

The Company maintains savings plans for virtually
all full-time salaried employees and certain employees covered
by collective bargaining agreements. Expense associated with
these plans was $15 million, $15 million and $16
million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Under collective bargaining agreements, the
Company participates in a number of union-sponsored,
multi-employer benefit plans. Payments to these plans are made
as part of aggregate assessments generally based on number of
employees covered, hours worked, tonnage moved or a combination
thereof. Total contributions of $360 million,
$315 million and $292 million were made to these plans
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

18.     Commitments and
Contingencies

Lease
Commitments

The Company has various lease agreements with
other parties with terms up to 42 years. Non-cancelable,
long-term leases generally include provisions for maintenance,
options to purchase and options to extend the terms.

At December 26, 2003, minimum building and
equipment rentals under these operating leases are as follows:

Rent expense on operating leases totaled
$564 million in 2003, $605 million in 2002 and
$629 million in 2001. These amounts include net daily
rental charges on railroad operating equipment aggregating
$297 million, $295 million, and $289 million in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively which are not long-term commitments.
In addition to these commitments, the Company also has
agreements covering routes and equipment leased from Conrail.
See Note 2, Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations
with Conrail, for a description of these commitments.

Purchase
Commitments

The Company has a commitment under a long-term
maintenance program for approximately 40% of CSXT’s fleet
of locomotives. The agreement expires in 2026 and totals
$2.6 billion. Minimum payments under this agreement are as
follows:

The long-term maintenance program assures CSX
access to efficient, high-quality locomotive maintenance
services at settled price levels through the term of the
program. Under the program, CSX paid $130 million,
$124 million and $126 million in fiscal years 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Guarantees

The Company and its subsidiaries are contingently
liable individually and jointly with others as guarantors of
obligations principally relating to leased equipment, joint
ventures and joint facilities used by CSX in its business
operations. Utilizing a CSX guarantee for these obligations
allows CSX to take advantage of lower interest rates and obtain
other favorable terms when negotiating leases or financing debt.
Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company that
could require CSX or one of its affiliates to make payment to or
to perform certain actions for the guaranteed party based on
another entity’s failure to perform. Upon the adoption of
FIN 45 in 2003, the Company’s evaluation of its guarantees
did not result in any amounts for guarantees being recorded on
the balance sheet. CSX’s guarantees can be segregated into
three main categories:

1. Guarantees of approximately
    $440 million of lease commitments assumed by
    A.P. Moller-Maersk (“Maersk”) for which the
    Company is contingently liable. CSX believes that Maersk will
    fulfill its contractual commitments with respect to such leases
    and that CSX will have no further liabilities for those
    obligations.

2. Guarantees of approximately
    $97 million relating to construction and cash deficiency
    support guarantees at several of the Company’s
    international terminal locations under development. The
    non-performance of one of its partners, cost overruns or
    non-compliance with financing loan covenants could cause the
    Company to have to perform under these guarantees.

3. CSX guarantees of approximately
    $300 million relating to leases assumed as part of
    CSX’s conveyance of its interest in CSX Lines in February
    2003, as discussed in Note 3, Divestitures.

The maximum amount of future payments the Company
could be required to make under these guarantees is the amount
of the guarantees themselves.

Self-Insurance

The Company obtains substantial amounts of
commercial insurance for potential losses for third-party
liability and property damages. Specified levels of risk (up to
$35 million for property and $25 million for liability
per occurrence) are retained on a self-insurance basis. The
Company uses a combination of third-party and self-insurance to
realize savings on insurance premium costs.

Matters
Arising Out of Sale of International Container-Shipping
Assets

In 2003, CSX finalized a settlement agreement
with Maersk resolving all remaining material disputes pending
directly between the two companies, consisting predominantly of
two major disputes. The first dispute involved a post-closing
working capital adjustment to the sale price for which the
Company had recorded a receivable of approximately
$70 million. The second dispute involved a claim of
425 million Dutch Guilders (approximately $180 million
at then prevailing currency exchange rates) plus interest by
Europe Container Terminals BV (“ECT”) alleging
breaches of contract by the Company at the Rotterdam container
terminal facility owned by ECT.

Also in 2003, CSX entered into a final settlement
agreement with Maersk allocating responsibility between the two
companies for third party claims and litigation relating to the
assets acquired by Maersk.


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The two settlements reduced the Company’s
2003 earnings by $108 million pretax, $67 million
after tax. This charge is reflected in the financial statements
as an additional loss on the sale of the international
container-shipping assets. Neither settlement has a material
impact on cash flows.

STB
Proceeding

In 2001 Duke Energy Corporation
(“Duke”) filed a complaint before the U.S. Surface
Transportation Board (“STB”) alleging that certain
CSXT common carrier coal rates are unreasonably high. In
February 2004, the STB issued a decision finding that the CSXT
common carrier rates were reasonable. While approving the rate
levels, the STB also invited Duke to request a phase-in of rate
increases over some time period. The nature and amount of any
such phase-in is uncertain, and would only apply to billings
subsequent to December 2001. CSXT will continue to consider and
pursue all available legal defenses in this matter.
Administrative and legal appeals are possible, and could take
several years to resolve. An unfavorable outcome to this
complaint would not have a material effect on the Company.

Contract
Settlement

In 2002, the Company received $44 million as
the first of two payments to settle a contract dispute. During
2002, the Company recognized approximately $7 million of the
first payment in other income as this amount related to prior
periods. The remaining $37 million will be recognized over
the contract period, which ends in 2020. The second payment of
$23 million was received in 2003 and will be recognized
over the contract period which ends in 2020. The results of this
settlement will provide approximately $3 million in annual
pretax earnings through 2020.

Other Legal
Proceedings

CSX is involved in routine litigation incidental
to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and
claims, various governmental proceedings and private civil
lawsuits, including those related to environmental matters.
Federal Employers’ Liability Act claims by employees, other
personal injury claims, and disputes and complaints involving
certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal
proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory
damages, and others purport to be class actions. While the final
outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty,
considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses
available and liabilities that have been recorded along with
applicable insurance, it is the opinion of CSX management that
none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations, financial position or liquidity of CSX.
However, an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of
these items could have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year. The
company is also party to a number of actions, the resolution of
which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be
material to results of operations in the quarters received.

Note 19.     Business
Segments

The Company operates in three business segments:
rail, intermodal, and international terminals. The rail segment
provides rail freight transportation over a network of more than
23,000 route miles in 23 states, the District of Columbia and
two Canadian provinces. The intermodal segment provides
transcontinental intermodal transportation services and operates
a network of dedicated intermodal facilities across North
America. The international terminals segment operates container
freight terminal facilities and related businesses in Asia,
Europe,


CSX CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Australia, Latin America and the United States.
The Company’s segments are strategic business units that
offer different services and are managed separately based on the
differences in these services. Because of their close
interrelationship, the rail and intermodal segments are viewed
on a combined basis as Surface Transportation operations.

The Company evaluates performance and allocates
resources based on several factors, of which the primary
financial measure is business segment operating income, defined
as income from operations excluding the effects of non-recurring
charges and gains. The accounting policies of the segments are
the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies (Note 1), except that for segment
reporting purposes, CSX includes minority interest expense on
the international terminals segment’s joint venture
businesses in operating expense. These amounts are reclassified
through eliminations in CSX’s consolidated financial
statements to other income. Intersegment sales and transfers are
generally accounted for as if the sales or transfers were to
third parties, at current market prices.

Business segment information for the years ended
December 26, 2003, December 27, 2002 and
December 28, 2001 is as follows:

    additions are primarily attributable to non-transportation
    businesses and discontinued operations. Principal
    non-transportation businesses include real estate and resort
    operations.

Revenues in the United States comprise more than
95% of total consolidated revenues. Approximately 95% of the
Company’s long-lived assets are located in the United
States. The Company does not have a single external customer
that represents 10% or more of its consolidated revenue.

Financial Data — CSX Vessel Leasing (formerly
Sea-Land)

During 1987, Sea-Land entered into agreements to
sell and lease back, by charter, three new U.S.-built ,
U.S.-flag, D-7 class container ships. The ships were not
included in the sale of international liner assets to Maersk in
December 1999 and the related debt remains an obligation of CSX
Lines. CSX has guaranteed the obligations of CSX Lines pursuant
to the related charters which, along with the container ships,
serve as collateral for debt securities registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As noted in Note 3 of
the Annual Report, Divestitures, CSX agreed to convey certain
assets of CSX Lines to Horizon Lines LLC. These obligations are
