1.  Business by Segment

CSX
Corporation (“CSX” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), based in
Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation
companies.  Surface Transportation, which includes the Company’s rail
and intermodal businesses, provides rail-based transportation services including
traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and
trailers.

Rail

CSX’s
principal operating company, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides a
crucial link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 21,000
route mile rail network, which serves every major population center in 23 states
east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian
provinces of Ontario and Quebec.  It serves 70 ocean, river and lake
ports along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes
and the St. Lawrence Seaway.  CSXT also serves thousands of production
and distribution facilities through track connections to more than 230
short-line and regional railroads.

Other
Entities

In
addition to CSXT, the rail segment includes Total Distribution Services, Inc.
(“TDSI”), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (“Transflo”), CSX Technology, Inc.
(“CSX Technology”) and other subsidiaries.  TDSI serves the automotive
industry with distribution centers and storage locations, while Transflo
provides logistical solutions for transferring products from rail to
trucks.  Technology and other support services are provided by CSX
Technology and other subsidiaries.

Intermodal

CSX
Intermodal, Inc. (“Intermodal”), one of the nation’s largest coast-to-coast
intermodal transportation providers,

is a stand-alone,
integrated intermodal company linking customers to railroads via trucks and
terminals.  Containers and trailers are loaded and unloaded from
trains, and trucks provide the link between intermodal terminals and the
customer.

Surface
Transportation Businesses

The rail
and intermodal segments are designated by the Company on a combined basis as
Surface Transportation businesses.  Together, they generated $10
billion of revenue during 2007 and served four primary lines of
business:

·

The
      merchandise business is the most diverse market with nearly 2.7 million
      carloads per year of aggregates, which includes crushed stone, sand and
      gravel, metal, phosphate, fertilizer, food, consumer, agricultural, paper
      and chemical products.  The merchandise business generated
      approximately 50% of the Company’s revenue in 2007 and 38% of
      volume.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
I

·

Coal,
      which delivered approximately 1.9 million carloads of coal, coke and iron
      ore to electricity generating power plants, ocean, river and lake piers
      and terminals, steel makers and industrial plants, accounted for
      approximately 26% of the Company’s revenue and volume in 2007.  The
      Company transports almost one-third of every ton of coal used for
      generating electricity in the areas served by
  CSX.

·

Automotive,
      which delivers both finished vehicles and auto parts, generated 8% of the
      Company’s revenue and 6% of the Company’s volume in 2007.  The
      Company delivers approximately one-third of North America’s light
      vehicles, serving both traditional manufacturers and the increasing number
      of global manufacturers.

·

Intermodal
      offers a competitive cost advantage over long-haul trucking by combining
      the superior economics of rail transportation with the short-haul
      flexibility of trucks.  Through its network of more than 50
      terminals, Intermodal serves all major markets east of the Mississippi
      River and transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers,
      providing customers with truck-like service for longer
      shipments.  For 2007, Intermodal accounted for approximately 14%
      of the Company’s total revenue and 30% of
  volume.

Other revenue, which includes revenue
from regional railroads (that are partially owned by CSX), demurrage, switching
and other incidental charges, accounted for 2% of the Company’s total 2007
revenue.  Revenue from regional railroads includes shipments by
railroads that CSX does not directly operate.  Demurrage represents
charges assessed by railroads when shippers or receivers of freight hold
railcars beyond a specified period of time.  Switching revenue is
generated when CSXT switches cars between trains for a customer or another
railroad.

Other
Businesses

CSX’s
other holdings include CSX Real Property, Inc., a subsidiary responsible for the
Company’s real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development
activities, and CSX Hotels, Inc., a resort doing business as The Greenbrier,
located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.  Pretax earnings of
$42 million, $24 million and $85 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
from these activities are classified as a component of other
income.  These items are classified in other income because they are
not considered by the Company to be operating activities and may fluctuate with
the timing of real estate sales and resort seasonality.

The
Company also has certain residual activities from formerly owned companies that
include leasing of equipment and vessels.  These results are included
in consolidated operating income and totaled $5 million, $12 million and $1
million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Company
History

A leader
in freight rail transportation for 180 years, the Company’s roots date back to
the early nineteenth century when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (“B&O”) –
the nation’s first common carrier – was chartered in 1827. Since that time, CSX
has built on the foundation laid by early pioneers who had a vision to create a
railroad that safely and reliably services the ever-increasing demands of a
growing nation.

In those 180 years, numerous railroads
have combined with the former B&O through merger and consolidation to create
what has become CSX.  Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX
family brought to CSX unique and valuable geographical reach to new markets,
gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors.

CSX was
incorporated in 1978, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. In 1980,
the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System (“Chessie”) and Seaboard
Coast Line Industries (“Seaboard”) into CSX.  The merger allowed CSX
to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing
southeastern markets. In 1986, the Chessie and Seaboard operating entities were
transferred to the rail entity CSXT, which was created through the
merger.  Intermodal was originally formed in 1986 in order to provide
nationwide, door-to-door intermodal service.

In 1997,
CSXT and Norfolk Southern jointly acquired the rights to operate Conrail, Inc.
(“Conrail”) and then in 2004, CSXT acquired an allocated portion of Conrail’s
assets, which CSXT operated.  Conrail was formed in 1976 from several
financially troubled northeast railroads to restructure and revive the region’s
railroads.  CSX’s acquisition of key portions of Conrail allowed CSXT
to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area,
with Chicago, Midwest markets and the growing areas in the southeast that were
already served by CSXT.  This current rail network allows the Company
to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with
dependable, environmentally friendly and fuel efficient freight transportation
and intermodal service.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
I

Regulatory
Environment

The
Company's operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws
and regulations, generally applicable to many businesses in the United
States.  The railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries,
including CSXT, are subject in many respects to the regulatory jurisdiction of
the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) and the Federal Railroad Administration
(“FRA”), which are both part of the Department of Transportation
(“DOT”).  Additionally, the Transportation Security Administration
(“TSA”), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), has the
authority to issue regulations and other directives that may also affect
railroad operations. In some cases, state and local laws and regulations can be
preempted in their application to railroads by the operation of these and other
federal authorities.

Although
the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated rail rates and much of the
rail traffic of the Company's subsidiaries is currently exempt from rate
regulation by agency decision, the STB has broad jurisdiction over railroad
commercial practices.  This includes jurisdiction over freight car
rent, the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, rates charged on
certain regulated rail traffic and any acquisition of control over rail common
carriers.  In 2007, for example, the STB issued decisions changing its
long-standing policy on fuel surcharges, its rules for large freight rate cases
and a new process for rate cases where smaller amounts are at
issue.

The FRA
and its sister agency within the DOT, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Administration, have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and
practices, including track, freight cars and locomotives, and hazardous
materials requirements.  The TSA has broad authority over railroad
operating practices that may have homeland security implications.  The
TSA has proposed regulations that would apply to the transportation of certain
kinds of highly hazardous materials.  Decisions of these and other
agencies can affect the profitability of the Company’s business.  For
further discussion on regulatory risks to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors
beginning on page 8.

Competition

The business environment in which the
Company operates is highly competitive.  Shippers typically select
transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service
and price.  Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and
reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary
competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available
transportation.

CSX’s primary rail competitor is the
Norfolk Southern, which operates throughout much of CSX’s territory.  
Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.  Depending on
the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may
exert pressure on price and service levels.  For further discussion on
the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on
page 8.

Item

1A.  Risk Factors

The
following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could cause those
results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company’s
forward-looking statements.  Although the risks described below are
those that management believes are the most significant, these are not the only
risks facing the Company.  Additional risks and uncertainties not
currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be
material also may materially impact the Company’s financial position, results of
operations and liquidity.

New
legislation or regulatory changes could impact the Company’s earnings or
regulate its ability to independently negotiate prices.

The
Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including
the STB, the FRA and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety
of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other
matters.  Legislation passed by Congress or regulations issued by
these agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of
the Company’s business.  For example, regulations imposing price
constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the
Company’s profitability.  Also, additional regulations related to
environmental matters such as greenhouse gas emissions or legislative changes
impacting hours of service requirements could adversely affect the Company’s
financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

CSXT,
as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous
materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and
claims.

Under federal regulations, CSXT is
required to transport hazardous materials under its common carrier
obligation.  A train accident involving the transport of hazardous
materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury,
property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation.  CSXT is
also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous
materials.  Failure to comply with these regulations can subject the
Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out
of a train accident.  Finally, legislation preventing the transport of
hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion
and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances.

The
Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in
significant costs.

The Company’s operations are subject to
wide-ranging federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations
concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, discharges into water,
the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials
and clean-up of hazardous material or petroleum releases.  In certain
circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated
properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third
parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned and
used by the Company.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
I

The
Company has been, and may be subject to, allegations or findings to the effect
that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or
regulations, and such violations can result in the Company’s incurring fines,
penalties or costs relating to the clean-up of environmental contamination.

Although the Company
believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for
known future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs as a result
of any of the foregoing and may be required to incur significant expenses to
investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental
contamination.

General
economic, geo-political and compliance risks may affect the Company’s operations
and financial results.

Changes
in general economic conditions that affect demand for rail or intermodal
services could adversely affect the Company’s financial position, results of
operations and liquidity.  In addition, abrupt political change or
terrorist activity poses a risk of general economic disruption and could require
changes in the operations and security arrangements, thus increasing the
operating costs.  These conditions may lend additional uncertainty to
the timing and purchasing decisions by the Company’s customers.

Fuel
prices and supply are influenced by international political and economic
circumstances.  Although a fuel recovery program is in place with a
considerable number of customers, the Company could be negatively impacted if it
were unable to realize fuel surcharges.  Additionally, if a fuel
supply shortage were to arise, whether due to the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) or other production restrictions, lower refinery
outputs, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, the Company would be
negatively impacted.

The FRA
regulates several of the Company’s core operations including track and
mechanical equipment standards, signaling systems, inspection of grade crossing
warning devices, locomotive engineer certifications and employee injury
reporting, among other areas.  The Company’s unintentional failure to
comply with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in
CSX.  In addition, a change in these regulations could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and
liquidity.

Network
congestion, caused by unanticipated increases in freight or passenger activity,
could have a negative impact on service and operating efficiency.

The
Company may experience rail network difficulties related to network capacity,
unplanned increases in demand for rail service, increased passenger activities
in capacity-constrained areas or regulatory changes impacting when CSXT can
transport freight or its service routes that could have a negative effect on the
Company’s operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset
utilization and overall efficiency.  In addition, the Company may face
external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including
floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, which may disrupt the Company’s
operations.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
I

Increases
in the number and magnitude of property damage and personal injury claims could
adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company faces inherent business
risk from exposure to property damage, occupational injury claims, and personal
injury claims resulting from train accidents, worker injury claims under FELA
and claims from outside parties resulting from the Company’s operations. 
Although the Company is working diligently to enhance its safety programs and to
continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety, the
Company could experience material property damage, personal injury or
occupational claims in the future and it may incur significant costs to defend
such claims.

Existing claims may suffer adverse
developments not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate
outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the
Company’s control. The Company establishes reserves to cover all of these types
of claims.  However, final amounts determined to be due on any
outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded
reserves.

The
Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in
significant expenditures.

The Company is subject to various
existing lawsuits and potential unknown litigation.  The Company may
experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend any such
lawsuits.  Additionally, existing litigation may suffer adverse
development not currently reflected in the Company’s reserve estimates as the
ultimate outcome of existing litigation is subject to numerous factors outside
of the Company’s control.  While the Company uses its best efforts to
evaluate existing litigation, the final judgments may differ materially from the
recorded reserves.

Future
acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may
cause significant disruptions in the Company’s operations.

Terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred in the United States in September
2001, in Spain in March 2004, in England in July 2005, and in India in July
2006, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect
the Company’s financial position, results of operations and
liquidity.  CSXT’s rail lines or other key infrastructure may be
direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war.  This
could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and
liabilities and decreased revenues.  In addition, insurance premiums
charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the Company
could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be
available.

Furthermore,
in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local
governmental bodies are proposing and beginning to adopt various legislation and
regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation
industry.  For example, the DHS proposed regulations that would
require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when
transporting hazardous materials.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
I

Failure
to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in
strikes and/or work stoppages.

Most of CSXT's employees are
represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Generally speaking, these agreements are bargained nationally by the National
Carriers Committee.  In the rail industry, negotiations have generally
taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any
extended work stoppages.  Over the last 30 years, there were only six
days of work stoppage related to labor disputes over national
handling.  If the Company is unable to negotiate acceptable
agreements, it could result in strikes by the affected workers, loss of business
and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to
union members, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations and liquidity.  Under the
Railway Labor Act’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and
the possibility of Presidential intervention), neither party may exercise
self-help until the procedures are exhausted.

The
Company relies on the stability and availability of its technology systems to
operate its business.

The
Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its
business.  A significant disruption or failure of our information
technology systems, including computer hardware, software and communications
equipment, could result in a service interruption, safety failure, security
breach or other operational difficulties.  While the Company has taken
steps to mitigate these risks, the performance and reliability of its technology
systems are critical to its ability to compete effectively.

The
Company faces competition from rail carriers and other transportation
providers.

The
Company experiences competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and
other factors from other transportation providers including railroads and motor
carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less
significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Transportation providers such
as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights-of-way that are built and
maintained by governmental entities while CSXT and other railroads must build
and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources. Any future
improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the
cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation providing for less
stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the
Company’s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

Segment

Rail
Property

CSXT’s properties primarily consist of
track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight
cars.  These categories and the geography of the network are described
below.

Track
and Infrastructure

Serving
23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and
Quebec, the CSXT rail network serves, among other markets, New York,
Philadelphia and Boston in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, the southeast markets
of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans, and the Midwestern cities of St. Louis,
Memphis and Chicago.

CSXT’s
track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards
(known as mainline track); track within terminals and switching yards; track
adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains; track connecting the mainline
track to customer locations

;

and track that
diverts trains from one track to another known as turnouts.  Total
track miles are greater than the Company’s approximately 21,000 route miles,
which reflect the size of CSX’s rail network that connects markets, customers
and western railroads.  At December 2007, the breakdown of track miles
was as follows:

Track

Miles

Mainline
      track

26,712

Terminals
      and switching yards

9,626

Passing
      sidings and turnouts

1,037

Total

37,375

In
addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates numerous yards and
terminals.  These serve as the hubs between CSXT and its local customers
and as sorting facilities where rail cars often are received, re-sorted and
placed onto new outbound trains.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
I

The
following 36 yards are identified as key to the CSXT system (listed in
alphabetical order by state):

For a
list of Intermodal’s terminals, see page 16.

Network
Geography

CSXT’s
train operations are primarily focused around the following four major
transportation networks, which are defined geographically or by line of business
and are described below.

Coal Network

–

Coal
is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the United
States.  The CSXT coal network connects mining operations in nine
states with industrial areas in the northeast and mid-Atlantic, as well as many
river, lake and seaport facilities.  This network also supports the
strong, growing utility market in the southeast.

Southeastern
Corridor

– This section of
the network runs from the western gateways of Chicago, Memphis and St. Louis
through the growing cities of Nashville, Birmingham and Atlanta and into the
expanding markets in the southeast.  CSXT’s capacity investment in this
corridor clearly strengthens this route and makes it the premier rail route
connecting these key cities and gateways with the growing southeast.  The
corridor extends through the coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and
provides direct rail service between these coal sources and the increasing
demand for coal in the southeast.  The increase in capacity on this
corridor

positions CSXT well to handle the
projected traffic volumes of intermodal, coal, automotive and general
merchandise traffic.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
I

Interstate 90 (I-90)
Corridor

– Chicago and metropolitan areas in New York and New England are
linked by CSXT’s I-90 Corridor.  Much of this route has two lanes of
track side-by-side (referred to as double mainline track) supporting high-speed
intermodal and automotive services.  The I-90 Corridor is also a
primary route for import traffic moving across the country, through Chicago and
into the population centers in the northeast.  Continued growth in
consumption in the east and northeast makes this corridor a critical element in
the Company’s overall system.

Interstate 95 (I-95)
Corridor

– Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities
throughout the growing southeast are connected to the heavily populated
northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York along CSXT’s I-95
Corridor.  This route is primarily used to ship food and consumer
products, as well as metals and chemicals.  It is the only rail
corridor along the east coast south of Washington, D.C., and provides access to
all the major eastern ports.

Locomotives

CSXT focuses on maximum use of its
fleet and prudent investment in new units to drive the rail
network.  Better locomotive management helps CSXT move freight more
efficiently, while continued investment in CSXT’s power source means CSXT is
operating more locomotives better.

CSXT
operates more than 4,000 locomotives, of which over 95% are owned by
CSXT.  Freight locomotives are the power source used primarily to pull
rail cars.  Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort railcars
so that the right railcar gets attached to the right train in order to get it to
its final destination.  Auxiliary units are typically used to provide
extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain.  At December 2007,
CSXT’s owned and long-term leased locomotives consisted of the
following:

Car Fleet

The
average daily fleet of cars-on-line consists of approximately 222,000 cars, but
at any point in time, over half of the railcars on the CSXT system are not owned
or leased by CSXT.   Examples of these are: railcars owned by other
railroads (which are utilized by CSXT), shipper-furnished or private cars (which
are generally used only in that shipper’s service) and multi-level
railcars.

CSXT’s
freight car fleet consists of six main types of cars:

Gondolas

– Support
CSXT’s metals markets and provide transport for woodchips and other bulk
commodities.  Some gondolas are equipped with special hoods for
protecting products like coil and sheet steel.

Open-top hoppers

–
Transport heavy dry bulk commodities such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and
gravel that are resistant to weather conditions.

Box cars

– Include a
variety of tonnages, sizes, door configurations and heights to accommodate a
wide range of finished products, including paper, auto parts, appliances and
building materials.  Insulated box cars deliver food products, canned
goods, beer and wine.

Covered hoppers

–
Have a permanent roof and are segregated based upon commodity
density.  Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour,
salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered
hoppers.  Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and glass
sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers.

Multi-level flat cars

– Transport finished automobiles and are differentiated by the number of levels:
bi-levels for large vehicles such as pickup trucks and SUVs and tri-levels for
sedans and smaller automobiles.

Flat cars

– Used for
shipping intermodal containers and trailers or bulk and finished goods, such as
lumber, pipe, plywood, drywall and pulpwood.

Other
cars owned or leased on the network include, but are not limited to, center beam
cars for transporting lumber and building products.

CSXT

Management's

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

STRATEGIC
OVERVIEW

The
Company provides customers access to a modern transportation network that
connects ports, production and distribution centers to markets in the Northeast,
Midwest and the rapidly growing southern states.  The Company
transports a diversified portfolio of products, from domestically abundant coal
to new energy sources such as ethanol, from automobiles produced by traditional
American manufacturers to “new domestic” factories owned by European, Japanese
and Korean companies, and from life-essential chemicals to life-enriching
consumer electronics. Additionally, the Company serves every major market in the
eastern United States and has direct access to all Atlantic and Gulf Coast
ports, as well as the Mississippi River, The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence
Seaway.  Furthermore, the Company has access to Pacific ports through
alliances with western railroads. Overall, the Company’s transportation network
encompasses approximately 21,000 route miles of track in 23 states, the District
of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.

As the
nation consumes increasingly higher quantities of imported goods, those products
must be transported across the country in a way that minimizes the impact on the
environment, takes traffic off an already congested highway system and minimizes
fuel consumption and transportation costs.  The Company’s
transportation network, located in the largest and fastest-growing population
centers in the nation, is well-positioned to capitalize on consumption growth
trends.  In this regard, more than two-thirds of Americans live within
the Company’s service territory, accounting for about three-quarters of the
nation’s consumption.

The
Company has made substantial strides in operating performance in order to
capitalize on these consumption growth trends.  In 2004, the Company
implemented the ONE Plan, which continues to focus on optimizing the train
network and utilizing rail assets more efficiently.  Anchored by the
ONE Plan and a variety of other initiatives implemented after the ONE Plan was
introduced, the Company has achieved significant operational improvements that
have enhanced safety, service reliability and productivity.  These
strong results include the highest customer satisfaction scores ever achieved by
the Company as measured by independent surveys of its customers.

In
addition to the ONE Plan, the Company recently embarked on a new initiative
called Total Service Integration (“TSI”), which aims to better align the
Company’s capabilities with customer demands. TSI aims to optimize
train size and increase asset utilization while delivering more reliable
service to customers.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

These
initiatives delivered strong results for shareholders while higher levels
of customer service have led to improved pricing.  These efforts
combined with operational efficiencies have resulted in substantial improvements
in CSX’s operating income and operating ratio.

In
addition to driving better financial results to create value for shareholders,
CSX also employs a balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of
shareholders.  This approach includes investments in the future, share
repurchases and dividends.  Through this balanced use of financial
resources, CSX will continue to capitalize on an economic environment that is
increasingly favoring rail transportation.


CSX Highlights

·

Revenue
      grew $464 million or 5% to over $10
billion.

·

Expenses
      increased $339 million or 5% to $7.8 billion, which included $141 million
      of higher prior year gains on insurance recoveries (which reduced
      operating expenses) and $98 million of higher fuel
  costs.

·

Surface
      Transportation Operating Income, which excludes other operating income,
      increased $125 million to $2.3
billion.

·

Service
      and safety measurements improved in all
  categories.

Leadership, discipline and execution
resulted in excellent 2007 results, which included the lowest Surface
Transportation operating ratio in a decade.  Revenue and revenue per
unit increased 5% and 8%, respectively, from a year ago reflecting the improving
value CSX provides its customers through better service.  The Company
was able to achieve substantial pricing gains predominantly due to CSXT service
improvements and the overall cost advantages that the Company’s rail-based
solutions provide to customers versus other modes of
transportation.

The strong results in revenue were
achieved despite volume declines in all of the Company’s four major lines of
business.  The overall 3% volume decrease versus last year was
primarily driven by continued weakness in the merchandise market relating to
housing construction and associated markets, as well as lower automotive
production.

Expenses
were higher due to the effects of rising fuel prices and higher prior year gains
on insurance recoveries, which were recorded as a reduction to operating
expenses.  Lower 2007 volume and better productivity from improved
operations partially offset the effects of inflation for certain expense
categories.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

For
additional information, refer to Rail and Intermodal Results of Operations
discussed on pages 40 through 43.

The
Company’s continued focus on safety and operating plan execution helped all
service measurements improve compared to last year.  Within the
service measures, CSX

achieved
record performance on both of its key safety measures (FRA Personal Injuries
Frequency Index and FRA Train Accident Rate) in 2007 despite some costly train
accidents. Improved safety is the result of the safety leadership and train
accident prevention processes. Both of these use training, awareness, compliance
measurement and root cause analysis to prevent incidents and create a safer work
environment.

In
addition, CSX continues to improve its train operations with gains of 4% and 12%
in On-Time Train Originations and On-Time Destination Arrivals,
respectively.  Velocity, a measure of overall network fluidity,
increased 5% in 2007.  More important was the consistent week-to-week
velocity, which indicates more reliable service to
customers.  Improved network operations also drove increased asset
utilization, including an improvement of 8% in Dwell, which is the average time
cars spend in terminals when being switched. The table below shows these key
measurements and resources.

Other
Highlights

While operating activities generated
higher cash, free cash flow, which includes dividend payments, declined $216
million to $145 million during 2007.  The decline was primarily due to
higher capital expenditures and dividends, along with lower insurance recoveries
from claims related to Hurricane Katrina.  See page 32 for further
details on the changes in free cash flow during 2007.

Surface Transportation capital
expenditures, which exclude The Greenbrier, were $1.7 billion in
2007.  This level of investment highlights the Company’s commitment to
maintain and improve its existing infrastructure and to position itself for
long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity.  The
increase compared to prior year was largely due to refinancing a portion of its
locomotive capacity by replacing 150 leased units with newly owned
locomotives.

CSX also announced three significant
financial events in 2007.  First, CSX increased its quarterly dividend
from $0.10 to $0.12 during the first quarter of 2007.  It then
increased the dividend again during the third quarter of 2007 to $0.15, which
represented a 50% increase from the quarterly dividend level at fourth quarter
2006.  Finally, CSX announced a total of $3 billion in share
repurchase programs during 2007 and has completed about 70% of the
repurchases.  See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant
Accounting Policies.

Expectations

Long-term
Transportation Demand

Transportation demand is based on increases in population and higher consumption
levels, which in turn drive the production of goods domestically and abroad that
must be transported from factories and ports to the markets where they will be
consumed.

Recent census projections estimate that today’s population of 301 million people
will grow to more than 330 million by 2020.  Major metropolitan areas in
the southeast, where CSX has a strong presence, are projected to grow at
significantly faster rates.  Even in slower-growing areas over the
remainder of the Company’s territory, consumption levels are projected to
increase.

Freight tonnage – domestic and international – is expected to increase nearly
50% by 2020, according to the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO), placing further strain on the transportation
system of America and requiring reliable solutions for shippers
worldwide.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Impact
on CSX

The Company is well positioned to meet the nation’s growing transportation
demand.  For example, due to factors such as highway congestion, new
regulations on hours of service and driver shortages in the trucking industry,
trucking companies are beginning to partner with the Company to outsource their
long-haul services and reduce their cost of shipping due to the superior cost
structure of the railroads for long-haul shipments.

Additionally, the need for environmentally sensitive transportation solutions
also favors CSX because railroads are three times more fuel efficient than
highway transportation.  A single train can carry the load of more than 280
trucks, reducing highway congestion and pollution while moving goods more
efficiently.

Industry analysts predict that the pricing environment will reflect the
increasing importance of railroads in serving America’s growing transportation
needs and the cost of the infrastructure investments needed to maintain the
safety and security of these networks and to expand them.  This will drive
revenue growth as volumes increase.  Furthermore, while the market for
transportation services remains competitive, tighter capacity and improved
service levels through initiatives such as the ONE Plan and TSI are expected to
sustain this favorable pricing environment, reflecting the overall value that
CSX provides to its customers.

Forecasts

The Company bases its performance expectations on external forecasts of economic
indicators such as gross domestic product, industrial production and overall
import levels.  Although certain markets will remain weak, such as
those that are impacted by the housing and automotive sectors, the indicators
that influence CSX’s businesses are expected to be favorable in 2008. 
Considering these and other factors, the Company believes that its business
environment remains strong and will support consistent, continuous financial
improvements for the next several years.

Considering the Company’s solid overall business environment, along with
momentum in its underlying business performance, CSX expects that its financial
performance in 2008 will be consistent with its long-term financial targets,
which include compounded annual growth rates (“CAGR”) as shown
below:

To reinforce its long-term vision, the
Company’s Surface Transportation capital budget is expected to be nearly $5
billion between 2008 and 2010.  These investments come at a time when the
return on investment in the railroad industry is improving.  Approximately
60% of the Company’s capital is targeted for infrastructure investment to
improve network reliability and recoverability and to drive even better
performance in safety.  Another 20% of the Company’s capital will be
invested in its locomotive and freight car fleets.  The remaining 20% of
CSX’s capital spending will further expand network terminal capacity, improve
technology and position the Company for long-term growth.

Free
Cash Flow

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP
financial measure under SEC Regulation G,

Disclosure of Non-GAAP
Measures.

Management believes, however, that free cash flow is important
in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures an ability to
generate cash without incurring additional external financing. Free cash flow
should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided
by operating activities.

Free cash flow is calculated by using
net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions, dividends and
certain other investing activities such as insurance proceeds.  Also,
added to free cash flow is the Company’s 42% economic interest in Conrail’s free
cash flow which is not consolidated in CSX amounts.  Other deposits,
which are included in cash provided by operating activities, are not included in
the Company’s free cash flow because these deposits represent assets that were
set aside for specific debt payments.

The following table reconciles cash
provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP
measure).

Financial

Results of Operations

vs. 2006 Consolidated Results of Operations

Prior
periods have been reclassified to conform to the current
presentation.

NM
- - not meaningful

(a)
Other operating income was $5 million and $12 million for 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Operating
Revenue

Operating revenue increased $464
million to over $10 billion in 2007 due to continued pricing efforts and service
improvements.  These gains were partially offset by lower volume due
to weakness in housing construction, domestic automobile production and related
markets.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Operating
Income

Operating income increased $118 million
to $2.3 billion in 2007.  Improvements in revenue and productivity
from improved operations were partially offset by lower gains on insurance
recoveries and increased fuel costs.

Other
Income

Other income of $93 million in 2007 was
relatively flat compared to the prior year.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $25 million
to $417 million in 2007 primarily due to higher average debt
balances.

Income
Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased $175
million to $706 million.  This change is primarily due to higher
earnings in 2007 and a prior year income tax benefit of $151 million related to
the resolution of certain tax matters that were not repeated.

Net
Earnings

Consolidated net earnings increased $26
million and totaled $1.3 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.17
to $2.99.  The principal elements of these increases are:

·

Operating
      income increased $118 million driven by strong Surface Transportation
      results.  These strong results were more than offset by $151
      million of prior year income tax benefits that were not
      repeated.  The net of these and other items decreased earnings
      from continuing operations by $84 million or $.08 per diluted
      share.

·

The
      $110 million or $.25 per diluted share gain in discontinued operations on
      the Company’s consolidated income statement in 2007 related to the
      resolution of certain tax matters associated with previously discontinued
      operations.



CSX

vs. 2005 Consolidated Results of Operations

Prior
periods have been reclassified to conform to the current
presentation.

(a)

Other
      operating income was $12 million and $1 million in 2006 and 2005,
      respectively.

Operating
Revenue

Operating revenue increased $948
million in 2006 to $9.6 billion, compared to $8.6 billion for the prior
year.  The primary components of the revenue gain were continued yield
management and the Company’s fuel surcharge program, which drove revenue per
unit across all major markets.

Operating
Income

Operating income increased $588 million
to $2.1 billion in 2006, which was driven by increased operating
revenues.  These revenue gains and gains on insurance proceeds from
Hurricane Katrina were partially offset by increases in fuel expense caused by
higher fuel prices and lower hedge benefits.

Other
Income

Other income decreased $6 million to
$95 million in 2006.  This change was driven primarily by lower real
estate sales, which was partially offset by an after-tax non-cash gain on
additional Conrail property value received in connection with the 2004 Conrail
spin-off transaction.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased $31 million
to $392 million in 2006 compared to the prior year.  There was lower
interest expense from lower average debt balances for 2006 (due to a $1.0
billion debt repurchase in mid-2005).  However, this savings was
partially offset by higher variable interest rates.

Income
Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased $215
million to $531 million in 2006 as a result of higher earnings.  This
increase was partially offset by the net impact of favorable resolutions of
certain tax matters in 2006 that were higher than benefits in 2005.

Net
Earnings

Net earnings for 2006 increased $165
million to $1.3 billion, with earnings per share up $.30 to $2.82 per diluted
share from the prior year.  This increase was primarily due to the
following factors:

·

Driven
      by Surface Transportation results, earnings from continuing operations
      were up $590 million, or $1.23 per diluted
  share;

·

Offsetting
      this increase was income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $425
      million, or $.93 per diluted share, as a result of the sale of CSX’s
      International Terminals business in
2005.

PART
II

vs. 2006 Rail Results of Operations

Rail
Operating Revenue

Rail
revenue is categorized by three main lines of business: merchandise, coal and
automotive.  Revenue increased $520 million, or 6%, to $8.7 billion in 2007
as compared to prior year.  CSXT was able to achieve continued pricing
gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that the
Company’s rail based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of
transportation. These pricing gains more than offset volume weakness in housing
construction, domestic automobile production and related markets.

Merchandise

Chemicals

– Revenue
and revenue per unit improved due to a continued favorable pricing
environment.  Overall volume declined slightly driven by reduced
chlorine shipments and weakness in propane demand due to a milder winter in
2007.

Emerging Markets

–
Revenue and revenue per unit grew due to continued yield management
efforts.  Volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate
shipments, such as crushed stone, sand and gravel, caused by a continued
weakness in residential construction.

Forest Products

–
Revenue and volume declined as shipments of building products and paper slowed
due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media
substitution.

Agriculture Products

– Strong domestic demand in feed ingredients and soybean shipments supported
growth in volume and revenue.  Ethanol volumes also increased as a
result of expanded use in the Northeast.  Revenue per unit grew as a
result of continued focus on yield management.

Metals

– Revenue and
revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing actions.  Lower demand
for steel due to weakness in housing construction and domestic automobile
production resulted in volume declines.

Phosphates and
Fertilizers

– Volume was flat as higher domestic demand was offset by a
decrease in export shipments.  Favorable mix driven by these volume
changes coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue
and revenue per unit.

Food and Consumer

–
Revenue and volume declines were driven by decreased demand for building
products, appliances and roofing granules, which are used to make
shingles.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Coal

Favorable
pricing positively influenced revenue and revenue per unit. Overall tonnage was
flat even though carloads slightly declined due to the use of higher capacity
cars allowing the movement of more tons with fewer cars.  Strength in
the export market was offset by weakness in utility shipments as stockpiles
remain at record high levels.

Automotive

Volume
declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production, several plant closures,
and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit
environment.  Consistent with the overall automotive market, volumes
continued to shift to foreign brands produced domestically.

Other
Rail Revenue

The
change is primarily due to increased shipments by the Company’s regional
railroads and more transloading activities associated with ethanol
shipments.

Rail
Operating Expense

Total
rail operating expenses for 2007 increased $387 million to $6.7 billion compared
to the prior year.  The description of what is included in each
category as well as significant year over year changes is described
below.

Labor and Fringe

expenses
include employee compensation and benefit programs.  These expenses
are primarily affected by inflation, headcount, wage rates, incentives earned,
healthcare plan costs, and pension and other post-retirement plan
expenses.  These expenses increased $57 million primarily due to wage
and benefit inflation, which was partially offset by improved productivity and
reduced staffing levels.

Materials, Supplies and
Other

expenses
consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain
infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at intermodal and
automotive facilities.  This category also includes costs related to
personal injury claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities,
non-locomotive fuel, property and sales taxes and professional
services.  Overall, materials, supplies and other expenses increased
by $85 million in 2007 primarily due to inflation, higher train accident related
costs and higher environmental costs.  These costs were partially
offset by $99 million of favorable personal injury reserve adjustments during
the year, which were based on management’s review of the actuarial analyses
performed by an independent actuarial firm.

This was
due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of
work-related injuries for CSXT employees since 2003.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Depreciation

expense
primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset, such as
locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life.  This
expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each
year.  This expense increased $30 million primarily due to a larger
asset base as a result of higher capital spending partially offset by lower
depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies.

Fuel

expense
includes locomotive diesel fuel.  This expense is driven by the market
price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel offset by the effects of any
hedging activities.  This expense increased $98 million primarily due
to higher fuel prices and prior year hedge benefits that were not repeated
during 2007 due to the expiration of the fuel hedge program.

Equipment and Other
Rents

primarily

includes
rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of
rents received by CSXT for use of CSXT equipment.  This category of
expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives, railcars,
containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $36
million due mainly to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases.

Inland
Transportation

expense
included in the rail segment is for amounts paid to CSXT from Intermodal for
shipments on CSXT’s network.  These intercompany charges are
eliminated in consolidated results.

Gain on Insurance
Recoveries

includes gains on insurance recoveries related to Hurricane
Katrina.  While gains were recognized in both years, the $139 million
decrease for 2007 was due to higher cash receipts for lost profits and
replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was
damaged in 2006 versus 2007.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

vs. 2006 Intermodal Results of Operations

Intermodal
operating income declined 3% or $8 million versus last year on 4% lower revenue,
partially offset by volume related cost savings.  Revenue and volume
decreases reflect losses of several International customers, the slowing of
Asian imports throughout the year and mix impact related to growth in new
short-haul domestic traffic.  Other revenue declined $22 million from
the termination of an agreement relating to the storage of containers as well as
lower general business levels. Revenue per unit declined slightly with yield
gains in the international market being offset by mix changes related to the new
short-haul domestic traffic.

Despite
rising fuel costs, Intermodal operating expense declined $48 million or 4%
driven by lower car hire expense related to volume and improved operational
efficiency.  Additionally, depreciation decreased based on the results
of a periodic review of asset useful lives.

CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

vs. 2005 Rail Results of Operations

Rail
Operating Revenue

CSXT
categorizes rail revenue in three main lines of business: merchandise, coal and
automotive.  Revenue for CSXT increased $898 million, or 12%, to $8.2
billion in 2006 from a year ago.  Continued yield management and fuel
surcharge were the primary drivers of revenue per unit gains.

Merchandise

Chemicals

– Revenue
and revenue per unit improved by capitalizing on a continued strong pricing
environment.  Overall volume was down slightly because high raw
material costs continued to negatively affect the U.S. chemical industry’s
competitiveness and in turn, CSXT volumes.

Emerging Markets

–
Growth was driven by increased shipments of municipal waste, military, and
aggregate products (which include rocks and sand).  Revenue per unit also
improved due to strong pricing actions.

Forest Products

–
Shipment of building products and printing paper slowed due to the decline in
residential housing starts and electronic media conversion.  However,
revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a favorable pricing
environment.

Agriculture Products

– Strong domestic demand in feed grain, soybean, ethanol, and export shipments
supported volume and revenue per unit. In addition, strong export demand for
grain and increased shipments of beans helped volume growth.

Metals

– Revenue and
revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing gains and fuel surcharge
coverage.  Volume increased slightly driven by strong steel demand in the
energy and non-residential construction end-markets.  These gains were
partially offset by lower demand for steel in the automotive
sector.

Phosphates and
Fertilizers

– Volume declined from lower export shipments due to
increased international phosphate production which caused several domestic
phosphate plants to close.  Favorable mix coupled with price increases
resulted in significantly improved revenue per unit.

Food and Consumer

–
Volume growth in alcoholic beverages, canned goods, and rice and beans was
offset by softness in building products, perishables, and the appliance
markets.  Strong pricing actions, and a focus on longer, more
profitable shipments increased revenue and revenue per unit.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Coal

Revenue
and volume improvements were due to increased shipments of utility and export
coal.  Utility companies built up their inventories which was a major
contributor to CSX’s volume growth.  Revenue per unit increased due to
the continued favorable pricing environment and increased fuel surcharge
coverage.

Automotive

Volume
declined due to a reduction in North American light vehicle
production.  Consistent with the overall automotive market, CSXT’s
volumes continued to shift from the Big 3 to foreign brands produced
domestically.  Revenue per unit was favorable due to price increases
and fuel surcharge.

Rail
Operating Expense

Total
rail operating expenses for 2006 increased $341 million, or 6%, to $6.3 billion
compared to the prior year.  The description of what is included in
each category as well as significant year over year changes is described
below.

Labor and Fringe

increased
$63 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation and increased staffing
in rail operations.

Materials, Supplies and
Other

expenses
increased by $113 million in 2006 primarily due to materials inflation, along
with prior year casualty favorable adjustments and supplier reimbursements that
were not repeated.  These costs were partially offset by productivity
gains from improved operations, such as efficient use of
locomotives.

Depreciation

expense
increased $39 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital
spending.

Fuel

expense
increased $329 million primarily due to reduced hedge benefit from the
expiration of the fuel hedge program as well as higher fuel prices.

Equipment and Other
Rents

expense
decreased $18 million due mainly to improvement in operational fluidity, which
drove improvements in asset utilization.

Gain on Insurance
Recoveries

was $166 million for 2006, which represented cash received for
lost profits and higher replacement value of property compared to the value of
the property that was damaged, after consideration of the Company’s insurance
deductible expensed in 2005.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

vs. 2005 Intermodal Results of Operations

Intermodal
operating income increased 8% or $20 million versus last year driven by revenue
gains of $50 million along with expense containment.  The increase in
revenue and revenue per unit was driven by the continued yield management
emphasis which was partially offset by mix of traffic. Volume increased slightly
due to continued growth of imported consumer goods from Asia as well as the
strength in the truckload market offset by weaker demand in services sold to
transportation brokers (known as wholesale markets).

Intermodal
operating expense increased $30 million primarily driven by an increase in fuel
costs that are reflected in inland transportation expense.  Fuel costs
were higher due to rising market prices.  Partially offsetting the
increase in fuel were efficiency gains related to equipment
utilization.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Liquidity

and Capital Resources

Liquidity is a company’s ability to
generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for
obligations as they mature and to provide for planned operational
growth.  In order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity,
its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be
reviewed.

Material
Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets

CSX’s
balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX’s balanced
approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which
includes reinvestment in the Company’s existing infrastructure, investments in
the future, share repurchases and dividends.

Long-term
debt increased $1.1 billion to $6.5 billion due to debt issuances in 2007 of
$2.4 billion partially offset by the conversion of a portion of convertible debt
into CSX common stock and the reclassification of debt from long-term to
current.  See the Schedule of Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments on page 50 and Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements, for additional
details.

Other
capital decreased $1.4 billion to $37 million as a result of significant share
repurchase activity partially offset by stock option exercises and the
conversion of a portion of convertible debt into CSX common
stock.  For additional information on the Company’s share repurchase
activity, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting
Policies.

Sources
and Uses of Cash

CSX has
multiple sources of cash.  First, the Company generates cash from
operations.  In 2007, CSX generated $2.2 billion of cash from
operating activities, which represented a $126 million increase from the prior
year.  Second, CSX has numerous financing sources including access to
the capital markets and a $1.25 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit
facility that expires in May 2012.  This facility can be increased by
an additional $500 million to $1.75 billion with the approval of the lending
banks.  See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more
information.

CSX also
has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC that is
unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX
Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion.
While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements,
there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such
debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Among
other things, CSX uses cash for significant annual reinvestment in
infrastructure and equipment, share repurchases and scheduled payments of debt
and leases with manageable near-term maturities.  The Company’s cash
requirements also include dividends to shareholders.

During
2007, net cash used by investing activities was $1.7 billion.  This
use of funds was predominately driven by property additions and capital
expansion projects made by the Company.  Net cash used in financing
activities was $584 million due to over $2 billion of cash used for share
repurchases during 2007, largely offset by a net increase in long-term debt
issued versus long-term debt repaid.

Dividend
payments are another use of cash.  The Company paid dividends of $231
million in 2007, which was $86 million more than prior year.  The
increase in 2007 was primarily due to the Company increasing quarterly dividends
to $0.15 per share.

Working
Capital

Working
capital can be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its
short-term needs.  CSX had a working capital deficit at December 2007
of $180 million compared to a surplus of $150 million last year driven by lower
cash and higher current debt balances in 2007.  The larger current
debt balance includes a reclassification of outstanding convertible debt with a
face value of $174 million from long-term to current during 2007.  This
reflects bondholders’ rights under the convertible debt to require CSX to
purchase the debentures in October 2008 in lieu of the later maturity
date.

A working
capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and
does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain
adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations
when they come due.  CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including
the revolving line of credit and shelf registration, to manage its day-to-day
cash requirements and any anticipated obligations.

Credit
Ratings

Credit
ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a
borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity.  The ratings
reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and
its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to
capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the
economy.  The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s
(“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to
designate their ratings.  The highest quality rating for long-term
credit obligations is AAA+ and Aaa1 for S&P and Moody’s,
respectively.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Long-term
ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect
ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered
to be “investment grade.”  Currently, the long-term ratings for CSX’s
obligations, along with the other large U.S. Class 1 freight railroads, fall
within the investment grade band of credit quality.

In 2007,
S&P and Moody’s both lowered their ratings of CSX's long-term unsecured debt
obligations from BBB and Baa2, respectively, to BBB- and Baa3,
respectively.  This was due to the Company’s announcement in second
quarter 2007 of a plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of CSX stock in
addition to the $2 billion repurchase plan announced earlier in 2007.  Both
of these agencies indicate their outlook is “Stable” and these ratings continue
to be investment grade.  CSX maintained these credit ratings through
December 2007 and does not expect that this reduction in credit ratings will
materially increase its borrowing costs or materially affect its
liquidity.  If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, the
Company could experience more significant increases in its interest cost for new
debt.  In addition, the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s
ability to readily issue new debt, could become further influenced by the
economic and credit market environment.

Critica

l Accounting Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates
in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual
results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are
discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular
basis.  Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using
management judgment are made for the following areas:

·

casualty,
      environmental and legal reserves;

·

pension
      and post-retirement medical plan
accounting;

·

depreciation
      policies for assets under the group-life method;
  and

·

income taxes

Casualty,
Environmental and Legal Reserves

Casualty

Casualty
reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury
claims.  Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the
Company’s self-insured retention amount.  To the extent the value of
an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, CSX would present
the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance
recoveries.  Personal injury and occupational claims are presented on
a gross basis and in accordance with SFAS 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

(“SFAS 5”).  These reserves fluctuate with estimates provided by
independent third parties reviewed by management, and are offset by the timing
of payments.  Most of the claims were related to CSXT unless otherwise
noted.

CORPORATION

PART

Defense
and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are
anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded
liabilities. The Company is presently self-insured for personal injury and
occupational-related claims.

Personal
Injury

Personal
injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party
injuries.  Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily
subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”).  In addition
to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various
state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Worker’s
Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.

CSXT
retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the
value of personal injury claims and cases.  An analysis is performed
by the independent actuarial firm semi-annually and is reviewed by management.
The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect
growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based
largely on CSXT’s historical claims and settlement experience.  Actual
results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury,
costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation.

Based on
management’s review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent
actuarial firm, the Company reduced personal injury reserves by $99 million
during 2007.  This reduction is due to a trend of significant
decreases in the number and severity of work-related injuries for CSXT employees
since 2003.  The analyses further indicated an absence of large
catastrophic claims since 2003, which also was determined to be a
trend.  These reductions were included in materials, supplies and
other in the consolidated income statements.

Occupational

Occupational
claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the
workplace, such as asbestos, solvents (which include soaps and chemicals) and
diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work
conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and
hearing loss.

Asbestos

The
Company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging
exposure to asbestos in the workplace.  The heaviest possible exposure
for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines
that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. However, other types of
exposures, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building
materials, continued until it was substantially eliminated by
1985.  Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos
claims filed against the previously owned international container shipping
business.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

The
Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing
asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the
value of the Company’s claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the
specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management.  The objective
of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not
reported (“IBNR”) claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received
over the next seven years.  Seven years was determined by management
to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be
estimated with more certainty.

The
Company, with the assistance of the third party specialist, determines its
potentially exposed population and it is then able to derive the estimated
number of IBNR claims. The estimated average cost per claim is then determined
utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data.
Key elements of the assessment include the following:

·

An
      estimate is computed using a ratio of Company employee data to national
      employment for select years during the period 1938-2001.  The
      Company uses railroad industry historical census data because it does not
      have detailed employment records in order to compute the population of
      potentially exposed employees.

·

The
      projected incidence of disease is estimated based on epidemiological
      studies using employees’ age and the duration and intensity of potential
      exposure while employed.  Epidemiology is the medical science
      that deals with the incidence, distribution and control of diseases in a
      population.

·

An
      estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease
      (non-malignant, cancer and mesothelioma) is computed using the Company’s
      average historical claim filing rates for a three-year calibration period,
      excluding a surge in claims originating in West Virginia.  In
      2006, the Company received 852 asbestos claims in West Virginia in which
      the claimants were neither exposed in West Virginia nor residents of the
      state.  CSX believes these claims will

not have merit as
      no medical evidence has been provided to substantiate the claims and
      therefore CSX has excluded them from the calibration
      period.  Claim levels in 2007 returned to expected levels and
      management feels this calibration period represents the best estimate of
      future filing rates.

·

An
      estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim is
      computed using the Company’s historical average dismissal rates observed
      during the current calibration period noted
  above.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

·

An
      estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease is
      computed using the Company’s historical average of dollars paid per claim
      for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of
      incident observed during the current calibration period noted
      above.

From
these assumptions, the Company projects the incidence of each type of disease to
the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees
that could potentially assert a claim. Historical claim filing rates are applied
for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially
assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by
disease type. Historical dismissal rates, which represented claims that were
closed without payment, were deducted to calculate the number of future claims
by disease type that would likely require payment by the Company. Finally, the
number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate
the Company’s future liability for IBNR asbestos claims.

The
estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most
sensitive assumptions for this reserve.  A 1% increase or decrease in
either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would
result in an approximate $1 million increase or decrease in the liability
recorded for unasserted asbestos claims.

Other
Occupational

The
Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing
other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the
Company’s claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the specialist
semi-annually and is reviewed by management.  Similar to the asbestos
liability estimation process, the key elements of the assessment include the
following:

·

An
      estimate of the potentially exposed population for other occupational
      diseases is calculated by projecting active versus retired workforce from
      2002 to 2010 using a growth rate projection for overall railroad
      employment made by the Railroad Retirement Board in its June 2003
      report.

·

An
      estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of injury,
      employee type, and active versus retired employee is computed using the
      Company’s average historical claim filing rates for the calibration
      periods management felt were representative of future filing
      rates.  For carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injuries, the
      current calibration period is a 1-year average of claim
      filings.  Hearing loss uses a 3-year calibration period, and all
      other diseases or injuries use a 2-year calibration period.  An
      estimate is made to forecast future claims by using the filing rates by
      disease and the active and retired CSX population each
    year.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

·

An
      estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of injury is
      computed using the Company’s historical average of dollars paid per claim
      for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of
      injury observed during a period that management feels is representative of
      future settlement amounts.

The
estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most
sensitive assumptions for this reserve.  A 1% increase or decrease in
either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would
not result in a material increase or decrease in the liability recorded for
unasserted other occupational claims.

Environmental

The
Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues,
including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and
regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially
responsible party (“PRP”) at approximately 247 environmentally impaired sites,
many of which were, or may be, subject to remedial action under the Federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or
CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, or similar state
statutes.  Most of these proceedings arose from environmental
conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad
operations.  However, a number of these proceedings are based on
allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to
facilities owned or operated by others for treatment or disposal.  In
addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for
commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous
substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to
proceedings against the Company.

In any
such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and
enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that
may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on
current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the
legality of the original conduct.  These costs could be
substantial.

In
accordance with Statement of Position 96-1,

Environmental Remediation
Liabilities

, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site
identified at least once a quarter, giving consideration to a number of factors
such as:

·

type
      of clean-up required;

·

nature
      of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g. generator of
      waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the
  site);



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

·

extent
      of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g. volume of waste sent to the
      location and other relevant factors);
and

·

number,
      connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed PRPs at the
      location.

Based on
the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent future
environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such
costs are estimable and probable.  The recorded liabilities for
estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include amounts
representing the Company's estimate of unasserted claims, which the Company
believes to be immaterial. The liability includes future costs for remediation
and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs,
but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries.

Currently,
the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the
amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of
future environmental studies.  In addition, conditions that are
currently unknown could, at any given location, result in exposure, the amount
and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably
estimated.  Based upon information currently available, however, the
Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial
actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate
liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Legal

In
accordance with SFAS 5, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if
information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates
that it is  probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability
has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of
loss can be reasonably estimated.  If no accrual is made for a loss
contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an
exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the
contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss
or an additional loss may have been incurred.

The
Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly
and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted
above.   The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by
factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence,
or changes in laws, regulations, and evidentiary standards.

Pension
and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting

The
Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried,
management personnel.  The plans provide eligible employees with
retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation
rates near retirement.  For employees hired after December 31, 2002,
benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits
by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and
compensation.  CSX made pension plan contributions of $266 million to
its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2007.

In
addition to these plans, CSX sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and one
life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management
employees hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain
eligibility requirements are met.  The post-retirement medical plan is
contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted
annually.  The life insurance plan is non-contributory.

The
accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R) (“

SFAS 158

”),

SFAS 87,

Employers Accounting for Pensions

(“SFAS 87”), and SFAS 106,

Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension

(“SFAS 106”).

SFAS 87 requires that management make
certain assumptions relating to the following:

·

long-term
      rate of return on plan assets;

·

discount
      rates used to measure future obligations and interest
    expense;

·

salary
      scale inflation rates;

·

health
      care cost trend rates; and

·

other
      assumptions.

These
assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year.  As
permitted by SFAS 87, the Company has elected to use a plan measurement date of
September 30 to actuarially value its pension and post-retirement
plans.  As required by SFAS 158, CSX will change its measurement date
to the fiscal year end in 2008 and does not expect the impact to be material.
The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of
liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that
the Company selects. The Company reviews the long-term rate of return, discount,
salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and
makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as
appropriate.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Long-term
Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The
expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average
rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide
for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that
rate, the Company gives

appropriate
consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and
the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment.

The
Company's expected long-term average rate of return on assets considers the
current and projected asset mix of the funds.  Management balances
market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists
with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable
estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets.  As this
assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions
used in pension accounting.  The long-term rate of return on plan
assets used by the Company to value its 2007 pension obligation was
8.5%.

Discount
Rates

Discount
rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component
of pension and post-retirement expense.  Discount rates reflect the
rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively
settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough
high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company’s expected future
benefit payments.  The Company determines the discount rate based on a
hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching the plans’
expected benefit payments.

The
discount rates used by the Company to value its 2007 pension and post-retirement
obligations are 6% and 5.75%, respectively.  The Company uses a
different discount rate for pension and post-retirement benefits due to the
different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans.  For
pensions, the time horizon is approximately 12 years, while for post-retirement,
the time horizon is approximately 8 years.

Each year these discount rates are
reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective
settlement rates.  If interest rates generally decline or rise, the
assumed discount rates will change.

Salary Scale Inflation
Rates

Salary
scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data
accumulated by the Company.  The Company reviews recent wage increases
and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its
assessment of salary scale inflation rates.  The Company used a salary
scale rate of 4.1% to value its 2007 pension obligation.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Health
Care Cost Trend Rates

Health
care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry
trends.  The Company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation
assumption for health care costs, representing increases in total plan costs
(which include claims and administrative fee cost components).  The
current assumed health care cost trend rate is 10% for Medicare-eligible
participants and 9% for non-Medicare-eligible participants and is expected to
decrease gradually until reaching 4.75% in 2014, based upon current actuarial
projections.

Other
Assumptions

The
calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to
mortality rates, turnover and retirement age.  These assumptions are
based upon historical data and are approved by management.

Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense

Net
periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2008 is expected to be
approximately $34 million and $28 million, respectively, compared to $64 million
and $25 million, respectively in 2007.

The following sensitivity analysis

Depreciation
Policies for Assets Under the Group-Life Method

CSXT
accounts for its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight
cars, using the group-life method.  The group-life method pools
similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a
whole.  Under the group-life method, the service lives for each group
of rail assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying
management's assumptions concerning the service lives of its
properties.  These life studies are conducted by a third party expert,
analyzed by the Company's management and approved by the STB.  Life
studies for equipment assets are required every three years, whereas road and
track life studies are required every six years by the STB.



CSX
CORPORATION

PART
II

Changes
in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact
future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of
operations.  Factors taken into account during the life study
include:

·

Statistical
      analysis of historical retirements for each group of
    property;

·

Evaluation
      of current operations;

·

Evaluation
      of technological advances and maintenance
  schedules;

·

Previous
      assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued
      use;

·

Expected
      net salvage to be received upon retirement;
and

·

Comparison
      of assets to the same asset groups with other
  companies.

The life
studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation
is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study.
Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation
expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next
required life study.

In 2007,
CSXT completed life studies for all of its equipment, road and track assets and
also completed an analysis of the assets received in the Conrail reorganization,
which resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense for equipment and road
assets and an increase in depreciation expense for track assets.  The
combination of these adjustments reduced depreciation expense by $21 million in
2007.  Also in 2007, the Company reviewed the useful lives of
Intermodal terminal assets, as well as lift equipment and
containers.  A $4 million reduction in depreciation expense was
recognized as a result of this periodic review.

Assets
depreciated under the group-life method comprise 91% of CSXT's total fixed
assets of $21 billion on a net basis at December 28, 2007. The Company’s
depreciation expense for the year ended December 28, 2007 amounted to $883
million.  A one percent change in the average life of all group-life
assets would result in an $8 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation
expense.



CSX

PART
II

Income
Taxes

In 2006,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FIN 48, which became effective
for CSX beginning in 2007.  FIN 48 addressed the determination of how
tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be
recorded in the financial statements.  Under FIN 48, the Company must
recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.  The
tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.  The Company’s
reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with FIN 48 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity.

CSX files a consolidated federal income
tax return, which includes its principal domestic
subsidiaries.  Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX
have been completed through 2003.  Federal income tax returns for 2004
through 2007 currently are under examination.  Management believes
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be
assessed.  While the final outcome of these matters cannot be
predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these
items will have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity of CSX.  An unexpected adverse
resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a materially
adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity
in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year.  Also, the Company is
party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings, the resolution of
which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular fiscal
quarter or fiscal year.

7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk

CSX does
not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes.  Historically, the Company has used derivative financial
instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs, but as of December 2007, the
Company did not have a significant position in derivative financial
instruments.

At
December 2007, CSX had $106 million of outstanding floating rate debt
obligations outstanding.  A 1% fluctuation in interest rates on these
notes would cause a $1 million change in interest expense.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE
1.  Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting
Policies

Nature
of Operations

CSX
Corporation (“CSX” and together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), based in
Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation
companies.  Surface Transportation, which includes the Company’s rail
and intermodal businesses, provides rail-based transportation services including
traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and
trailers.

Rail

CSX’s
principal operating company, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides a
crucial link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 21,000
route mile rail network, which serves every major population center in 23 states
east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian
provinces of Ontario and Quebec.  It serves 70 ocean, river and lake ports
along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and
the St. Lawrence Seaway.  CSXT also serves thousands of production and
distribution facilities through track connections to more than 230 short-line
and regional railroads.

Other
Entities

In
addition to CSXT, the rail segment includes Total Distribution Services, Inc.
(“TDSI”), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (“Transflo”), CSX Technology, Inc.
(“CSX Technology”) and other subsidiaries.  TDSI serves the automotive
industry with distribution centers and storage locations, while Transflo
provides logistical solutions for transferring products from rail to
trucks.  Technology and other support services are provided by CSX
Technology and other subsidiaries.

Intermodal

CSX
Intermodal, Inc. (“Intermodal”), one of the nation’s largest coast-to-coast
intermodal transportation providers,

is a stand-alone,
integrated intermodal company linking customers to railroads via trucks and
terminals.  Containers and trailers are loaded and unloaded from
trains, and trucks provide the link between intermodal terminals and the
customer.

Surface
Transportation Businesses

The rail
and intermodal segments are designated by the Company on a combined basis as
Surface Transportation businesses.  Together, they generated $10
billion of revenue during 2007 and served four primary lines of business, which
are as follows:

continued

·

The
      merchandise business is the most diverse market with nearly 2.7 million
      carloads per year of aggregate, which includes crushed stone, sand and
      gravel, metal, phosphate, fertilizer, food, consumer, agricultural, paper
      and chemical products.  The merchandise business generated
      approximately 50% of the Company’s revenue in 2007 and 38% of
      volume.

·

Coal,
      which delivered approximately 1.9 million carloads of coal, coke and iron
      ore to electricity generating power plants, ocean, river and lake piers
      and terminals, steel makers and industrial plants, accounted for
      approximately 26% of the Company’s revenue and volume in
      2007.  The Company transports almost one-third of every ton of
      coal used for generating electricity in the areas served by
      CSX.

·

Automotive,
      which delivers both finished vehicles and auto parts, generated 8% of the
      Company’s revenue in 2007 and 6% of the Company’s volume.  The
      Company delivers approximately one-third of North America’s light
      vehicles, serving both traditional manufacturers and the increasing number
      of global manufacturers.

·

Intermodal
      offers a competitive cost advantage over long-haul trucking by combining
      the superior economics of rail transportation with the short-haul
      flexibility of trucks.  Through its network of more than 50
      terminals, Intermodal serves all major markets east of the Mississippi and
      transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, providing
      customers with truck-like service for longer shipments.  For
      2007, Intermodal accounted for approximately 14% of the Company’s total
      revenue and 30% of volume.

Other revenue, which includes revenue
from regional railroads (that are partially owned by CSX), demurrage, switching
and other incidental charges, accounted for 2% of the Company’s total 2007
revenue.  Revenue from regional railroads includes shipments by
railroads that CSX does not directly operate.  Demurrage represents
charges assessed by railroads when shippers or receivers of freight hold
railcars beyond a specified period of time.  Switching revenue is
generated when CSXT switches cars between trains for a customer or another
railroad.

Other
Businesses

CSX’s
other holdings include CSX Real Property, Inc., a subsidiary responsible for the
Company’s real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development
activities, and CSX Hotels, Inc., a resort doing business as The Greenbrier,
located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.  Pretax earnings of
$42 million, $24 million and $85 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
from these activities are classified as a component of other
income.  These items are classified in other income because they are
not considered by the Company to be operating activities and may fluctuate with
the timing of real estate sales and resort seasonality.

NOTE
1.  Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies,

The
Company also has certain residual activities from formerly owned companies that
include leasing of equipment and vessels.  These results are included
in consolidated operating income and totaled $5 million, $12 million and $1
million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Basis
of Presentation

In the
opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
contain all normal, recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the
financial position of CSX and its subsidiaries at December 2007 and December
2006, and the Consolidated Statements of Income, Cash Flows  and
Changes in Shareholders’ Equity for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and
2005.  Certain prior-year data have been reclassified to conform to
the 2007 presentation.

Fiscal
Year

CSX
follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar.  This fiscal calendar
allows every quarter to consistently end on a Friday and to be of equal duration
(13 weeks).  However, to maintain this type of reporting calendar,
every sixth or seventh year (depending on the Gregorian calendar and when leap
year falls), an extra week will be included in one quarter (a 14-week fiscal
quarter) and, therefore, the full fiscal year will have 53 weeks.

Fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 each
consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 28, 2007, December 29, 2006 and
December 30, 2005, respectively.  Except as otherwise specified,
references to full year indicate CSX’s fiscal periods ended on these
dates.

Principles
of Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include results of operations of CSX and its
majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. Most investments in companies that were not
majority-owned were carried at cost (if less than 20% owned and the Company has
no significant influence) or equity (if the Company has significant
influence).

Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

On a
daily basis, cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in
various highly liquid investments having a typical maturity date of three months
or less at the date of acquisition. These investments were carried at cost,
which approximated market value, and were classified as cash equivalents.
Investments in instruments with maturities greater than three months but less
than one year were classified as short-term investments.



CSX

CSX holds $270 million and $391 million
of auction rate securities and classifies these investments as available for
sale as of December 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Accordingly, these
investments were included in current assets as Short-term Investments on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  On the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statements, purchases and sales of these assets were classified within Investing
Activities.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts for the estimated probable losses on uncollectible accounts
and other receivables. The allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of
customers, historical experience, the age of the receivable and current market
and economic conditions, as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to
customer billing and account collectibility. Uncollectible amounts were charged
against the allowance account. The allowance for doubtful accounts is netted
against accounts receivable.

Materials
and Supplies

Materials and Supplies in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets were carried at average costs and consist primarily
of fuel and parts used in the repair and maintenance of CSXT’s freight car and
locomotive fleets, equipment and track structure.

Properties

All
properties were stated at historical cost less an allowance for accumulated
depreciation. Rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight
cars, were depreciated using the group-life method.  Under this
method, CSXT pools similar assets by road and equipment type and then
depreciates each group as a whole.  Regulations enforced by the
Surface Transportation Board (“STB”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation
require periodic formal studies of ultimate service lives (“life studies”) for
all railroad assets. Factors taken into account during a life study
include:

·

statistical
      analysis of historical retirements for each group of
    property;

·

evaluation
      of current operations;

·

evaluation
      of technological advances and maintenance
  schedules;

·

previous
      assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued
      use;

·

net
      salvage expected to be received upon retirement;
  and

·

comparison
      of assets to the same asset groups with other
  companies.



CSX

NOTE
1.  Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies,

The
results of the life study process determine the service lives for each asset
group under the group-life method. These studies are conducted by a third party
expert and are analyzed by the Company's management. Resulting changes in
service life estimates are subject to review and approval by the STB. Road
assets, including main-line track, have estimated service lives ranging from six
years for system roadway machinery to 80 years for grading. Equipment assets,
including locomotives and freight cars, have estimated service lives ranging
from six years for motor vehicles to 35 years for work equipment.

Changes in asset lives due to the
results of the life studies are applied at the completion of the life study and
continue until the next required life study. The life studies may also indicate
that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess)
of the amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) amount is
amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life
of the asset group until the next required life study.

The
majority of non-rail property is depreciated using the straight-line method on a
per asset basis.  The depreciable lives of non-rail property is
periodically reviewed by the Company and any changes are applied on a
prospective basis.  Amortization expense recorded under capital leases
is included in depreciation expense on the Consolidated Income
Statements.

For
retirements or disposals of depreciable rail assets that occur in the ordinary
course of business, the asset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is
charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. For
retirements or disposals of non-rail depreciable assets, infrequent disposal of
rail assets outside the normal course of business and all dispositions of land,
the resulting gains or losses are recognized at the time of disposal.
Expenditures that significantly increase asset values or extend useful lives are
capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to operating
expense when the work is performed.

Properties and other long-lived assets
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or business conditions indicate the
carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Initial assessments
of recoverability are based on estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows
associated with an asset or a group of assets in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.  Where impairment is indicated,
the assets are evaluated and their carrying amount is reduced to fair value
based on undiscounted net cash flows or other estimates of fair
value.

Revenue
and Expense Recognition

The Company recognizes freight revenue
using Free-On-Board (“FOB”) Origin pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) 91-9,

Revenue and
Expense Recognition for Freight Services in Process

.  The
Company uses method (5) in the EITF, which provides for the allocation of
revenue between reporting periods based on relative transit time in each
reporting period.  Expenses are recognized as incurred.

NOTE
1.  Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies,

The
certain key estimates included in the recognition and measurement of revenue and
related accounts receivable under the policies described above are as
follows:

·

revenue
      associated with shipments in transit, which are based on historical
      freight car movement data as well as average cycle times to move
      commodities from their origin to their final destination or
      interchange;

·

future
      adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing corrections,
      billing discounts, bad debts and allowances for doubtful
      accounts;

·

future
      adjustments to revenue for overcharge claims filed by customers, which are
      based on historical cash paid to customers for rate overcharges as a
      percentage of total billing; and

·

incentive-based
      refunds to customers, which are primarily based on customers achieving
      certain volume thresholds and are recorded as a reduction to revenue on
      the basis of management’s best estimate of the projected
      liability.  This estimate is based on historical activity,
      current volume levels and a forecast of future
  volume.

The Company regularly updates the
estimates described above based on historical experience.  All other
revenue, such as demurrage, switching and other incidental charges are recorded
upon completion of the service.

Comprehensive
Earnings

CSX
reports comprehensive earnings (loss) in accordance with SFAS 130,

Reporting Comprehensive
Income

, in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders'
Equity.  Comprehensive earnings is defined as all changes in
shareholders' equity during a period, other than those resulting from
investments by and distributions to shareholders (i.e. issuance of equity
securities and dividends).  At December 2007 and 2006, Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Loss consisted primarily of adjustments for pension and
other post-retirement liabilities.  (See Note 8, Employee Benefit
Plans.)

Derivative
Financial Instruments

CSX
recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value.  (See
Note 14, Derivative Financial Instruments.)

New
Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy

CSX
adopted FASB Interpretation 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes

(“FIN 48”), at the beginning of fiscal year 2007.  FIN 48
addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be
claimed on an income tax return should be recorded in the financial
statements.  Under FIN 48, the Company must recognize the tax benefit
from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on
the technical merits of the position.  These tax benefits recognized
in the financial statements are measured based on the largest benefit that has a
greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
resolution.  The impact of the Company’s reassessment of its tax
positions in accordance with FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  (See Note
13, Income Taxes.)

In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS
158,

Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R)

(“SFAS 158”), which changed the
accounting rules for reporting and disclosures related to pensions and other
post-retirement benefit plans. Companies were required to reflect the funded
status of retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans on the balance
sheet. This change was effective for the Company for fiscal year end
2006.  The decrease in equity did not have any significant impact on
the Company’s credit ratios or financing covenants.  Pursuant to SFAS 158,
the Company will be required to change its September measurement date for the
Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets and obligations
to its fiscal year end effective in 2008.

Effective
fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS 123(R),

Share-Based
Payment

(“SFAS 123(R)”) using the modified-prospective-transition
method.  Under this method, compensation costs recognized in 2006 and
forward include all unvested share-based payments as of the beginning of
2006.  Share-based compensation at CSX may include stock options,
restricted stock awards, stock issued to CSX directors and CSX’s Long-term
Incentive Plans.  The amount of compensation costs recognized is based
upon the estimated grant date fair value method under the Black-Scholes-Merton
formula and resulted in the recognition of additional compensation cost from the
unvested portion of stock options granted prior to 2003.

The
adoption of SFAS 123(R) did not result in a material impact to the Company’s
Consolidated Income Statement or earnings per share.  The Company
recorded $3 million in 2006 of additional compensation expense for unvested
stock options granted prior to 2003.  Compensation costs for all other
types of share-based payments were consistently reported for all periods
presented.

In 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”), and the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
159,

The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”).  These
statements define fair value, provide guidance on fair value measurement and
give companies the option to report financial instruments and certain other
items at fair value.  CSX does not expect to be materially impacted by
these statements.

In 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements- An amendment of ARB No. 51

(“

S

FAS 160”).

This statement
clarifies that minority interest should be reported as equity on the balance
sheet.  Additionally, it requires disclosure of consolidated net
income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest on the
face of the income statement. For CSX, SFAS 160 is effective beginning fiscal
year 2009 and the Company does not expect to be materially impacted by this
statement.

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues
and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ
from those estimates.  Critical accounting estimates using management
judgment are made for the following areas:

·

casualty,
      environmental and legal reserves (see Note 6, Casualty, Environmental and
      Other Reserves);

·

pension
      and post-retirement medical plan accounting (see Note 8, Employee Benefit
      Plans);

·

depreciation
      policies for assets under the group-life method (see “Properties” in this
      note); and

·

income
      taxes (see Note 13, Income Taxes).

Other
Items – Share Repurchases

Currently, CSX has purchased $2.1
billion of its outstanding common stock, which represents 50 million shares or
about 70% of the $3 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in
2007.  CSX intends to complete this repurchase program during
2008.  The timing, method, amount of repurchase transactions and the
sources of funds to affect any repurchases will be determined by the Company's
management based on their evaluation of market conditions, share price and other
factors. While it is not management’s intention, the program could be suspended
or discontinued at any time

NOTE
2.  Earnings Per Share, continued

Basic
earnings per share was based on the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding.  Earnings per share, assuming dilution, was based on the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of
the following types of potentially dilutive common shares:

·

convertible
      debt;

·

employee
      stock options; and

·

other
      equity awards, which include unvested restricted stock and long-term
      incentive awards.

EITF 04-8,

The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share

, required CSX to include
additional shares in the computation of earnings per share, assuming
dilution.  The amount included in diluted earnings per share
represents the number of shares that would be issued if all of CSX’s convertible
debentures were converted into CSX common stock.

When
convertible debentures are converted into CSX common stock, the newly-issued
shares are included in the calculation of both basic and diluted earnings per
share on a weighted average basis.  During 2007, $375 million of face value
convertible debentures were converted into 13 million shares of CSX common
stock.  No material conversions occurred during 2006.  At
December 2007, $174 million face value remained outstanding, convertible into 6
million shares.

In 2005,
4.4 million stock options with an average exercise price of $26.55 were excluded
from the computation of earnings per share, assuming dilution, since their
related option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the
common shares during the period.  In 2006 and 2007, no stock options
were excluded from the calculation as all stock options were dilutive at that
time.

4.  Stock Plans and Share-Based Compensation

CSX
share-based compensation plans primarily include long-term incentive plans,
restricted stock awards, stock options and stock plans for
directors.  CSX has not granted stock options since
2003.  Awards granted under the various plans are determined and
approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or, in certain
circumstances, by the Chief Executive Officer for awards to management employees
other than senior executives.  The Governance Committee of the Board
of Directors approves awards granted to the Company’s non-management
directors.

As of December 2007, there were 2,393
current or former employees with stock option grants outstanding under the
various plans.  Most new stock awards were granted under the
authorization provided in the CSX Omnibus Incentive Plan.  As of December
2007, an additional 12 million shares of stock could be issued under this
plan.

SFAS 123(R) requires the cash flows
resulting from income tax deductions in excess of compensation costs to be
classified as financing cash flows.  This requirement resulted in
reduced net operating cash flows and increased net financing cash flows of
approximately $60 million and $59 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006,
respectively.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), CSX presented all
income tax benefits from deductions resulting from compensation costs as
operating cash flows in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statements.

Long-term
Incentive Plans

The CSX
Long-term Incentive Plans were adopted under the CSX Omnibus Incentive Plan. The
objective of these long-term incentive plans is to motivate and reward key
members of management and executives for achieving and exceeding certain
strategic initiatives.

In 2007,
performance units were granted to certain layers of management under a new
long-term incentive plan adopted under the CSX Omnibus Incentive
Plan.  This plan provides for a three-year cycle ending in fiscal year
2009.  The key financial target is Surface Transportation operating
ratio, which is defined as annual operating expenses divided by revenue of the
Company’s rail and intermodal businesses and is calculated excluding certain
non-recurring items. Grants were made in performance units and are payable in
CSX common stock.  The payout range for the majority of participants
will be between 0% and 200% of the original grant, with each unit being
equivalent to one share of CSX stock.  The payout for certain senior
executive officers is subject to a 20% increase or decrease based upon certain
additional pre-established financial targets.  This could result in a
maximum payout of 240% of the original grant.  However, any payout to
certain senior executive officers is also subject to a reduction of up to 30% at
the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors based
upon Company performance against certain CSX strategic
initiatives.  Units in the plan have a weighted average grant date
fair value of $43.33, which includes the value of both the initial grant and
subsequent, smaller grants issued at different prices based on grant date fair
value to new or promoted employees not previously included.

In 2006,
grants under two long-term incentive plans were made in the form of performance
units.  One of the plans provided for a two-year cycle ending in
fiscal year 2007 and the other plan provided for a three-year cycle ending in
fiscal year 2008.    The terms for these plans are substantially
similar to the 2007 plan.  Units in the plans have a weighted average
grant date fair value of $36.86, which includes the value of both the initial
grant and subsequent, smaller grants at different prices to new or promoted
employees not previously included.  One of the 2006 plans ended on
December 28, 2007, and CSX issued 1.4 million net shares in 2008 as a result of
the achievement of performance targets for the two preceding fiscal years, which
had a net market value of $58 million.

CSX also issued 1.5 million shares in
2006 related to the expiration of the 2004/2005 long-term incentive plan. The
objective of the 2004/2005 plan was to motivate and reward key members of
management and executives for achieving and exceeding a two-year modified free
cash flow goal, and the award was paid in cash and CSX common
stock.

Plan for Directors

The Stock
Plan for Directors, approved by the shareholders in 1992, governs in part the
manner in which directors' fees and retainers were paid.  At the end
of 2007, the minimum retainer to be paid in CSX common stock was 50% of the
annual retainer, but each director may elect to receive the entire retainer and
fees in CSX common stock.  In addition, each director receives an
annual payment made entirely in CSX common stock. The following table provides

fees.  Deferred cash amounts were credited to an account and invested
in a choice of eight investment selections, including a CSX common stock
equivalent fund.  Distributions were made in accordance with elections

5.  Hurricane Katrina

In August
2005, Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage to Company assets on the Gulf
Coast including damage to track infrastructure and
bridges.  Operations were returned to pre-hurricane conditions by the
end of the first quarter of 2006.

In order
to determine the proper accounting treatment for the damage, the Company
reviewed EITF 01-10,

Accounting for the Impact of the
Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001

, specifically Issue 3, of that
consensus, in which the Task Force concluded that insurance recoveries in
connection with property and casualty losses should be recognized when
realization of the claim for recovery of a loss recognized in the financial
statements is deemed probable.  Information regarding the Company’s
insurance coverage at that time, damage estimates and the allocation of the
insurance deductible is as follows:

Insurance
Coverage

In 2005,
the Company had insurance coverage of $535 million, after a $25 million
deductible (per occurrence), for the following types of losses:

·

Fixed Assets
      Damages

- CSX is entitled to the current replacement cost of the
      damaged assets.  The Company’s bridges and track damaged by
      Hurricane Katrina comprised the majority of these types of
      losses.

·

Business
      Interruption

- The Company is entitled to recover the increased
      costs incurred to allow the Company to continue operations and to minimize
      the overall business impact to the Company during the period of
      indemnity.  These increased costs include rerouting and other
      costs.

·

Lost Profit

-
      The Company is entitled to recover lost profits, net of associated
      expenses, during the period of indemnity. The period of indemnity is
      defined in the relevant policies of insurance and extends not only through
      the date upon which the railroad network was restored to its original
      operations, but for such additional time as may be required to
      restore revenue to the same level as would have existed had no loss
      occurred.

The Company’s insurance policies do not
prioritize coverage based on types of losses.  As claims were
submitted to the insurance companies, they were reviewed and preliminary
payments were received until all losses were incurred and
documented.  A final payment will be received once the Company and its
insurers agree on the total value of the claim.

Damage
Estimates

Management’s
current loss estimate is approximately $450 million.  Damages are
categorized as follows:

·

Fixed Asset
      Damages

- The cost estimate was based on the replacement value of
      approximately 39 miles of continuous track, six major bridges, numerous
      small bridges, signal and communication damage, locomotive repair and
      facilities damaged throughout the
region.

·

Incremental
      Expenses

- The Company’s incremental expenses relate primarily to
      rerouting and other costs.  Rerouting costs are costs to move
      traffic either through alternative locations on the Company’s network or
      on other railroad lines.  Other costs include debris removal,
      maintenance on equipment damaged by water, supplies, environmental
      expenses, maintenance labor and other various
  items.

·

Lost Profit

-
      The Company estimated the impact on revenue at a location and
      customer-specific level.

Allocation
of Deductible

The Company’s insurance policies
required its participation in the first $25 million of each loss event, without
regard to the category of the covered losses.  Because the Company’s
insurance policies do not specifically apply the deductible by the types of
losses covered, CSX believes it is inconsistent with the form and economic
substance of the Company’s policies to attribute the entire deductible to a
single component of covered losses.  Therefore, the Company allocated
the $25 million self-insured deductible among the above three categories of
losses in proportion to the best estimate of the total ultimate losses eligible
for recovery under the Company’s insurance policies.

Gain
on Insurance Recoveries

As of
December 2007, the Company has collected $367 million of insurance proceeds and
recognized $195 million of pre-tax gains for claims related to Hurricane
Katrina.  The gains were attributable to recovering amounts in excess
of the net book value of damaged fixed assets and to recording recoveries
related to lost profits.  Additional cash proceeds are expected and
will result in future gain recognition.

Details

and SFAS 5,

(“SFAS 5”), were not recognized until the period in which all
contingencies were resolved or cash proceeds were received.  The
insurance recovery for the replacement cost of property damage in excess of book
value and the recovery of lost profits were considered to be gain
contingencies.  Therefore the net gain (after applying the insurance
deductible) was deferred until the cash proceeds are/were received.

In
measuring the losses incurred in 2005 attributed to Hurricane Katrina, the
Company considered the actual losses reflected in the financial statements and
the allocable deductible (based on expected total recoveries from insured
losses), and recorded a receivable for the difference based on probable
insurance recoveries at December 30, 2005.  No receivables were
recorded at the end of fiscal year 2007 or 2006 because cash proceeds exceeded
the net book value of fixed asset damage and incremental expenses that were
paid.

Cash
Flows

Cash
proceeds from the insurers are not specific to the types of losses and so, for
cash flow presentation, the Company allocated the proceeds ratably among the
three types of losses mentioned above.  Allocated cash proceeds for
lost profits and incremental expenses were classified as operating activities
since they related directly to revenue and expenses from operations and were $13
million, $121 million and $29 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.  Allocated cash proceeds for fixed asset damage were
classified as investing activities since these proceeds had a direct
relationship to money the Company spent on property additions to repair the
hurricane-damaged assets that were recorded in the same
category.  Cash proceeds for fixed asset damage were $16 million, $147
million and $41 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Details with respect to each type of
reserve are described below.  Actual settlements and claims received
could differ.  The final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted
with certainty.  Considering the legal defenses available, the
liabilities that have been recorded and other factors, it is the opinion of
management that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a material
effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity.  However, should a number of these items occur in the same
period, they could have a material effect on the results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal
year.

Casualty

Casualty reserves represent accruals
for personal injury and occupational injury claims.  Currently, no
individual claim is expected to exceed the Company’s self-insured retention
amount of $25 million.  To the extent the value of an individual claim
exceeds the self-insured retention amount, CSX would present the liability on a
gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance
recoveries.  Personal injury and occupational claims are presented on
a gross basis and in accordance with SFAS 5.  These reserves fluctuate
with independent third party estimates, which are reviewed by management, and
the timing of payments.  Most of the claims were related to CSXT
unless otherwise noted.

Defense
and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are
anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded
liabilities. The Company is presently self-insured for personal injury and
occupational-related claims.

Personal
Injury

Personal
injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party
injuries.  Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily
subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”).  In addition
to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various
state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’
Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act.

CSXT
retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the
value of personal injury claims and cases.  An analysis is performed
by the independent actuarial firm semi-annually and is reviewed by management.
The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect
growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based
largely on CSXT’s historical claims and settlement experience.  Actual
results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury,
costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation.  Reserves
for personal injury claims were $338 million and $424 million at December 2007
and December 2006, respectively.

During
2007, the Company reduced personal injury reserves by $99 million based on
management’s review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent
actuarial firm.  This reduction is due to a trend of significant
decreases in the number and severity of work-related injuries for CSXT employees
since 2003.  The analyses further indicated a reduction of large
catastrophic claims since 2003, which also was determined to be a
trend.  These reductions were included in materials, supplies and
other in the Consolidated Income Statements.

Occupational

Occupational
claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the
workplace, such as asbestos, solvents (which include soaps and chemicals) and
diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work
conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and
hearing loss.

Reserves for asbestos related claims
were $129 million and $121 million at December 2007 and December 2006,
respectively.  Reserves for all other occupational claims were $79
million and $92 million at December 2007 and December 2006,
respectively.

Asbestos

The Company is party to a number of
occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the
workplace.  The heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to
work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased
out beginning around the 1950s. However, other types of exposures, including
exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until
it was substantially eliminated by 1985.  Additionally, the Company
has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against its previously owned
international container shipping business.

The
Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing
asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the
value of the Company’s claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the
specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management.  The objective
of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not
reported (“IBNR”) claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received
over the next seven years.  Seven years was determined by management
to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be
estimated with more certainty.

The
Company, with the assistance of the third party specialist, determines its
potentially exposed population and is then able to calculate the estimated
number of IBNR claims. The estimated average cost per claim is then determined
utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data.
Key elements of the assessment include the following:

·

An
      estimate is computed using a ratio of Company employee data to national
      employment for select years during the period 1938-2001.  The
      Company uses railroad industry historical census data because it does not
      have detailed employment records in order to compute the population of
      potentially exposed employees.

·

The
      projected incidence of disease is estimated based on epidemiological
      studies using employees’ age and the duration and intensity of potential
      exposure while employed.  Epidemiology is the medical science
      that deals with the incidence, distribution and control of diseases in a
      population.

·

An
      estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease
      (non-malignant, cancer and mesothelioma) is computed using the Company’s
      average historical claim filing rates for a three-year calibration period,
      excluding a surge in claims originating in West Virginia.  In
      2006, the Company received 852 asbestos claims in West Virginia in which
      the claimants were neither exposed in West Virginia nor residents of the
      state.  CSX believes these claims will

not have merit as
      no medical evidence has been provided to substantiate the claims and
      therefore CSX has excluded them from the calibration
      period.  Claim levels in 2007 returned to expected levels and
      management feels this calibration period represents the best estimate of
      future filing rates.

·

An
      estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim is
      computed using the Company’s historical average dismissal rates observed
      during the current calibration period noted
  above.

·

An
      estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease is
      computed using the Company’s historical average of dollars paid per claim
      for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of
      incident observed during the current calibration period noted
      above.

From
these assumptions, the Company projects the incidence of each type of disease to
the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees
that could potentially assert a claim. Historical claim filing rates were
applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could
potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim
filings by disease type. Historical dismissal rates, which represented claims
that were closed without payment, were deducted to calculate the number of
future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the Company.
Finally, the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement
value to estimate the Company’s future liability for IBNR asbestos
claims.

The
estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values were the most
sensitive assumptions for this reserve.  A 1% increase or decrease in
either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would
result in an approximate $1 million increase or decrease in the liability
recorded for unasserted asbestos claims.

Undiscounted liabilities recorded
related to asbestos claims were as follows:

In 2005, management updated its
estimate of the IBNR liability exposure with the assistance of the third party
specialists, which resulted in recognition of a $48 million favorable change
associated with asbestos liabilities (a net $38 million favorable change for all
occupational liabilities).  During 2004 and 2005, asbestos related
disease claims filed against the Company dropped substantially, particularly
bulk claims filed by certain law firms.  In 2003, the Company received
a significant number of filings.  The Company believes the high 2003
number was attributable to an attempt to file before a new, more restrictive
venue law took effect in West Virginia in mid-2003.  As a result,
management reassessed the calibration period from a four-year average to a
three-year average in 2005, excluding the surge in claims originating in West
Virginia.  Management believes this calibration period represents the
best estimate of future filing rates.  There have been no changes to
the number of years used in the calibration period since 2005.

Other
Occupational

The
Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing
other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the
Company’s claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the specialist
semi-annually and is reviewed by management.  Similar to the asbestos
liability estimation process, the key elements of the assessment include the
following:

·

An
      estimate of the potentially exposed population for other occupational
      diseases is calculated by projecting active versus retired workforce from
      2002 to 2010 using a growth rate projection for overall railroad
      employment made by the Railroad Retirement Board in its June 2003
      report.

·

An
      estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of injury,
      employee type and active versus retired employee is computed using the
      Company’s average historical claim filing rates for the calibration
      periods management felt were representative of future filing
      rates.  For carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injuries, the
      current calibration period is a 1-year average of claim
      filings.  Hearing loss uses a 3-year calibration period, and all
      other diseases or injuries use a 2-year calibration period.  An
      estimate is made to forecast future claims by using the filing rates by
      disease and the active and retired Company population each
      year.

Approximately 6,000 of the open claims
at December 2007 were asbestos claims against CSX’s previously owned
international container shipping business.  Because these claims were
against multiple vessel owners, the Company’s reserves reflect its portion of
those claims.  The Company had approximately $9 million reserved for
these shipping business claims at December 2007 and 2006.  The
remaining open claims were asserted against CSXT.

Separation

Separation
liabilities provide for the estimated costs of implementing workforce
reductions, improvements in productivity and certain other cost reductions at
the Company's major transportation units since 1991. These liabilities are
expected to be paid out over the next 15 to 20 years from general corporate
funds and may fluctuate depending on the timing of payments and associated
taxes.

Environmental

The
Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues,
including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and
regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially
responsible party at approximately 247 environmentally impaired sites, many of
which were, or may be, subject to remedial action under the Federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or
CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, or similar state
statutes.  Most of these proceedings arose from environmental
conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad
operations.  However, a number of these proceedings are based on
allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to
facilities owned or operated by others for treatment or disposal.  In
addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for
commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous
substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to
proceedings against the Company.

In any
such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and
enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that
may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on
current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the
legality of the original conduct.  These costs could be
substantial.

In
accordance with Statement of Position 96-1,

Environmental Remediation
Liabilities

, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site
identified at least once a quarter.  Based on the review process, the
Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent future environmental
remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are
estimable and probable.  The recorded liabilities for estimated future
environmental costs are undiscounted and include amounts representing the
Company's estimate of unasserted claims, which the Company believes to be
immaterial. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration
of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any
anticipated insurance recoveries.  Payments related to these
liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years.

Currently,
the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the
amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of
future environmental studies.  In addition, conditions that are
currently unknown could, at any given location, result in exposure, the amount
and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably
estimated.  Based upon information currently available, however, the
Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial
actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate
liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Other

Other reserves of $122 million and $93
million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, include liabilities for various claims,
such as longshoremen disability claims, freight claims and claims for property,
automobile and general liability.  These liabilities are accrued at
the estimable and probable amount in accordance with SFAS 5.

Longshoremen
disability claims represent liability for assessments under Section 8f of the
United States Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation
Program.  These reserves have amounts accrued for second injury fund
liabilities, which represent the non-medical portion of employee claims which
are paid by the United States Department of Labor and are attributed to an
earlier injury to the same employee.

Freight claims represent claims for
both freight loss and damage and freight rate disputes.  Freight loss
and damage claims are liabilities that resulted from the loss or damage of
customer freight while being handled by the Company’s transportation
services.  Freight rate disputes represent liabilities for customer
claims regarding the rate charged by the Company for its transportation
services.  Liabilities for freight rate disputes are recorded as a
reduction of revenue.

locomotives.  The agreement is based on the maintenance cycle for each
locomotive.  Under CSXT’s current obligations, the agreement will
expire no earlier than 2028 and may last until 2031 depending upon when certain
locomotives are placed in service.  The costs expected to be incurred
throughout the duration of the agreement fluctuate as locomotives are placed
into, or removed from, service or as required maintenance schedules are

Company property damage and business interruption, with substantial
limits.  A specific amount of risk is retained by the Company on each of
the casualty and property programs.  Specifically, the Company has a $25
million deductible for each of the casualty and non-catastrophic property
programs and a $50 million deductible for the catastrophic property
program.  This deductible only applies to the first event.  If an
event occurs in excess of the Company’s deductible and the Company does not
elect to purchase additional insurance coverage, then the deductible for the
second covered event will equal the amount of the claim in the first
event.

Guarantees

CSX and certain of its subsidiaries are
contingently liable, individually and jointly with others, as guarantors of
approximately $72 million in obligations principally relating to leased
equipment, vessels and joint facilities used by the Company in its current and
former business operations.  Utilizing the Company’s guarantee for
these obligations allows the obligor to take advantage of lower interest rates
and to obtain other favorable terms.  Guarantees are contingent
commitments issued by the Company that could require CSX or one of its
affiliates to make payment to or to perform certain actions for the beneficiary
of the guarantee based on another entity’s failure to perform.

Guarantee
      of approximately $61 million of obligations of a former subsidiary, CSX
      Energy, in connection with a sale-leaseback transaction.  CSX is, in
      turn, indemnified by several subsequent owners of the subsidiary against
      payments made with respect to this guarantee.  Management does not
      expect that the Company will be required to make any payments under this
      guarantee for which CSX will not be reimbursed. CSX’s obligation for this
      guarantee will be completed in
2012.

·

Guarantee
      of approximately $11 million of lease commitments assumed by A.P.
      Moller-Maersk (“Maersk”) for which CSX is contingently liable.  CSX
      believes Maersk will fulfill its contractual commitments with respect to
      such lease commitments and CSX will have no further liability for those
      obligations.  CSX’s obligation under this guarantee will be
      completed in 2011.

As of December 2007, the Company had
not recognized any liabilities in its financial statements in connection with
any guarantee arrangements.  The maximum amount of future payments the
Company could be required to make under these guarantees is the amount of the
guarantees themselves.

Fuel
Surcharge Antitrust Litigation

Since May
2007, at least 28 putative class action suits were filed in various federal
district courts against CSXT and the four other U.S.-based Class I
railroads.  The lawsuits contain substantially similar allegations to
the effect that the defendants’ fuel surcharge practices relating to contract
and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of
antitrust laws.  The suits seek unquantified treble damages (three
times the amount of actual damages) allegedly sustained by purported class
members, attorneys’ fees and other relief. All but three of the lawsuits
purport to be filed on behalf of a class of shippers that allegedly purchased
rail freight transportation services from the defendants through the use of
contracts or through other means exempt from rate regulation during defined
periods commencing as early as June 2003 and that were assessed fuel
surcharges.  Three of the lawsuits purport to be on behalf of indirect
purchasers of rail services.

In July
2007, CSXT received a grand jury subpoena from the New Jersey Office of the
Attorney General seeking information related to the same fuel surcharges that
are the subject of the purported class actions.  It is possible that
additional federal or state agencies could initiate investigations into similar
matters.

CSXT
believes that its fuel surcharge practices are lawful.  Accordingly,
CSXT intends to vigorously defend itself against the purported class actions,
which it believes are without merit.  CSXT cannot predict the outcome
of the putative class action lawsuits, which are in their preliminary stages, or
of any government investigations, charges or additional litigation that may be
filed in the future.  Penalties for violating antitrust laws can be
severe, involving both potential criminal and civil liability.  CSXT
is unable to assess at this time the possible financial impact of this
litigation.  CSXT has not accrued any liability for an adverse outcome
in the litigation.  If a material adverse outcome were to occur and be
sustained, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Other
Legal Proceedings

In addition to the matter described
above, the Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a
party to a number of legal actions and claims, various governmental proceedings
and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to
environmental matters, FELA claims by employees, other personal injury claims
and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and
charges.  Some of the legal proceedings include claims for
compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be,
class actions.  While the final outcome of these matters cannot be
predicted with certainty, considering among other things the meritorious legal
defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable
insurance, it is currently the opinion of CSX management that none of these
items will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity.  An unexpected adverse
resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity
in a particular quarter or fiscal year.

General

The
Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried,
management personnel.  The plans provide eligible employees with
retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation
rates near retirement.  For employees hired after December 31, 2002,

compensation.

addition to these plans, CSX sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life
insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management
employees hired on or before December 31, 2002 upon their retirement if certain
eligibility requirements are met.  The post-retirement medical plan is
contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted
annually.  The life insurance plan is
non-contributory.

(a)
      For pension plans, the other category consists of terminated but vested
      former employees.  For post-retirement plans, the other category
      consists of employees on long-term disability that have not yet
      retired.

As
currently permitted by SFAS 87,

Employers Accounting for
Pensions

, the Company has elected to use a plan measurement date of
September 30 to actuarially value its pension and post-retirement
plans.  Effective fiscal year 2008, under the provisions of SFAS 158,
CSX will be required to change the measurement date for pension and
post-retirement benefit plans from September 30 to the last day of the Company’s
fiscal year.

The
Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of
liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that
the Company selects.

The
benefit obligation for these plans represents the liability of the Company for
current and retired employees and is affected primarily by the
following:

·

service
      cost (benefits attributed to employee service during the
      period);

·

interest
      cost (interest on the liability due to the passage of
    time);

·

actuarial
      gains/losses (experience during the year different from that assumed and
      changes in plan assumptions); and

·

benefits
      paid to participants.

Cash
Flows

Plan
assets are amounts that have been segregated and restricted to provide benefits
and include amounts contributed by the Company and amounts earned from invested
contributions, net of benefits paid. The Company funds the cost of the
post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits on a pay-as-you go basis.
CSX does not expect to make cash contributions to its qualified defined benefit
pension plans in 2008.

Plan
Assets

The CSX
Investment Committee (“the Investment Committee”), whose members were selected
by the CFO and approved by the CEO, is responsible for managing pension plan
assets.  The Investment Committee utilizes an asset allocation
strategy that was developed using asset return simulation in conjunction with
projected plan liabilities.  The allocation seeks maximization of
returns within the constraints of acceptable risks considering the long-term
investment horizon.  A target allocation of 60% equity and 40% fixed
income investments was established.

The
distribution of pension plan assets as of the measurement date is as
follows:

The
Investment Committee provides investment guidelines to both the plan’s fixed
income and equity fund managers.  Within the broad asset classes that
comprise the plan’s investments, common stocks were diversified based on
allocations to domestic and foreign stocks.  Allocations were
maintained within 3% of targets.  The U.S. stock segment includes
style diversification among managers of large and small capitalization
stocks.  The Investment Committee limits investment by industry
sectors, outlines individual stock issuer concentration and monitors the use of
derivatives and CSX securities.

Fixed
income securities were diversified across fund managers with differing
investment styles and were benchmarked to a long duration index.  The
Investment Committee specifies the types of allowable investments, such as
government, corporate and asset-backed bonds, and limits diversification between
domestic and foreign investments and the use of
derivatives.  Additionally, it stipulates minimum credit quality
constraints and any prohibited securities.

Individual
investments or fund managers were selected in accordance with standards of
prudence applicable to asset diversification and investment
suitability.  Fund investment performance is continuously
monitored.  Acceptable performance is determined in the context of the
long-term return objectives of the fund and appropriate asset class
benchmarks.

The net

assumptions for the health care cost trend rate for medical plans. The rate is
assumed to gradually decrease to 4.75% by 2014. Additionally, there are cost
differentials between Medicare and Non-Medicare eligible individuals which are
reflected below.

For every
1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate, service and interest cost
will change $1 million (consolidated income statement impact). For every 1%
increase in the health care cost trend rate the Company’s benefit obligation
will increase by $15 million, and for every 1% decrease the Company’s benefit
obligation will decrease by $13 million (consolidated balance sheet
impact).  An increase in rates has a greater effect on the Company’s
benefit obligation due to the impact of compounding on future
years.

Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

As
required by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003 (the “Act”), CSX has determined that its medical plan’s prescription drug
benefit qualifies as actuarially equivalent to the benefit that would be paid
under the Act.  CSX has received $4 million in tax free federal
reimbursement for prescription drug claims in both 2007 and 2006.

Other
Plans

Under
collective bargaining agreements, the Company participates in a multi-employer
benefit plan, which provides certain post-retirement health care and life
insurance benefits to eligible contract employees. Premiums under this plan are
expensed as incurred and amounted to $31 million, $30 million and $30 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The
Company maintains savings plans for virtually all full-time salaried employees
and certain employees covered by collective bargaining
agreements.  Expense associated with these plans was $24 million, $18
million and $19 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  The
increase in 2007 is primarily driven by new labor agreements that increased the
Company’s 401(k) match for certain plans.

Convertible
Debentures

In
October 2001, CSX issued $564 million aggregate principal amount at maturity in
unsubordinated zero coupon convertible debentures (the "debentures") due October
30, 2021 for an initial offering price of approximately $462
million.  The carrying value of outstanding debentures was $174
million and $473 million, at December 2007 and December 2006,
respectively.  From their date of issuance, these debentures had
accreted (increased) in value at a yield to maturity of 1% per
year.  On October 30, 2007, the accretion rate was reset to
2.1%.  The accretion rate may be reset again in October 2011 and
October 2016 to a rate based on five-year United States Treasury Notes minus
2.8%.  In no event, however, will the yield to maturity be reset below
1% or above 3% per annum.  Accretion in value on the debentures is
recorded for each period, but will not be paid prior to maturity.

The
debentures allow holders to require CSX to purchase their debentures in October
2008, October 2011 and October 2016, at a purchase price equal to the accreted
value of the debentures at the time.  CSX may redeem the debentures
for cash at any time on or after October 30, 2008, at a redemption price equal
to the accreted value of the debentures.  Therefore, at December 2007,
the debentures were classified in current maturities of long-term debt in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Holders
currently may convert their debentures into shares of CSX common stock at a
conversion rate of 35.49 common shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity
of debentures.  During 2007, $375 million face value of debentures
were converted into 13 million shares of CSX common stock.  No
material conversions occurred during 2006.  At December 2007, $174
million face value debentures remained outstanding convertible into 6 million
shares.

Credit
Facilities

In 2006,
the Company entered into a $1.25 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit
facility and a $15 million secured revolving credit facility expiring in
2011.  In 2007, with the consent of the lenders and in accordance with
the facility’s terms, CSX extended the maturity date of the $1.25 billion
facility an additional year, to 2012.  CSX also has an $18.5 million
364-day unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in August
2008.

Additionally,
with the approval of the lending banks, CSX may increase its total borrowing
capacity under the $1.25 billion facility by $500 million, from $1.25 billion to
up to $1.75 billion.

The facility was not
drawn on as of December 2007.  Commitment fees and interest rates
payable under the facility were similar to fees and rates available to
comparably rated investment-grade borrowers.

In 2007,
CSX paid approximately $2 million in total fees associated with the undrawn
facilities. These credit facilities allow for borrowings at floating
(LIBOR-based) interest rates, plus a spread, depending upon CSX’s senior
unsecured debt ratings. LIBOR is the London Interbank Offered Rate which is a
daily reference rate based on the interest rates at which banks offer to lend
unsecured funds. At December 2007, CSX was in compliance with all covenant
requirements under the facilities.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

Fair
values of CSX’s financial instruments were estimated by reference to quoted
prices from market sources and financial institutions as well as other valuation
techniques. Long-term debt is the only financial instrument of CSX with fair
values significantly different from their carrying amounts.  The fair
value of long-term debt has been estimated using discounted cash flow analysis
based upon CSX's current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
financing arrangements.

      Other items primarily include tax impacts from equity in Conrail and other

The change in the 2007 effective income
tax rate compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to prior year audit
resolutions favorably impacting the 2006 effective rate. The net state income
tax impact of the 2006 resolutions of federal income tax audits of $15 million
is included on the 2006 state income taxes line above.  The state
income tax benefit in 2005 is largely due to the recognition of an income tax
benefit of $71 million for the Ohio legislative change to gradually eliminate
its corporate franchise tax.

NOTE
13.  Income Taxes, continued

CSX
adopted FIN 48, at the beginning of fiscal year 2007. As a result of the
implementation, the Company recognized a $31 million decrease to reserves for
uncertain tax positions.  This decrease, along with a $2 million
reduction for unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method
of accounting, was recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning
balance of retained earnings on the balance sheet.

The
change to the total gross unrecognized tax benefits of the Company during the
fiscal year ended December 28, 2007 is reconciled as follows:

$    

Of the
total gross reserve for uncertain tax positions listed above, $197 million (of
the beginning balance) and $50 million (of the ending balance) net of federal
benefit on state issues could favorably affect the effective tax
rate.  The annual decrease in unrecognized tax benefits primarily
related to settlements with the IRS that resulted in a $110 million discontinued
operations benefit (See Note 17, Discontinued Operations).  The
Company estimates that approximately $17 million of the unrecognized tax
benefits as of December 2007 for various state and federal income tax matters
will be resolved over the next 12 months.  The final outcome of these
uncertain tax positions, however, is not yet determinable.

The
Company files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its
principal domestic subsidiaries. CSX and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S.
federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state
jurisdictions.  The Company has substantially concluded all U.S.
federal income tax examinations for years through 2003 and substantially all
other income tax matters have been concluded for years through
1998.   Federal income tax returns for 2004 through 2006 are
currently under examination.

CSX’s
continuing practice is to recognize net interest and penalties related to income
tax matters in income tax expense.  Included in the consolidated
income statements are $(8) million, $(79) million, and $43 million for fiscal
years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, of interest and penalties
expense/(benefit) for all prior year tax positions.  Benefits for
interest and penalties are due to favorable tax settlements of prior period tax
audits where the Company had previously accrued a liability for interest and
penalties.  The Company had $4 million and $52 million accrued for
interest and penalties for 2007 and 2006 respectively, for all prior year tax
positions.  The decrease for interest and penalties during both 2007
and 2006 is primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax audits and
payments made to the IRS by the Company.

NOTE
14.  Derivative Financial Instruments

CSX uses
derivative financial instruments to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations
in interest rates and has previously used such instruments to manage exposure to
fluctuations in fuel costs.

Interest
Rate Swaps

During
2007, CSX repaid $450 million of debentures that matured and called $150 million
of debentures due in 2032 (See Note 9, Debt and Credit
Agreements).  As a result, CSX also settled the interest rate swaps
related to these debentures.  CSX had $35 million and $640 million of
outstanding interest rate swaps that impacted interest expense by $2 million for
2007 and 2006.  The interest rate swap agreements were designated and
qualified as fair value hedges, and the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the fixed rate note
attributed to the hedged risk, were recognized in current earnings during the
period of change in fair values.  CSX’s interest rate swaps qualified
as perfectly effective fair value hedges, as defined by SFAS 133. As such, there
was no ineffective portion to the hedge recognized in earnings during the
current or prior year periods.

Fuel
Hedging

In 2003,
CSX began a program to hedge a portion of CSXT’s future locomotive fuel
purchases. This program was established to manage exposure to fuel price
fluctuations. To minimize this risk, CSX entered into a series of
swaps.  Ineffectiveness, or the extent to which changes in the fair
values of the fuel swaps did not offset changes in the fair values of the
expected fuel purchases, was immaterial.  CSX suspended entering into
new swaps in its fuel hedge program in 2004 and there are currently no
outstanding contracts.

Fuel hedging activity offset increased
fuel expense for the fiscal years 2006 and 2005 by $55 million and $249 million,
respectively.  Since the end of third quarter 2006, there has been no
impact on fuel expense as all contracts expired prior to that time.

NOTE
15.  Business Segments

The
Company operates primarily in two business segments: rail and
intermodal.  The rail segment provides rail freight transportation
over a network of approximately 21,000 route miles in 23 states, the District of
Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The intermodal
segment provides integrated rail and truck transportation services and operates
a network of dedicated intermodal facilities across North
America.  These segments are strategic business units that offer
different services and are managed separately.  Performance is
evaluated and resources are allocated based on several factors, of which the
principal financial measures are business segment operating income and operating
ratio.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting
Policies.

16.  Related Party Transactions

Through a limited liability company,
CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation (“NS”) jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42%
economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity and NS has
the remainder of the economic and voting interests.  Pursuant to the
Accounting Principle Board (“APB”) Opinion 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock,

CSX applies the equity method of accounting
to its investment in Conrail.

Conrail
owns and operates rail infrastructure for the joint benefit of CSX and
NS.  This is known as the shared asset area (“shared asset area”).
Conrail charges fees for right-of way usage, equipment rentals and
transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset
area.   Historically, these expenses were included as an expense
category, Conrail rents, fees and services, in the consolidated income
statements.  Beginning in 2007, these amounts have been included in
materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income
statements.

Also
included in materials, supplies and other are CSX’s 42% share of Conrail’s
income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the
acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments.  The
amortization primarily represents the additional after tax depreciation expense
related to the write-up of Conrail’s fixed assets when the original purchase
price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair
value.

the Company has identified below amounts owed to
Conrail, or its affiliates, representing liabilities under the operating,
equipment and shared area agreements with Conrail.  The Company also
executed two promissory notes with a subsidiary of Conrail which were included

NOTE
17.  Discontinued Operations

In 2005, CSX sold its International
Terminals business, which included the capital stock of SL Services, Inc.
(“SLSI”) to Dubai Ports International FZE (“DPI”) for gross cash consideration
of $1.142 billion. Of the gross proceeds, approximately $110 million was paid
for the purchase of a minority interest in an International Terminals’
subsidiary, which the Company acquired during the first quarter of 2005 and
divested as part of the sale to DPI.  Other related cash transaction costs
amounted to approximately $34 million, including resolution of working capital
and long-term debt adjustments.

CSX recognized a gain of $683 million
pre-tax, $428 million after tax, in fiscal year 2005 as a result of the
sale.  Consequently, amounts related to this gain and the business
were reported as discontinued operations on the Consolidated Income
Statement.

SLSI also
holds certain residual assets and liabilities as a result of prior divestitures
and discontinuances.  A wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX retains the
rights to those assets and indemnifies DPI, SLSI and related entities against
those liabilities pursuant to a separate agreement.  CSX guarantees
the obligations of its subsidiary under this separate agreement.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of
December 28, 2007, under the supervision and with the participation of CSX's
Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), management
has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO
concluded that, as of December 28, 2007, the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level in timely alerting
them to material information required to be included in CSX’s periodic SEC
reports. There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting during the fourth quarter of 2007 that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

Management's
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

CSX’s
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the
management of CSX, including CSX’s CEO and CFO, CSX conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 28, 2007 based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission which is also referred to as COSO. Based on that evaluation,
management of CSX concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 28, 2007.  Management's
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is
expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be
met.

The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2007 has
been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included elsewhere
herein.

Commission (the COSO criteria). CSX Corporation’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Oversight Board (United States), the 2007 consolidated financial statements of
CSX Corporation and our report dated February 15, 2008 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
