    express an expectation or belief as to future results or events,
    such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and
    expectations of our management and expressed in good faith and
    believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no
    assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be
    achieved or accomplished. The following include some but not all
    of the factors that could cause actual results or events to
    differ materially from those anticipated:

•

our ability to migrate our production and manufacturing
    operations to lower-cost locations around the world;

    the manufacture of our products;

•

the impact of increases in prices of other materials used in our
    products, such as dyes and chemicals, and increases in other
    costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs;

•

costs and adverse publicity arising from violations of labor or
    environmental laws by us or any of our third-party manufacturers;

•

our ability to attract and retain key personnel;

•

our debt and debt service requirements that restrict our
    operating and financial flexibility, and impose interest and
    financing costs;

•

the risk of inflation or deflation;

•

consumer disposable income and spending levels, including the
    availability and amount of individual consumer debt;

•

retailer consolidation and other changes in the apparel
    essentials industry;

There may be other factors that may cause our actual results to
    differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our
    actual results, performance or achievements could differ
    materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the
    forward-looking statements. We can give no assurances that any
    of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will
    occur or, if any of them does, what impact they will have on our
    results of operations and financial condition. You should

    things, cause our actual results to differ from these
    forward-looking statements.

    statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking
    statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances
    that arise after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of
    unanticipated events, other than as required by law.

PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

We are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading
    apparel brands, including

Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Bali,
    Just My Size, barely there

and

Wonderbra.

We design,
    manufacture, source and sell a broad range of apparel essentials
    such as t-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear,
    kids’ underwear, socks, hosiery, casualwear and activewear.

Our products are sold through multiple distribution channels.
    During the year ended December 29, 2007, approximately 46%
    of our net sales were to mass merchants, 19% were to national
    chains and department stores, 8% were direct to consumers, 9%
    were in our International segment and 18% were to other retail
    channels such as embellishers, specialty retailers, warehouse
    clubs and sporting goods stores. In addition to designing and
    marketing apparel essentials, we have a long history of
    operating a global supply chain that incorporates a mix of
    self-manufacturing, third-party contractors and third-party
    sourcing.

The apparel essentials segment of the apparel industry is
    characterized by frequently replenished items, such as t-shirts,
    bras, panties, men’s underwear, kids’ underwear, socks
    and hosiery. Growth and sales in the apparel essentials industry
    are not primarily driven by fashion, in contrast to other areas
    of the broader apparel industry. Rather, we focus on the core
    attributes of comfort, fit and value, while remaining current
    with regard to consumer trends. The majority of our core styles
    continue from year to year, with variations only in color,
    fabric or design details. We continue to invest in our largest
    and strongest brands to achieve our long-term growth goals.

Our operations are managed and reported in five operating
    segments: Innerwear, Outerwear, Hosiery, International and
    Other. The following table summarizes our operating segments by
    category:

**

As a result of the February 2006 sale of the European branded
    apparel business of Sara Lee Corporation, or “Sara
    Lee,” we are not permitted to sell this brand in the member
    states of the European Union, or the “EU,” several
    other European countries and South Africa.

Our brands have a strong heritage in the apparel essentials
    industry. According to The NPD Group/Consumer Tracking Service,
    or “NPD,” our brands hold either the number one or
    number two U.S. market position by sales in most product
    categories in which we compete, on a rolling year-end basis as
    of December 31, 2007. According to a 2007 survey of
    consumer brand awareness by Women’s Wear Daily,

Hanes

is the most recognized apparel and accessory brand among
    women in the United States. According to



Millward Brown Market Research,

Hanes

is found in over
    85% of the United States households that have purchased
    men’s or women’s casual clothing or underwear in the

12-month

period ended December 31, 2007.

According to NPD, we are the largest seller of apparel
    essentials in the United States as measured by sales on a
    rolling year-end basis as of December 31, 2007. We sell our
    products primarily through large, high-volume retailers,
    including mass merchants, department stores and national chains.
    We have met the demands of our customers by developing
    vertically integrated operations and an extensive network of
    owned facilities and third-party manufacturers over a broad
    geographic footprint. We have strong, long-term relationships
    with our top customers, including relationships of more than ten
    years with each of our top ten customers. The size and
    operational scale of the high-volume retailers with which we do
    business require extensive category and product knowledge and
    specialized services regarding the quantity, quality and
    planning of orders. We align significant parts of our
    organization with corresponding parts of our customers,
    organizing into teams that sell to and service our customers
    across a range of functional areas, such as demand planning,
    replenishment and logistics. We also have customer-specific
    programs such as the

C9 by Champion

products marketed and
    sold through Target stores.

Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry
    trends will continue to be key to our success. Our design,
    research and product development teams, in partnership with our
    marketing teams, drive our efforts to bring innovations to
    market. We intend to leverage our insights into consumer demand
    in the apparel essentials industry to develop new products
    within our existing lines and to modify our existing core
    products in ways that make them more appealing, addressing
    changing customer needs and industry trends. Examples of our
    recent innovations include:

•

Hanes All-Over Comfort Bra

, which features stay-put
    straps that don’t slip, cushioned wires that don’t
    poke and a tag-free back (2006).

•

Hanes Comfort Soft

T-shirt (2007).

•

Bali Passion for Comfort

bra, designed to be the ultimate
    comfort bra, features a silky smooth lining for a luxurious feel
    against the body (2007).

•

Bali Concealers

bras, the first and only bra with
    revolutionary concealing petals for complete modesty (2008).

•

Hanes

no ride up panties (2008).

We were spun off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006. In
    connection with the spin off, Sara Lee contributed its branded
    apparel Americas and Asia business to us and distributed all of
    the outstanding shares of our common stock to its stockholders
    on a pro rata basis. As a result of the spin off, Sara Lee
    ceased to own any equity interest in our company. In this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K,

we describe the businesses contributed to us by Sara Lee in the
    spin off as if the contributed businesses were our business for
    all historical periods described. References in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

to our assets, liabilities, products, businesses or activities
    of our business for periods including or prior to the spin off
    are generally intended to refer to the historical assets,
    liabilities, products, businesses or activities of the
    contributed businesses as the businesses were conducted as part
    of Sara Lee and its subsidiaries prior to the spin off. Our
    fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and
    previously ended on the Saturday closest to June 30. We
    refer to the fiscal year ended December 29, 2007 as the
    year ended December 29, 2007. A reference to a year ended
    on another date is to the fiscal year ended on that date.

We expect to continue the restructuring efforts that we have
    undertaken since the spin off from Sara Lee. For example, during
    the year ended December 29, 2007, in furtherance of our
    efforts to execute our consolidation and globalization strategy,
    we approved actions to close 17 manufacturing facilities and
    three distribution centers. The implementation of these efforts,
    which are designed to improve operating efficiencies and lower
    costs, has resulted and is likely to continue to result in
    significant costs and savings. As further plans are developed
    and approved by management and in some cases our board of
    directors, we expect to recognize additional restructuring costs
    to eliminate duplicative functions within the organization and
    transition a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity
    to lower-cost locations. As a result of these efforts, we



expect to incur approximately $250 million in restructuring
    and related charges over the three year period following the
    spin off from Sara Lee, approximately half of which is expected
    to be noncash. As of December 29, 2007, we have recognized
    approximately $116 million in restructuring and related
    charges related to these efforts.

Our
    Industry

The overall U.S. apparel market and the core categories
    critical to our future success will continue to be influenced by
    a number of broad-based trends:

•

the U.S. population is predicted to increase at a rate of
    less than 1% annually, with the rate of increase declining
    through 2050, with a continued aging of the population and a
    shift in the ethnic mix;

•

changing attitudes about fashion, the need for versatility, and
    continuing preferences for more casual apparel are expected to
    support the strength of basic or classic styles of “relaxed
    apparel;”

•

the impact of a continued deflationary environment in our
    business and the apparel essentials industry;

•

continued increases in body size across all age groups and
    genders, and especially among children, will drive demand for
    plus-sized apparel; and

•

intense competition in the retail industry, the shifting of
    formats among major retailers, convenience and value will
    continue to be key drivers.

In addition, we anticipate growth in the apparel essentials
    industry will be driven in part by product improvements and
    innovations. Improvements in product features, such as stretch
    in t-shirts or tagless garment labels, or in increased variety
    through new sizes or styles, are expected to enhance consumer
    appeal and category demand. Often the innovations and
    improvements in our industry are not trend-driven, but are
    designed to react to identifiable consumer needs and demands. As
    a consequence, the apparel essentials market is characterized by
    lower fashion risks compared to other apparel categories.

Our
    Brands

Our portfolio of leading brands is designed to address the needs
    and wants of various consumer segments across a broad range of
    apparel essentials products. Each of our brands has a particular
    consumer positioning that distinguishes it from its competitors
    and guides its advertising and product development. We discuss
    some of our most important brands in more detail below.

Hanes

is the largest and most widely recognized brand in
    our portfolio. According to a 2007 survey of consumer brand
    awareness by Women’s Wear Daily,

Hanes

is the most
    recognized apparel and accessory brand among women in the United
    States. The

Hanes

brand covers all of our product
    categories, including men’s underwear, kids’
    underwear, bras, panties, socks, t-shirts, fleece and sheer
    hosiery.

Hanes

stands for outstanding comfort, style and
    value. According to Millward Brown Market Research,

Hanes

is found in over 85% of the United States households that
    have purchased men’s or women’s casual clothing or
    underwear in the

12-month

period ended December 31, 2007.

Champion

is our second-largest
    brand.  Specializing in athletic and other performance
    apparel, the

Champion

brand is designed for everyday
    athletes. We believe that

Champion

’s combination of
    comfort, fit and style provides athletes with mobility,
    durability and up-to-date styles, all product qualities that are
    important in the sale of athletic products. We also distribute
    products under the

C9 by Champion

brand exclusively
    through Target stores.

Playtex

, the third-largest brand within our portfolio,
    offers a line of bras, panties and shapewear, including products
    that offer solutions for hard to fit figures.

Bali

is the
    fourth-largest brand within our portfolio.

Bali

offers a
    range of bras, panties and shapewear sold in the department
    store channel. Our brand portfolio also includes the following
    well-known brands:

L’eggs

,

Just My Size

,

barely there

,

Wonderbra

,

Outer Banks

and

Duofold.

These brands serve to round out our product
    offerings, allowing us to give consumers a variety of options to
    meet their diverse needs.



Our
    Segments

Our operations are managed in five operating segments, each of
    which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes:
    Innerwear, Outerwear, Hosiery, International and Other. These
    segments are organized principally by product category and
    geographic location. For more information about our segments,
    see Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Innerwear

The Innerwear segment focuses on core apparel essentials, and
    consists of products such as women’s intimate apparel,
    men’s underwear, kids’ underwear, socks, thermals and
    sleepwear, marketed under well-known brands that are trusted by
    consumers. We are an intimate apparel category leader in the
    United States with our

Hanes

,

Playtex

,

Bali

,

Just My Size, barely there

and

Wonderbra

brands. We are also a leading manufacturer and
    marketer of men’s underwear and kids’ underwear under
    the

Hanes

and

Champion

brand names. We also
    produce underwear products under a licensing agreement with Polo
    Ralph Lauren. Our net sales for the year ended December 29,
    2007 from our Innerwear segment were $2.6 billion,
    representing approximately 57% of total segment net sales.

Outerwear

We are a leader in the casualwear and activewear markets through
    our

Hanes

,

Champion

and

Just My Size

brands, where we offer products such as t-shirts and fleece.
    Our casualwear lines offer a range of quality, comfortable
    clothing for men, women and children marketed under the

Hanes

and

Just My Size

brands. The

Just My Size

brand offers casual apparel designed exclusively to meet the
    needs of plus-size women. In addition to activewear for men and
    women,

Champion

provides uniforms for athletic programs
    and includes an apparel program,

C9 by Champion,

at
    Target stores. We also license our

Champion

name for
    collegiate apparel and footwear. We also supply our t-shirts,
    sportshirts and fleece products primarily to wholesalers, who
    then resell to screen printers and embellishers through brands
    such as

Hanes, Champion,

and

Outer Banks

. These
    products are sold primarily under the

Hanes

,

Hanes
    Beefy-T

and

Outer Banks

brands. Our net sales for the
    year ended December 29, 2007 from our Outerwear segment
    were $1.2 billion, representing approximately 27% of total
    segment net sales.

Hosiery

We are the leading marketer of women’s sheer hosiery in the
    United States. We compete in the hosiery market by striving to
    offer superior values and executing integrated marketing
    activities, as well as focusing on the style of our hosiery
    products. We market hosiery products under our

Hanes

,

L’eggs

and

Just My Size

brands. Our net sales
    for the year ended December 29, 2007 from our Hosiery
    segment were $266 million, representing approximately 6% of
    total segment net sales. We expect the trend of declining
    hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in
    the industry (although the decline has slowed in recent years)
    and with shifts in consumer preferences.

International

International includes products that span across the Innerwear,
    Outerwear and Hosiery reportable segments and include products
    marketed under the

Hanes

,

Champion

,

Wonderbra

,

Playtex

,

Rinbros

,

Bali

and

Stedman

brands. Our net sales in this segment
    included sales in Latin America, Asia, Canada and Europe. Japan,
    Canada and Mexico are our largest international markets, and we
    also have sales offices in India and China. Our net sales for
    the year ended December 29, 2007 from our International
    segment were $422 million, representing approximately 9% of
    total segment net sales.

Other

Our net sales in this segment are comprised of sales of
    nonfinished products such as fabric and certain other materials
    in the United States and Latin America in order to maintain
    asset utilization at certain



manufacturing facilities. Our net sales for the year ended
    December 29, 2007 from our Other segment were
    $57 million, representing approximately 1% of total segment
    net sales.

Design,
    Research and Product Development

At the core of our design, research and product development
    capabilities is a team of more than 300 professionals. We have
    combined our design, research and development teams into an
    integrated group for all of our product categories. A facility
    located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is the center of our
    research, technical design and product development efforts. We
    also employ creative design and product development personnel in
    our design center in New York City. During the year ended
    December 29, 2007, the six months ended December 30,
    2006 the year ended July 1, 2006 and the year ended
    July 2, 2005, we spent approximately $45 million,
    $23 million, $55 million and $51 million,
    respectively, on design, research and product development.

Customers

In the year ended December 29, 2007, approximately 90% of
    our net sales were to customers in the United States and
    approximately 10% were to customers outside the United States.
    Domestically, almost 85% of our net sales were wholesale sales
    to retailers, 7% were wholesale sales to third-party
    embellishers and 8% were direct to consumers. We have
    well-established relationships with some of the largest apparel
    retailers in the world. Our largest customers are Wal-Mart
    Stores, Inc., or “Wal-Mart,” Target Corporation, or
    “Target” and Kohl’s Corporation, or
    “Kohl’s,” accounting for 27%, 14% and 6%,
    respectively, of our total sales in the year ended
    December 29, 2007. As is common in the apparel essentials
    industry, we generally do not have purchase agreements that
    obligate our customers, including Wal-Mart, to purchase our
    products. However, all of our key customer relationships have
    been in place for ten years or more. Wal-Mart and Target are our
    only customers with sales that exceed 10% of any individual
    segment’s sales. In our Innerwear segment, Wal-Mart
    accounted for 30% of sales and Target accounted for 11% of sales
    during the year ended December 29, 2007. In our Outerwear
    segment, Wal-Mart accounted for 24% of sales and Target
    accounted for 25% of sales during the year ended
    December 29, 2007.

Due to their size and operational scale, high-volume retailers
    such as Wal-Mart require extensive category and product
    knowledge and specialized services regarding the quantity,
    quality and timing of product orders. We have organized
    multifunctional customer management teams, which has allowed us
    to form strategic long-term relationships with these customers
    and efficiently focus resources on category, product and service
    expertise.

Smaller regional customers attracted to our leading brands and
    quality products also represent an important component of our
    distribution. Our organizational model provides for an efficient
    use of resources that delivers a high level of category and
    channel expertise and services to these customers.

Sales to the mass merchant channel accounted for approximately
    46% of our net sales in the year ended December 29, 2007.
    We sell all of our product categories in this channel primarily
    under our

Hanes

,

Just My Size

,

Playtex

and

C9 by Champion

brands. Mass merchants feature
    high-volume, low-cost sales of basic apparel items along with a
    diverse variety of consumer goods products, such as grocery and
    drug products and other hard lines, and are characterized by
    large retailers, such as Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, which accounted for
    approximately 27% of our net sales during the year ended
    December 29, 2007, is our largest mass merchant customer.

Sales to the national chains and department stores channel
    accounted for approximately 19% of our net sales during the year
    ended December 29, 2007. These retailers target a
    higher-income consumer than mass merchants, focus more of their
    sales on apparel items rather than other consumer goods such as
    grocery and drug products, and are characterized by large
    retailers such as Kohl’s, JC Penney Company, Inc. and Sears
    Holdings Corporation. We sell all of our product categories in
    this channel. Traditional department stores target higher-income
    consumers and carry more high-end, fashion conscious products
    than national chains or mass merchants and tend to operate in
    higher-income areas and commercial centers. Traditional
    department



stores are characterized by large retailers such as Macy’s
    and Dillard’s, Inc. We sell products in our intimate
    apparel, hosiery and underwear categories through these
    department stores.

Sales to the direct to consumer channel accounted for
    approximately 8% of our net sales in the year ended
    December 29, 2007. We sell our branded products directly to
    consumers through our approximately 216 outlet stores, as well
    as our catalogs and our web sites operating under the

Hanes

,

OneHanesPlace

,

Outer Banks

,

Just
    My Size

and

Champion

names. Our outlet stores are
    value-based, offering the consumer a savings of 25% to 40% off
    suggested retail prices, and sell first-quality, excess,
    post-season, obsolete and slightly imperfect products. Our
    catalogs and web sites address the growing direct to consumer
    channel that operates in today’s 24/7 retail environment,
    and we have an active database of approximately three million
    consumers receiving our catalogs and emails. Our web sites have
    experienced significant growth and we expect this trend to
    continue as more consumers embrace this retail shopping channel.

Sales in our International segment represented approximately 9%
    of our net sales during the year ended December 29, 2007,
    and included sales in Latin America, Asia, Canada and Europe.
    Japan, Canada and Mexico are our largest international markets,
    and we also have sales offices in India and China. We operate in
    several locations in Latin America including Mexico, Puerto
    Rico, Argentina, Brazil and Central America. From an export
    business perspective, we use distributors to service customers
    in the Middle East and Asia, and have a limited presence in
    Latin America. The brands that are the primary focus of the
    export business include

Hanes

underwear and

Bali

,

Playtex

,

Wonderbra

and

barely there

intimate apparel. As discussed below, we are not permitted
    to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded products in
    the member states of the EU, several other European countries,
    and South Africa.

Sales in other channels represented approximately 18% of our net
    sales during the year ended December 29, 2007. We sell
    t-shirts, golf and sport shirts and fleece sweatshirts to
    third-party embellishers primarily under our

Hanes

,

Hanes Beefy-T

and

Outer Banks

brands. Sales to
    third-party embellishers accounted for approximately 7% of our
    net sales during the year ended December 29, 2007. We also
    sell a significant range of our underwear, activewear and sock
    products under the

Champion

brand to wholesale clubs,
    such as Costco, and sporting goods stores, such as The Sports
    Authority, Inc. We sell primarily legwear and underwear products
    under the

Hanes

and

L’eggs

brands to food,
    drug and variety stores. We sell our branded apparel essentials
    products to the U.S. military for sale to servicemen and
    servicewomen.

Inventory

Effective inventory management is a key component of our future
    success. Because our customers do not purchase our products
    under long-term supply contracts, but rather on a purchase order
    basis, effective inventory management requires close
    coordination with the customer base. We employ various types of
    inventory management techniques that include collaborative
    forecasting and planning, vendor-managed inventory, key event
    management and various forms of replenishment management
    processes. We have demand management planners in our customer
    management group who work closely with customers to develop
    demand forecasts that are passed to the supply chain. We also
    have professionals within the customer management group who
    coordinate daily with our larger customers to help ensure that
    our customers’ planned inventory levels are in fact
    available at their individual retail outlets. Additionally,
    within our supply chain organization we have dedicated
    professionals that translate the demand forecast into our
    inventory strategy and specific production plans. These
    individuals work closely with our customer management team to
    balance inventory investment/exposure with customer service
    targets.

Seasonality
    and Other Factors

Our operating results are subject to some variability.
    Generally, our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate
    the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items.
    Sales are typically higher in the last two quarters (July to
    December) of each fiscal year. Socks, hosiery and fleece
    products generally have higher sales during this period as a
    result of cooler weather, back-to-school shopping and holidays.
    Sales levels in a period are also impacted by customers’
    decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in
    response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may
    cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the



mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us. Our results
    of operations are also impacted by fluctuations and volatility
    in the price of cotton and the timing of actual spending for our
    media, advertising and promotion expenses. Media, advertising
    and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a
    year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for
    retail selling seasons and product introductions. Our costs for
    cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles vary based upon the
    fluctuating cost of cotton, which is affected by weather,
    consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the
    relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of
    producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are
    generally unpredictable and beyond our control. While we do
    enter into short-term supply agreements and hedges in an attempt
    to protect our business from the volatility of the market price
    of cotton, our business can be affected by dramatic movements in
    cotton prices.

Marketing

Our strategy is to bring consumer-driven innovation to market in
    a compelling way. Our approach is to build targeted, effective
    multimedia advertising and marketing campaigns to increase
    awareness of our key brands. Driving growth platforms across
    categories is a major element of our strategy as it enables us
    to meet key consumer needs and leverage advertising dollars. We
    believe that the strength of our consumer insights, our
    distinctive brand propositions and our focus on integrated
    marketing give us a competitive advantage in the fragmented
    apparel marketplace.

In 2007, we launched a number of new advertising and marketing
    initiatives:

•

We featured Jennifer Love Hewitt in a new television, print and
    online advertising campaign that began in March 2007 in support
    of the launch of the

Hanes All-Over Comfort Bra with
    ComfortSoft

straps. The campaign includes new television,
    print and online ads.

•

We launched our latest “Look Who” advertising campaign
    featuring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Michael Jordan in July 2007, in
    support of the new

Hanes ComfortSoft

Collection for Men,
    which includes the

Hanes ComfortSoft

undershirt and

ComfortSoft

underwear.

•

Also in July 2007, we launched The

Hanes ComfortZone

Tour, a mobile marketing initiative focused on making men
    comfortable using a mixture of interactive elements to expose
    them to the

Hanes ComfortSoft

undershirts and underwear.
    The tour featured a team of brand ambassadors using an array of
    interactive games and giveaways to help men experience

ComfortSoft

product innovation first hand.

•

In November 2007, we launched the first campaign for our

Champion

brand since 2003, a national advertising
    campaign featuring a new tagline, “How You Play.” The
    campaign which includes print, out-of-home and online
    components, is designed to capture the everyday moments of fun
    and sport in a series of cool and hip lifestyle images.

•

In the Spring of 2007, we launched a new “Live
    Beautifully” campaign for our

Bali

brand. The print,
    television and online ad campaign features Bali bras and panties
    from its

Passion for Comfort

,

Seductive Curve

and

Cotton Creations

lines.

•

We launched an innovative and expressive advertising and
    marketing campaign called “Girl Talk” in September
    2007 in which confident, everyday women talk about their
    breasts, in support of our

Playtex 18 Hour

and

Playtex
    Secrets

product lines.

In October 2007, we announced a

10-year

strategic alliance with The Walt Disney Company. Key features of
    the alliance include:

•

Hanes

will be the presenting sponsor of the Rock
    ‘n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, one of the most
    popular attractions at

Disney-MGM

Studios in Florida.

•

Hanes

will have a customizable apparel venue in Downtown
    Disney at Walt Disney World Resort that will enable guests to
    design and personalize their own custom T-shirts and other items.



•

Champion

will have naming rights for the stadium at
    Disney’s Wide World of Sports Complex, the nation’s
    premier amateur sports venue. In addition to

Champion

Stadium, there will be brand placement and promotional
    opportunities throughout the complex.

•

We will have in-store promotional and brand building
    opportunities at eight ESPN Zone restaurants and stores located
    across the country.

•

Hanes

and

Champion

will have category exclusivity
    for select apparel at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, Calif., Walt
    Disney World Resort and Disney’s Wide World of Sports
    Complex Stadium, both in Florida, and all eight ESPN Zone stores.

•

Our products, including T-shirts and tanks and fleece
    sweatshirts, sweatpants, hoodies and other family fleece,
    including infant and toddler items, will be co-labeled,
    including

Disneyland Resort by Hanes

,

    World by Hanes

,

Disney’s Wide World of Sports
    Complex by Champion

and

ESPN Zone by Champion.

Distribution

We distribute our products for the U.S. market primarily
    from

U.S.-based

company-owned and company-operated distribution centers. As of
    December 29, 2007, we distributed products for the U.S.
    market from 26 distribution centers, 19 of which were
    company-owned or company-operated. International distribution
    operations use a combination of third-party logistics providers,
    as well as owned and operated distribution operations, to
    distribute goods to our various international markets. We are
    currently in the process of consolidating several of our
    distribution centers, and have reduced the number of
    distribution centers from the 48 that we maintained at the time
    of the spin off to 41, of which 26 are company-owned or
    company-operated. In this process, we approved actions to close
    three distribution centers during the year ended
    December 29, 2007.

Manufacturing
    and Sourcing

During the year ended December 29, 2007, approximately 79%
    of our finished goods sold in the United States were
    manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and
    operate and facilities owned and operated by third-party
    contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing
    process for us, such as cutting

and/or

sewing. We sourced the remainder of our finished goods from
    third-party manufacturers who supply us with finished products
    based on our designs. We believe that our balanced approach to
    product supply, which relies on a combination of owned,
    contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different
    geographic regions, increases the efficiency of our operations,
    reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of
    supply.

Finished
    Goods That Are Manufactured by Hanesbrands

The manufacturing process for finished goods that we manufacture
    begins with raw materials we obtain from third parties. The
    principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and
    synthetics. Our costs for cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles
    vary based upon the fluctuating and often volatile cost of
    cotton, which is affected by, among other factors, weather,
    consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market and the
    relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of
    producer versus consumer countries. We attempt to mitigate the
    effect of fluctuating raw material costs by entering into
    short-term supply agreements that set the price we will pay for
    cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles in future periods. We also
    enter into hedging contracts on cotton designed to protect us
    from severe market fluctuations in the wholesale prices of
    cotton. In addition to cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles, we
    use thread and trim for product identification, buttons,
    zippers, snaps and lace.

Fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may also influence
    the prices of items used in our business, such as chemicals,
    dyestuffs, polyester yarn and foam. Alternate sources of these
    materials and services are readily available. After they are
    sourced, cotton and synthetic materials are spun into yarn,
    which is then knitted into cotton, synthetic and blended
    fabrics. We spin a significant portion of the yarn and knit a



significant portion of the fabrics we use in our owned and
    operated facilities. To a lesser extent, we purchase fabric from
    several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with
    scheduled production. These fabrics are cut and sewn into
    finished products, either by us or by third-party contractors.
    Most of our cutting and sewing operations are located in Central
    America and the Caribbean Basin.

Rising fuel, energy and utility costs may have a significant
    impact on our manufacturing costs. These costs may fluctuate due
    to a number of factors outside our control, including government
    policy and regulation and weather conditions.

We continue to consolidate our manufacturing facilities, and
    currently operate 62 manufacturing facilities, down from 70 at
    the time of our spin off. In making decisions about the location
    of manufacturing operations and third-party sources of supply,
    we consider a number of factors, including local labor costs,
    quality of production, applicable quotas and duties, and freight
    costs. Over the past ten years, we have engaged in a substantial
    asset relocation strategy designed to eliminate or relocate
    portions of our

U.S.-based

manufacturing operations to lower-cost locations in Central
    America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia. For example, during the
    third quarter of 2007, we acquired the 1,300-employee textile
    manufacturing operations in San Juan Opico, El Salvador of
    Industrias Duraflex, S.A. de C.V., at which textiles are knit,
    dyed, finished and cut. These operations had been a supplier to
    us since the early 1990s. This acquisition provides a textile
    base in Central America from which to expand and leverage our
    large scale as well as supply our sewing network throughout
    Central America. Also, we announced plans in October 2007 to
    build a textile production plant in Nanjing, China, which will
    be the first company-owned textile production facility in Asia.
    The Nanjing textile facility will enable us to expand and
    leverage our production scale in Asia as we balance our supply
    chain across hemispheres. In December 2007, we acquired the
    900-employee sheer hosiery facility in Las Lourdes, El Salvador
    of Inversiones Bonaventure, S.A. de C.V. For the past
    12 years, these operations had been a primary contract
    sewing operation for

Hanes

and

L’eggs

hosiery
    products. The acquisition streamlines a critical part of our
    overall hosiery supply chain and is part of our strategy to
    operate larger, company-owned production facilities.

During the year ended December 29, 2007, in furtherance of
    our efforts to execute our consolidation and globalization
    strategy, we approved actions to close 17 manufacturing
    facilities and three distribution centers in the Dominican
    Republic, Mexico, the United States, Brazil and Canada while
    moving production to lower-cost operations in Central America
    and Asia. In addition, we completed previously announced actions
    during 2007. We also have recognized accelerated depreciation
    with respect to owned or leased assets associated with 17
    manufacturing facilities and five distribution centers which we
    anticipate closing in the next three to five years as part of
    our consolidation and globalization strategy. The implementation
    of these efforts, which are designed to improve operating
    efficiencies and lower costs, has resulted and is likely to
    continue to result in significant costs and savings. As further
    plans are developed and approved by management and in some cases
    our board of directors, we expect to recognize additional
    restructuring costs to eliminate duplicative functions within
    the organization and transition a significant portion of our
    manufacturing capacity to lower-cost locations. As a result of
    these efforts, we expect to incur approximately
    $250 million in restructuring and related charges over the
    three year period following the spin off from Sara Lee,
    approximately half of which is expected to be noncash. As of
    December 29, 2007, we have recognized approximately
    $116 million in restructuring and related charges related
    to these efforts. Of these charges, $43 million relates to
    employee termination and other benefits, $61 million
    relates to accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment
    for facilities that have been or will be closed and
    $12 million relates to lease termination costs.

Finished
    Goods That Are Manufactured by Third Parties

In addition to our manufacturing capabilities, we also source
    finished goods designed by us from third-party manufacturers,
    also referred to as “turnkey products.” Many of these
    turnkey products are sourced from international suppliers by our
    strategic sourcing hubs in Hong Kong and other locations in Asia.

All contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high
    quality standards. Further, all contractors and third-party
    manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict
    supplier and business practices guidelines. These requirements
    provide strict standards covering hours of work, age of workers,
    health and



safety conditions and conformity with local laws. Each new
    supplier must be inspected and agree to comprehensive compliance
    terms prior to performance of any production on our behalf. We
    audit compliance with these standards and maintain strict
    compliance performance records. In addition to our audit
    procedures, we require certain of our suppliers to be Worldwide
    Responsible Apparel Production, or “WRAP,” certified.
    WRAP is a recognized apparel certification program that
    independently monitors and certifies compliance with certain
    specified manufacturing standards that are intended to ensure
    that a given factory produces sewn goods under lawful, humane,
    and ethical conditions. WRAP uses third-party, independent
    certification firms and requires

factory-by-factory

certification.

Trade
    Regulation

We are exposed to certain risks of doing business outside of the
    United States. We import goods from company-owned facilities in
    Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean Basin, and from
    suppliers in those areas and in Asia, Europe, Africa and the
    Middle East. These import transactions had been subject to
    constraints imposed by bilateral agreements that imposed quotas
    that limited the amount of certain categories of merchandise
    from certain countries that could be imported into the United
    States and the EU.

Pursuant to a 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing under the
    World Trade Organization, or “WTO,” effective
    January 1, 2005, the United States and other WTO member
    countries were required, with few exceptions, to remove quotas
    on goods from WTO member countries. The complete removal of
    quotas would benefit us, as well as other apparel companies, by
    allowing us to source products without quantitative limitation
    from any country. Several countries, including the United
    States, have imposed safeguard quotas on China pursuant to the
    terms of China’s Accession Agreement to the WTO, and others
    may impose similar restrictions in the future. Our management
    evaluates the possible impact of these and similar actions on
    our ability to import products from China. We do not expect the
    imposition of these safeguards to have a material impact on us.

Our management monitors new developments and risks relating to
    duties, tariffs and quotas. Changes in these areas have the
    potential to harm or, in some cases, benefit our business. In
    response to the changing import environment resulting from the
    elimination of quotas, management has chosen to continue its
    balanced approach to manufacturing and sourcing. We attempt to
    limit our sourcing exposure through geographic diversification
    with a mix of company-owned and contracted production, as well
    as shifts of production among countries and contractors. We will
    continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective
    and adjust as needed to changes in the global production
    environment.

We also monitor a number of international security risks. We are
    a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, or
    “C-TPAT,” a partnership between the government and
    private sector initiated after the events of September 11,
    2001 to improve supply chain and border security. C-TPAT
    partners work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to
    protect their supply chains from concealment of terrorist
    weapons, including weapons of mass destruction. In exchange,
    U.S. Customs and Border Protection provides reduced
    inspections at the port of arrival and expedited processing at
    the border.

Competition

The apparel essentials market is highly competitive and rapidly
    evolving. Competition generally is based upon price, brand name
    recognition, product quality, selection, service and purchasing
    convenience. Our businesses face competition today from other
    large corporations and foreign manufacturers. These competitors
    include Berskhire Hathaway Inc. through its subsidiary Fruit of
    the Loom, Inc., Warnaco Group Inc., Maidenform Brands, Inc. and
    Gildan Activewear, Inc. in our Innerwear business segment and
    Gildan Activewear, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc. through its
    subsidiaries Russell Corporation and Fruit of the Loom, Inc.,
    Nike, Inc., adidas AG through its adidas and Reebok brands and
    Under Armour Inc. in our Outerwear business segment. We also
    compete with many small manufacturers across all of our business
    segments. Additionally, department stores and other retailers,
    including many of our customers, market and sell apparel
    essentials products under private labels that compete directly
    with our brands. We also face intense competition from specialty
    stores who sell private label apparel not manufactured by us
    such as Victoria’s Secret, Old Navy and The Gap.



Our competitive strengths include our strong brands with leading
    market positions, our high-volume, core essentials focus, our
    significant scale of operations and our strong customer
    relationships.

•

Strong Brands with Leading Market
    Positions.

According to NPD, our brands hold
    either the number one or number two U.S. market position by
    sales in most product categories in which we compete, on a
    rolling year-end basis as of December 31, 2007. According
    to NPD, our largest brand,

Hanes

, is the top-selling
    apparel brand in the United States by units sold, on a rolling
    year-end basis as of December 31, 2007.

•

High-Volume, Core Essentials Focus.

We sell
    high-volume, frequently replenished apparel essentials. The
    majority of our core styles continue from year to year, with
    variations only in color, fabric or design details, and are
    frequently replenished by consumers. We believe that our status
    as a high-volume seller of core apparel essentials creates a
    more stable and predictable revenue base and reduces our
    exposure to dramatic fashion shifts often observed in the
    general apparel industry.

•

Significant Scale of Operations.

According to
    NPD, we are the largest seller of apparel essentials in the
    United States as measured by sales on a rolling year-end basis
    as of December 31, 2007. Most of our products are sold to
    large retailers that have high-volume demands. We believe that
    we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to
    provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing
    power and product design, marketing and customer management
    resources than our smaller competitors.

•

Strong Customer Relationships.

We sell our
    products primarily through large, high-volume retailers,
    including mass merchants, department stores and national chains.
    We have strong, long-term relationships with our top customers,
    including relationships of more than ten years with each of our
    top ten customers. We have aligned significant parts of our
    organization with corresponding parts of our customers’
    organizations. We also have entered into customer-specific
    programs such as the

products marketed and
    sold through Target stores.

    Corporation, of which we own a 50% share and which grants to us
    a perpetual royalty-free license to the

Playtex

trademark
    on and in connection with the sale of apparel in the United
    States and Canada. The other 50% share of Playtex Marketing
    Corporation is owned by Playtex Products, Inc., an unrelated
    third-party, which has a perpetual royalty-free license to the

Playtex

    non-apparel products in the United States. Outside the United
    States and Canada, we own the

Playtex

trademark and
    perpetually license such trademark to Playtex Products, Inc. for
    non-apparel products. In addition, as described below, as part
    of Sara Lee’s sale in February 2006 of its European branded
    apparel business, an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., or
    “Sun Capital,” has an exclusive, perpetual,
    royalty-free license to manufacture, sell and distribute apparel
    products under the

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

trademarks in the member states of the EU, as well as
    several other European nations and South Africa. We also own a
    number of copyrights. Our trademarks and copyrights are
    important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value.
    We aggressively protect these trademarks and copyrights from
    infringement and dilution through appropriate measures,
    including court actions and administrative proceedings.



Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally
    remain valid as long as they are in use

and/or

their
    registrations are properly maintained. Most of the trademarks in
    our portfolio, including our core brands, are covered by
    trademark registrations in the countries of the world in which
    we do business, with registration periods ranging between seven
    and 20 years depending on the country. Trademark
    registrations can be renewed indefinitely as long as the
    trademarks are in use. We have an active program designed to
    ensure that our trademarks are registered, renewed, protected
    and maintained. We plan to continue to use all of our core
    trademarks and plan to renew the registrations for such
    trademarks for as long as we continue to use them. Most of our
    copyrights are unregistered, although we have a sizable
    portfolio of copyrighted lace designs that are the subject of a
    number of registrations at the U.S. Copyright Office.

We place high importance on product innovation and design, and a
    number of these innovations and designs are the subject of
    patents. However, we do not regard any segment of our business
    as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related
    patents. In addition, we own proprietary trade secrets,
    technology, and know how that we have not patented.

Shared
    Trademark Relationship with Sun Capital

In February 2006, Sara Lee sold its European branded apparel
    business to an affiliate of Sun Capital. In connection with the
    sale, Sun Capital received an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free
    license to manufacture, sell and distribute apparel products
    under the

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

    member states of the EU, as well as Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
    Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Morocco, Norway, Romania,
    Russia, Serbia-Montenegro, South Africa, Switzerland, Ukraine,
    Andorra, Albania, Channel Islands, Lichtenstein, Monaco,
    Gibraltar, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion and French Guyana,
    which we refer to as the “Covered Nations.” We are not
    permitted to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded
    products in the Covered Nations, and Sun Capital is not
    permitted to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

    products inside these countries. In addition, the rights to
    certain European-originated brands previously part of Sara
    Lee’s branded apparel portfolio were transferred to Sun
    Capital and are not included in our brand portfolio.

Licensing
    Relationship with Tupperware Corporation

In December 2005, Sara Lee sold its direct selling business,
    which markets cosmetics, skin care products, toiletries and
    clothing in 18 countries, to Tupperware Corporation, or
    “Tupperware.” In connection with the sale, Dart
    Industries Inc., or “Dart,” an affiliate of
    Tupperware, received a three-year exclusive license agreement to
    use the

    for the manufacture and sale, under the applicable brands, of
    certain men’s and women’s apparel in the Philippines,
    including underwear, socks, sportswear products, bras, panties
    and girdles, and for the exhaustion of similar product inventory
    in Malaysia. Dart also received a ten-year, royalty-free,
    exclusive license to use the

    toiletries, cosmetics, intimate apparel, underwear, sports wear,
    watches, bags and towels in the Philippines. The rights and
    obligations under these agreements were assigned to us as part
    of the spin off.

In connection with the sale of Sara Lee’s direct selling
    business, Tupperware also signed two five-year distributorship
    agreements providing Tupperware with the right, which is
    exclusive for the first three years of the agreements, to
    distribute and sell, through door-to-door and similar channels,

and/or

determined to be obsolete. The agreements also provide
    Tupperware with the exclusive right for five years to distribute
    and sell through such channels such apparel items sold by us in
    the ordinary course of business. The agreements also grant a
    limited right to use such trademarks solely in connection with
    the distribution and sale of those products in Mexico.



Under the terms of the agreements, we reserve the right to apply
    for, prosecute and maintain trademark registrations in Mexico
    for those products covered by the distributorship agreement. The
    rights and obligations under these agreements were assigned to
    us as part of the spin off.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws
    and regulations that govern our activities, operations and
    products that may have adverse environmental, health and safety
    effects, including laws and regulations relating to generating
    emissions, water discharges, waste, product and packaging
    content and workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and
    regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and
    criminal sanctions. We are aware of hazardous substances or
    petroleum releases at a few of our facilities and are working
    with the relevant environmental authorities to investigate and
    address such releases. We also have been identified as a
    “potentially responsible party” at a few waste
    disposal sites undergoing investigation and cleanup under the
    federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act (commonly known as Superfund) or state Superfund
    equivalent programs. Where we have determined that a liability
    has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be
    estimated, we have accrued amounts in our balance sheet for
    losses related to these sites. Compliance with environmental
    laws and regulations and our remedial environmental obligations
    historically have not had a material impact on our operations,
    and we are not aware of any proposed regulations or remedial
    obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital
    expenditures in order to comply.

Government
    Regulation

We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and
    regulations that could affect our business, including those
    promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the
    Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the
    Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and
    regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and
    various environmental laws and regulations. Our international
    businesses are subject to similar laws and regulations in the
    countries in which they operate. Our operations also are subject
    to various international trade agreements and regulations. See
    “— Trade Regulation.” While we believe that
    we are in compliance in all material respects with all
    applicable governmental regulations, current governmental
    regulations may change or become more stringent or unforeseen
    events may occur, any of which could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Employees

As of December 29, 2007, we had approximately
    47,600 employees, approximately 11,500 of whom were located
    in the United States. Of the 11,500 employees located in
    the United States, approximately 2,200 were full or part-time
    employees in our stores within our direct to consumer channel.
    As of December 29, 2007, in the United States,
    approximately 30 employees were covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. A portion of our international employees
    were also covered by collective bargaining agreements. We
    believe our relationships with our employees are good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

This section describes circumstances or events that could have a
    negative effect on our financial results or operations or that
    could change, for the worse, existing trends in our businesses.
    The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events
    described below could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or on
    the trading prices of our common stock. The risks and
    uncertainties described in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and
    uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we
    currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our
    businesses and operations.



Risks
    Related to Our Business

We are
    in the process of relocating a significant portion of our
    manufacturing operations and this process involves significant
    costs and the risk of operational interruption.

In furtherance of our efforts to execute our consolidation and
    globalization strategy, we are relocating portions of our
    manufacturing operations to lower-cost locations such as Central
    America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia. The process of relocating
    significant portions of our manufacturing and production
    operations has resulted in and will continue to result in
    significant costs and savings. As further plans are developed
    and approved by management and in some cases our board of
    directors, we expect to recognize additional restructuring costs
    to eliminate duplicative functions within the organization and
    transition a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity
    to lower-cost locations. As a result of these efforts, we expect
    to incur approximately $250 million in restructuring and
    related charges over the three year period following the spin
    off from Sara Lee, approximately half of which is expected to be
    noncash. This process also may result in operational
    interruptions, which may have an adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Our
    supply chain relies on an extensive network of foreign
    operations and any disruption to or adverse impact on such
    operations may adversely affect our business, results of
    operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We have an extensive global supply chain in which a significant
    portion of our products are manufactured in or sourced from
    locations in Central America, the Caribbean Basin, Mexico and
    Asia. Potential events that may disrupt our foreign operations
    include:

•

political instability and acts of war or terrorism or other
    international events resulting in the disruption of trade;

•

other security risks;

•

disruptions in shipping and freight forwarding services;

•

increases in oil prices, which would increase the cost of
    shipping;

•

interruptions in the availability of basic services and
    infrastructure, including power shortages;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulting in
    uncertainty as to future asset and liability values, cost of
    goods and results of operations that are denominated in foreign
    currencies;

•

extraordinary weather conditions or natural disasters, such as
    hurricanes, earthquakes or tsunamis; and

•

the occurrence of an epidemic, the spread of which may impact
    our ability to obtain products on a timely basis.

Disruptions in our foreign supply chain could negatively impact
    our business by interrupting production in offshore facilities,
    increasing our cost of sales, disrupting merchandise deliveries,
    delaying receipt of the products into the United States or
    preventing us from sourcing our products at all. Depending on
    timing, these events could also result in lost sales,
    cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. All of the
    foregoing can have an adverse affect on our business, results of
    operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The
    integration of our information technology systems is complex,
    and delays or problems with this integration may cause serious
    disruption or harm to our business.

As we continue to consolidate our operations, we are in the
    process of integrating currently unrelated information
    technology systems across our company, which has resulted in
    operational inefficiencies and in some cases increased our
    costs. This process involves the replacement of eight
    independent systems environments running on different technology
    platforms so that our business functions are served by fewer
    platforms. We are subject to the risk that we will not be able
    to absorb the level of systems change, commit the necessary
    resources or focus the management attention necessary for the
    implementation to succeed. Many



key strategic initiatives of major business functions, such as
    our supply chain and our finance operations, depend on advanced
    capabilities enabled by the new systems and if we fail to
    properly execute or if we miss critical deadlines in the
    implementation of this initiative, we could experience serious
    disruption and harm to our business.

We
    operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and
    our market share and results of operations could be adversely
    affected if we fail to compete effectively in the
    future.

The apparel essentials market is highly competitive and evolving
    rapidly. Competition is generally based upon price, brand name
    recognition, product quality, selection, service and purchasing
    convenience. Our businesses face competition today from other
    large corporations and foreign manufacturers. These competitors
    include Berskhire Hathaway Inc. through its subsidiary Fruit of
    the Loom, Inc., Warnaco Group Inc., Maidenform Brands, Inc. and
    Gildan Activewear, Inc. in our Innerwear business segment and
    Gildan Activewear, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc. through its
    subsidiaries Russell Corporation and Fruit of the Loom, Inc.,
    Nike, Inc., adidas AG through its adidas and Reebok brands and
    Under Armour Inc. in our Outerwear business segment. We also
    compete with many small companies across all of our business
    segments. Additionally, department stores and other retailers,
    including many of our customers, market and sell apparel
    essentials products under private labels that compete directly
    with our brands. These customers may buy goods that are
    manufactured by others, which represents a lost business
    opportunity for us, or they may sell private label products
    manufactured by us, which have significantly lower gross margins
    than our branded products. We also face intense competition from
    specialty stores that sell private label apparel not
    manufactured by us, such as Victoria’s Secret, Old Navy and
    The Gap. Increased competition may result in a loss of or a
    reduction in shelf space and promotional support and reduced
    prices, in each case decreasing our cash flows, operating
    margins and profitability. Our ability to remain competitive in
    the areas of price, quality, brand recognition, research and
    product development, manufacturing and distribution will, in
    large part, determine our future success. If we fail to compete
    successfully, our market share, results of operations and
    financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

If we
    fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may be required to
    establish additional inventory reserves or we may not carry
    enough inventory to meet customer demands, causing us to suffer
    lower margins or losses.

We are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our
    inventory with our ability to meet marketplace needs. Inventory
    reserves can result from the complexity of our supply chain, a
    long manufacturing process and the seasonal nature of certain
    products. As a result, we are subject to high levels of
    obsolescence and excess stock. Based on discussions with our
    customers and internally generated projections, we produce,
    purchase

and/or

store
    raw material and finished goods inventory to meet our expected
    demand for delivery. However, we sell a large number of our
    products to a small number of customers, and these customers
    generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods.
    If, after producing and storing inventory in anticipation of
    deliveries, demand is lower than expected, we may have to hold
    inventory for extended periods or sell excess inventory at
    reduced prices, in some cases below our cost. There are inherent
    uncertainties related to the recoverability of inventory, and it
    is possible that market factors and other conditions underlying
    the valuation of inventory may change in the future and result
    in further reserve requirements. Excess inventory charges can
    reduce gross margins or result in operating losses, lowered
    plant and equipment utilization and lowered fixed operating cost
    absorption, all of which could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash
    flows.

Conversely, we also are exposed to lost business opportunities
    if we underestimate market demand and produce too little
    inventory for any particular period. Because sales of our
    products are generally not made under contract, if we do not
    carry enough inventory to satisfy our customers’ demands
    for our products within an acceptable time frame, they may seek
    to fulfill their demands from one or several of our competitors
    and may reduce the amount of business they do with us. Any such
    action could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Sales
    of and demand for our products may decrease if we fail to keep
    pace with evolving consumer preferences and trends, which could
    have an adverse effect on net sales and
    profitability.

Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond
    effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to
    translate these preferences and trends into marketable product
    offerings. If we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify
    or react to changing styles or trends or misjudge the market for
    our products, our sales may be lower than expected and we may be
    faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods
    inventory. In response, we may be forced to increase our
    marketing promotions, provide markdown allowances to our
    customers or liquidate excess merchandise, any of which could
    have a material adverse effect on our net sales and
    profitability. Our brand image may also suffer if customers
    believe that we are no longer able to offer innovative products,
    respond to consumer preferences or maintain the quality of our
    products.

We
    rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant
    portion of our sales, and the loss of or material reduction in
    sales to any of our top customers would have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations, financial
    condition and cash flows.

During the year ended December 29, 2007, our top ten
    customers accounted for 62% of our net sales and our top
    customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for 27% of our net sales. We
    expect that these customers will continue to represent a
    significant portion of our net sales in the future. In addition,
    our top customers are the largest market participants in our
    primary distribution channels across all of our product lines.
    Any loss of or material reduction in sales to any of our top ten
    customers, especially Wal-Mart, would be difficult to recapture,
    and would have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

We
    generally do not sell our products under contracts, and, as a
    result, our customers are generally not contractually obligated
    to purchase our products, which causes some uncertainty as to
    future sales and inventory levels.

We generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate
    our customers to purchase our products, and as a result, most of
    our sales are made on a purchase order basis. For example, we
    have no agreements with Wal-Mart that obligate Wal-Mart to
    purchase our products. If any of our customers experiences a
    significant downturn in its business, or fails to remain
    committed to our products or brands, the customer is generally
    under no contractual obligation to purchase our products and,
    consequently, may reduce or discontinue purchases from us. In
    the past, such actions have resulted in a decrease in sales and
    an increase in our inventory and have had an adverse effect on
    our business, results of operations, financial condition and
    cash flows. If such actions occur again in the future, our
    business, results of operations and financial condition will
    likely be similarly affected.

Continued
    growth of our existing customers could result in increased
    pricing pressure, reduced floor space for our products and other
    changes that could be harmful to our business.

The retailers to which we sell our products have grown larger,
    partly due to retailer consolidation, and, as such, now are able
    to exercise greater negotiating power when purchasing our
    products. Additionally, as our customers grow larger, they
    increasingly may require us to provide them with some of our
    products on an exclusive basis, which could cause an increase in
    the number of stock keeping units, or “SKUs,” we must
    carry and, consequently, increase our inventory levels and
    working capital requirements. Moreover, as our customers grow
    larger they may increasingly seek markdown allowances,
    incentives and other forms of economic support which reduce our
    gross margins and affect our profitability. Our financial
    performance is negatively affected by these pricing pressures
    when we are forced to reduce our prices without being able to
    correspondingly reduce our production costs.



Our
    customers generally purchase our products on credit, and as a
    result, our results of operations, financial condition and cash
    flows may be adversely affected if our customers experience
    financial difficulties.

During the past several years, various retailers, including some
    of our largest customers, have experienced significant
    difficulties, including restructurings, bankruptcies and
    liquidations. This could adversely affect us because our
    customers generally pay us after goods are delivered. Adverse
    changes in our customers’ financial position could cause us
    to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us
    to assume more credit risk relating to that customer’s
    future purchases or limit our ability to collect accounts
    receivable relating to previous purchases by that customer, all
    of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

International
    trade regulations may increase our costs or limit the amount of
    products that we can import from suppliers in a particular
    country, which could have an adverse effect on our
    business.

Because a significant amount of our manufacturing and production
    operations are in or our products are sourced from, overseas
    locations, we are subject to international trade regulations.
    The international trade regulations to which we are subject or
    may become subject include tariffs, safeguards or quotas. These
    regulations could limit the countries from which we produce or
    source our products or significantly increase the cost of
    operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain
    countries. Restrictions imposed by international trade
    regulations can have a particular impact on our business when,
    after we have moved our operations to a particular location, new
    unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable
    regulations currently in effect are changed. The countries in
    which our products are manufactured or into which they are
    imported may from time to time impose additional new
    regulations, or modify existing regulations, including:

•

additional duties, taxes, tariffs and other charges on imports,
    including retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions, which may
    or may not be based on WTO rules, and which would increase the
    cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries;

•

quantitative limits that may limit the quantity of goods which
    may be imported into the United States from a particular
    country, including the imposition of further
    “safeguard” mechanisms by the U.S. government or
    governments in other jurisdictions, limiting our ability to
    import goods from particular countries, such as China;

•

changes in the classification of products that could result in
    higher duty rates than we have historically paid;

•

modification of the trading status of certain countries;

•

requirements as to where products are manufactured;

•

creation of export licensing requirements, imposition of
    restrictions on export quantities or specification of minimum
    export pricing; or

•

creation of other restrictions on imports.

Adverse international trade regulations, including those listed
    above, would have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Significant
    fluctuations and volatility in the price of cotton and other raw
    materials we purchase may have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations, financial condition and cash
    flows.

Cotton is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of
    many of our products. Our costs for cotton yarn and cotton-based
    textiles vary based upon the fluctuating and often volatile cost
    of cotton, which is affected by weather, consumer demand,
    speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations
    and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer
    countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and
    beyond our control. In addition, fluctuations in crude oil or
    petroleum prices may also influence the prices of related items
    used in our business, such as chemicals, dyestuffs, polyester
    yarn and



foam. Rising fuel, energy and utility costs may have a
    significant impact on our manufacturing costs. These costs may
    fluctuate due to a number of factors outside our control,
    including government policy and regulation and weather
    conditions.

We are not always successful in our efforts to protect our
    business from the volatility of the market price of cotton
    through short-term supply agreements and hedges, and our
    business can be adversely affected by dramatic movements in
    cotton prices. For example, we estimate that, excluding the
    impact of futures contracts, a change of $0.01 per pound in
    cotton prices would affect our annual raw material costs by
    $3.3 million, at current levels of production. The ultimate
    effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as
    the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling
    prices are uncertain, but any dramatic increase in the price of
    cotton would have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The
    loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw
    materials may interrupt our supplies and materially harm our
    business.

We purchase all of the raw materials used in our products and
    21% of the apparel designed by us from a limited number of
    third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Our ability to meet our
    customers’ needs depends on our ability to maintain an
    uninterrupted supply of raw materials and finished products from
    our third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Our business,
    financial condition or results of operations could be adversely
    affected if any of our principal third-party suppliers or
    manufacturers experience production problems, lack of capacity
    or transportation disruptions. The magnitude of this risk
    depends upon the timing of the changes, the materials or
    products that the third-party manufacturers provide and the
    volume of production.

Our dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished
    products subjects us to the risk of supplier failure and
    customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products.
    Quality failures by our third-party manufacturers or changes in
    their financial or business condition that affect their
    production could disrupt our ability to supply quality products
    to our customers and thereby materially harm our business.

Due to
    the extensive nature of our foreign operations, fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our
    results of operations.

We sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated
    in U.S. dollars; however, we purchase many of our products,
    pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply
    chain in foreign currencies. As a result, if the
    U.S. dollar were to weaken against any of these currencies,
    our cost of sales could increase substantially. Outside the
    United States, we may pay for materials or finished products in
    U.S. dollars, and in some cases a strengthening of the
    U.S. dollar could effectively increase our costs where we
    use foreign currency to purchase the U.S. dollars we need
    to make such payments. We use foreign exchange forward and
    option contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes
    in foreign exchange rates. We are also exposed to gains and
    losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our
    Consolidated Financial Statements due to the translation of
    operating results and financial position of our foreign
    subsidiaries. In addition, currency fluctuations can impact the
    price of cotton, the primary raw material we use in our business.

We had
    approximately 47,600 employees worldwide as of
    December 29, 2007, and our business operations and
    financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in
    our relationship with our employees or changes to U.S. or
    foreign employment regulations.

We had approximately 47,600 employees worldwide as of
    December 29, 2007. This means we have a significant
    exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our
    relationships with our employees, including wage and hour laws
    and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage
    requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates,
    workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and
    payroll taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our
    operating costs. Approximately 36,100 of those employees were
    outside of the United States. A significant increase in minimum
    wage or overtime rates in countries where we have employees
    could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may
    require that we relocate those



operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases, all
    of which may cause us to incur additional costs, expend
    resources responding to such increases and lower our margins.

In addition, some of our employees are members of labor
    organizations or are covered by collective bargaining
    agreements. If there were a significant increase in the number
    of our employees who are members of labor organizations or
    become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we would
    become vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor
    action by these employees that could have an adverse effect on
    our business.

We may
    suffer negative publicity if we or our third-party manufacturers
    violate labor laws or engage in practices that are viewed as
    unethical or illegal, which could cause a loss of
    business.

We cannot fully control the business and labor practices of our
    third-party manufacturers, the majority of whom are located in
    Central America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia. If one of our own
    manufacturing operations or one of our third-party manufacturers
    violates or is accused of violating local or international labor
    laws or other applicable regulations, or engages in labor or
    other practices that would be viewed in any market in which our
    products are sold as unethical, we could suffer negative
    publicity, which could tarnish our brands’ image or result
    in a loss of sales. In addition, if such negative publicity
    affected one of our customers, it could result in a loss of
    business for us.

The
    success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation
    of our brands, including brands that we license to other
    parties. If other parties take actions that weaken, harm the
    reputation of or cause confusion with our brands, our business,
    and consequently our sales, results of operations and cash
    flows, may be adversely affected.

We license some of our important trademarks to third parties.
    For example, we license

Champion

to third parties for
    athletic-oriented accessories. Although we make concerted
    efforts to protect our brands through quality control mechanisms
    and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees, there is a
    risk that some licensees may not be in full compliance with
    those mechanisms and obligations. In that event, or if a
    licensee engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks
    that would cause us reputational harm, we could experience a
    significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely
    affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, any
    misuse of the

Wonderbra

or

Playtex

brands by Sun
    Capital could result in negative publicity and a loss of sales
    for our products under these brands, any of which may have a
    material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
    financial condition or cash flows.

We
    design, manufacture, source and sell products under trademarks
    that are licensed from third parties. If any licensor takes
    actions related to their trademarks that would cause their
    brands or our company reputational harm, our business may be
    adversely affected.

We design, manufacture, source and sell a number of our products
    under trademarks that are licensed from third parties such as
    our Polo Ralph Lauren men’s underwear. Because we do not
    control the brands licensed to us, our licensors could make
    changes to their brands or business models that could result in
    a significant downturn in a brand’s business, adversely
    affecting our sales and results of operations. If any licensor
    engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that
    would cause us reputational harm, or if any of the brands
    licensed to us violates the trademark rights of another or are
    deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, we could experience a
    significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely
    affecting our sales and results of operations, and we may be
    required to expend significant amounts on public relations,
    advertising and, possibly, legal fees.

We are
    prohibited from selling our Wonderbra and Playtex intimate
    apparel products in the EU, as well as certain other countries
    in Europe and South Africa, and therefore are unable to take
    advantage of business opportunities that may arise in such
    countries.

In February 2006, Sara Lee sold its European branded apparel
    business to Sun Capital. In connection with the sale, Sun
    Capital received an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license
    to manufacture, sell and



distribute apparel products under the

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

trademarks in the member states of the EU, as
    well as Russia, South Africa, Switzerland and certain other
    nations in Europe. Due to the exclusive license, we are not
    permitted to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded
    products in these nations and Sun Capital is not permitted to
    sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded products
    outside of these nations. Consequently, we will not be able to
    take advantage of business opportunities that may arise relating
    to the sale of

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

products in
    these nations. For more information on these sales restrictions
    see “Business — Intellectual Property.”

Our
    indebtedness subjects us to various restrictions and could
    decrease our profitability and otherwise adversely affect our
    business.

As described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources,” our indebtedness includes
    the $2.1 billion senior secured credit facility that we
    entered into on September 5, 2006 (the “Senior Secured
    Credit Facility”), the $450 million senior secured
    second lien credit facility that we entered into on
    September 5, 2006 (the “Second Lien Credit
    Facility” and, together with the Senior Secured Credit
    Facility, the “Credit Facilities”), our
    $500 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (the
    “Floating Rate Senior Notes”) and the
    $250 million accounts receivable securitization facility
    that we entered into on November 27, 2007 (the
    “Receivables Facility”). The Senior Secured Credit
    Facility, Second Lien Credit Facility and the indenture
    governing the Floating Rate Senior Notes contain restrictions
    that affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit,
    among other things, our ability to borrow funds, pay dividends
    or make other distributions, make investments, engage in
    transactions with affiliates, or create liens on our assets. In
    addition, the Credit Facilities and the Receivables Facility
    require us to maintain financial ratios. If we fail to comply
    with the covenant restrictions contained in these agreements,
    that failure could result in a default that accelerates the
    maturity of the indebtedness under such facilities.

Our leverage also could put us at a competitive disadvantage
    compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. These
    competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue
    strategic acquisitions, secure additional financing for their
    operations by incurring additional debt, expend capital to
    expand their manufacturing and production operations to
    lower-cost areas and apply pricing pressure on us. In addition,
    because many of our customers rely on us to fulfill a
    substantial portion of their apparel essentials demand, any
    concern these customers may have regarding our financial
    condition may cause them to reduce the amount of products they
    purchase from us. Our leverage could also impede our ability to
    withstand downturns in our industry or the economy in general.

Our
    indebtedness restricts our ability to obtain additional capital
    in the future.

If we need to incur additional debt or issue equity in order to
    fund working capital and capital expenditures or to make
    acquisitions and other investments, debt or equity financing may
    not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are
    not able to obtain sufficient financing, we may be unable to
    maintain or expand our business. If we raise funds through the
    issuance of debt or equity, any debt securities or preferred
    stock issued will have rights, preferences and privileges senior
    to those of holders of our common stock in the event of a
    liquidation, and the terms of the debt securities may impose
    restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through the
    issuance of equity, the issuance would dilute the ownership
    interest of our stockholders.

The restrictions contained in the Credit Facilities and in the
    indenture governing the Floating Rate Senior Notes restrict our
    ability to obtain additional capital in the future to fund
    capital expenditures or acquisitions, meet our debt payment
    obligations and capital commitments, fund any operating losses
    or future development of our business affiliates, obtain lower
    borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or
    engage in advantageous transactions that monetize our assets, or
    conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities.



If we
    fail to meet our payment or other obligations, the lenders could
    foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our
    assets.

In connection with our incurrence of indebtedness under the
    Credit Facilities, the lenders under those facilities have
    received a pledge of substantially all of our existing and
    future direct and indirect subsidiaries, with certain customary
    or

agreed-upon

exceptions for foreign subsidiaries and certain other
    subsidiaries. Additionally, these lenders generally have a lien
    on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our
    subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. The financial
    institutions that are party to the Receivables Facility have a
    lien on certain of our domestic accounts receivables. As a
    result of these pledges and liens, if we fail to meet our
    payment or other obligations under the Senior Secured Credit
    Facility, the Second Lien Credit Facility or the Receivables
    Facility, the lenders under those facilities will be entitled to
    foreclose on substantially all of our assets and, at their
    option, liquidate these assets.

To
    service our debt obligations, we may need to increase the
    portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that is
    expected to be remitted to the United States, which could
    increase our income tax expense.

We pay U.S. federal income taxes on that portion of the
    income of our foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be
    remitted to the United States and be taxable. The amount of the
    income of our foreign subsidiaries we remit to the United States
    may significantly impact our U.S. federal income tax rate.
    In order to service our debt obligations, we may need to
    increase the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries
    that we expect to remit to the United States, which may
    significantly increase our income tax expense. Consequently, our
    tax rate has been, and we believe in future periods is likely to
    continue to be, higher, on average, than our historical income
    tax rates in periods prior to our spin off from Sara Lee.

Risks
    Related to Our Status as a Newly Independent Company

We
    have a limited operating history as an independent company upon
    which our performance can be evaluated and, accordingly, our
    prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any
    newly independent company encounters.

Prior to the consummation of the spin off, we operated as part
    of Sara Lee. Accordingly, we have limited experience operating
    as an independent company and performing various corporate
    functions, including human resources, tax administration, legal
    (including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
    with the periodic reporting obligations of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, or the “Exchange Act”), treasury
    administration, investor relations, internal audit, insurance,
    information technology and telecommunications services, as well
    as the accounting for many items such as equity compensation,
    income taxes, derivatives, intangible assets and pensions. Our
    prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and
    difficulties encountered by companies in the early stages of
    independent business operations, particularly companies such as
    ours in highly competitive markets with complex supply chain
    operations.

Our
    historical financial information is not necessarily indicative
    of our results as a separate company and therefore may not be
    reliable as an indicator of our future financial
    results.

Our historical financial statements for periods prior to the
    spin off were created from Sara Lee’s financial statements
    using our historical results of operations and historical bases
    of assets and liabilities as part of Sara Lee. Accordingly,
    historical financial information for periods prior to the spin
    off is not necessarily indicative of what our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows would have been
    if we had been a separate, stand-alone entity during those
    periods.

Our historical financial information for periods prior to the
    spin off is not necessarily indicative of what our results of
    operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the
    future and, for periods prior to the spin off, does not reflect
    many significant changes in our capital structure, funding and
    operations resulting from the spin off. While our results of
    operations for periods prior to the spin off include all costs
    of Sara Lee’s branded apparel business, these costs and
    expenses do not include all of the costs that would have been or
    will be incurred by us as an independent company. In addition,
    we have not made adjustments to our



historical financial information to reflect changes, many of
    which are significant, that occurred in our cost structure,
    financing and operations as a result of the spin off, including
    the substantial debt we incurred and pension liabilities we
    assumed in connection with the spin off. These changes include
    potentially increased costs associated with reduced economies of
    scale and purchasing power.

Our effective income tax rate as reflected in our historical
    financial information for periods prior to the spin off has not
    been and may not be indicative of our future effective income
    tax rate. Among other things, the rate may be materially
    impacted by:

•

changes in the mix of our earnings from the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate;

•

the tax characteristics of our earnings;

•

the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that
    we repatriate to the United States, which may increase our tax
    expense and taxes paid; and

•

the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing
    positions in the jurisdictions in which we transact business.

If the
    IRS determines that our spin off from Sara Lee does not qualify
    as a “tax-free” distribution or a “tax-free”
    reorganization, we may be subject to substantial
    liability.

Sara Lee has received a private letter ruling from the Internal
    Revenue Service, or the “IRS,” to the effect that,
    among other things, the spin off qualifies as a tax-free
    distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes under
    Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended, or the “Internal Revenue Code,” and as part
    of a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of
    the Internal Revenue Code, and the transfer to us of assets and
    the assumption by us of liabilities in connection with the spin
    off will not result in the recognition of any gain or loss for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes to Sara Lee.

Although the private letter ruling relating to the qualification
    of the spin off under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the
    Internal Revenue Code generally is binding on the IRS, the
    continuing validity of the ruling is subject to the accuracy of
    factual representations and assumptions made in connection with
    obtaining such private letter ruling. Also, as part of the
    IRS’s general policy with respect to rulings on spin off
    transactions under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue
    Code, the private letter ruling obtained by Sara Lee is based
    upon representations by Sara Lee that certain conditions which
    are necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under
    Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal
    Revenue Code have been satisfied, rather than a determination by
    the IRS that these conditions have been satisfied. Any
    inaccuracy in these representations could invalidate the ruling.

If the spin off does not qualify for tax-free treatment for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, Sara
    Lee would be subject to tax as if it has sold the common stock
    of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value. Sara
    Lee’s stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had
    received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value
    of our common stock that was distributed to them, taxed as a
    dividend (without reduction for any portion of a Sara Lee’s
    stockholder’s basis in its shares of Sara Lee common stock)
    for U.S. federal income tax purposes and possibly for
    purposes of state and local tax law, to the extent of a Sara
    Lee’s stockholder’s pro rata share of Sara Lee’s
    current and accumulated earnings and profits (including any
    arising from the taxable gain to Sara Lee with respect to the
    spin off). It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to
    Sara Lee’s stockholders and to Sara Lee would be
    substantial.

Pursuant to a tax sharing agreement we entered into with Sara
    Lee in connection with the spin off, we agreed to indemnify Sara
    Lee and its affiliates for any liability for taxes of Sara Lee
    resulting from: (1) any action or failure to act by us or
    any of our affiliates following the completion of the spin off
    that would be inconsistent with or prohibit the spin off from
    qualifying as a tax-free transaction to Sara Lee and to Sara
    Lee’s stockholders under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D)
    of the Internal Revenue Code, or (2) any action or failure
    to act by us or any of our affiliates following the completion
    of the spin off that would be inconsistent with or cause to be
    untrue any material, information, covenant or representation
    made in connection with the private letter ruling obtained by
    Sara Lee from the IRS relating to, among other things, the
    qualification of the



spin off as a tax-free transaction described under
    Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Our indemnification obligations to Sara Lee and its affiliates
    are not limited in amount or subject to any cap. We expect that
    the amount of any such taxes to Sara Lee would be substantial.

We
    agreed with Sara Lee to certain restrictions in order to comply
    with U.S. federal income tax requirements for a tax-free spin
    off and we may not be able to engage in acquisitions and other
    strategic transactions that may otherwise be in our best
    interests.

Current U.S. federal tax law that applies to spin offs
    generally creates a presumption that the spin off would be
    taxable to Sara Lee but not to its stockholders if we engage in,
    or enter into an agreement to engage in, a plan or series of
    related transactions that would result in the acquisition of a
    50% or greater interest (by vote or by value) in our stock
    ownership during the four-year period beginning on the date that
    begins two years before the spin off, unless it is established
    that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan related to the
    spin off. U.S. Treasury Regulations generally provide that
    whether an acquisition of our stock and a spin off are part of a
    plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances,
    including specific factors listed in the regulations. In
    addition, the regulations provide certain “safe
    harbors” for acquisitions of our stock that are not
    considered to be part of a plan related to the spin off. There
    are other restrictions imposed on us under current
    U.S. federal tax law for spin offs and with which we will
    need to comply in order to preserve the favorable tax treatment
    of the distribution, such as continuing to own and manage our
    apparel business and limitations on sales or redemptions of our
    common stock for cash or other property following the
    distribution.

In our tax sharing agreement with Sara Lee, we agreed that,
    among other things, we will not take any actions that would
    result in any tax being imposed on Sara Lee as a result of the
    spin off. Further, for the two-year period following the spin
    off, we agreed, among other things, not to: (1) sell or
    otherwise issue equity securities or repurchase any of our stock
    except in certain circumstances permitted by the IRS guidelines;
    (2) voluntarily dissolve or liquidate or engage in any
    merger (except certain cash acquisition mergers), consolidation,
    or other reorganizations except for certain mergers of our
    wholly-owned subsidiaries to the extent not inconsistent with
    the tax-free status of the spin off; (3) sell, transfer or
    otherwise dispose of more than 50% of our assets, excluding any
    sales conducted in the ordinary course of business; or
    (4) cease, transfer or dispose of all or any portion of our
    socks business.

We are, however, permitted to take certain actions otherwise
    prohibited by the tax sharing agreement if we provide Sara Lee
    with an unqualified opinion of tax counsel or private letter
    ruling from the IRS, acceptable to Sara Lee, to the effect that
    these actions will not affect the tax-free nature of the spin
    off. These restrictions could substantially limit our strategic
    and operational flexibility, including our ability to finance
    our operations by issuing equity securities, make acquisitions
    using equity securities, repurchase our equity securities, raise
    money by selling assets or enter into business combination
    transactions.

The
    terms of our spin off from Sara Lee, anti-takeover provisions of
    our charter and bylaws, as well as Maryland law and our
    stockholder rights agreement, may reduce the likelihood of any
    potential change of control or unsolicited acquisition proposal
    that you might consider favorable.

The terms of our spin off from Sara Lee could delay or prevent a
    change of control that our stockholders may favor. An
    acquisition or issuance of our common stock could trigger the
    application of Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Under the tax sharing agreement that we entered into with Sara
    Lee, we are required to indemnify Sara Lee for the resulting tax
    in connection with such an acquisition or issuance and this
    indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change
    of control that our stockholders may consider favorable. Our
    charter and bylaws and Maryland law contain provisions that
    could make it harder for a third-party to acquire us without the
    consent of our board of directors. Our charter permits our board
    of directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter
    to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock
    or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we
    have the authority to issue. In addition, our board of directors
    may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock
    or preferred stock and may set the preferences, conversion or
    other rights, voting powers and other terms of the classified or
    reclassified shares. Our board of directors could establish a
    series of preferred stock that could have the effect of
    delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in
    control that might involve a premium



price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest
    of our stockholders. Our board of directors also is permitted,
    without stockholder approval, to implement a classified board
    structure at any time.

Our bylaws, which only can be amended by our board of directors,
    provide that nominations of persons for election to our board of
    directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a
    stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the
    meeting, by our board of directors or by a stockholder who is
    entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the
    advance notice procedures of our bylaws. Also, under Maryland
    law, business combinations between us and an interested
    stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder,
    including mergers, consolidations, share exchanges or, in
    circumstances specified in the statute, asset transfers or
    issuances or reclassifications of equity securities, are
    prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which
    the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. An
    interested stockholder includes any person who beneficially owns
    10% or more of the voting power of our shares or any affiliate
    or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period
    prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10%
    or more of the voting power of our stock. A person is not an
    interested stockholder under the statute if our board of
    directors approved in advance the transaction by which he
    otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However,
    in approving a transaction, our board of directors may provide
    that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time
    of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by our
    board. After the five-year prohibition, any business combination
    between us and an interested stockholder generally must be
    recommended by our board of directors and approved by two
    supermajority votes or our common stockholders must receive a
    minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares.
    The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions,
    including business combinations that are exempted by our board
    of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder
    becomes an interested stockholder.

In addition, we have adopted a stockholder rights agreement
    which provides that in the event of an acquisition of or tender
    offer for 15% of our outstanding common stock, our stockholders
    shall be granted rights to purchase our common stock at a
    certain price. The stockholder rights agreement could make it
    more difficult for a third-party to acquire our common stock
    without the approval of our board of directors.

These and other provisions of Maryland law or our charter and
    bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
    preventing a transaction or a change in control that might
    involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be
    considered favorably by our stockholders.

Properties

We own and lease properties supporting our administrative,
    manufacturing, distribution and direct outlet activities. We own
    our approximately 470,000 square-foot headquarters located
    in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which houses our various
    sales, marketing and corporate business functions. Research and
    development as well as certain product-design functions also are
    located in Winston-Salem, while other design functions are
    located in New York City.

As of December 29, 2007, we owned and leased properties in
    22 countries, including 62 manufacturing facilities and 26
    distribution centers, as well as office facilities. The leases
    for these properties expire between December 30, 2007 and
    2016, with the exception of some seasonal warehouses that we
    lease on a

month-by-month

basis. For more information about our capital lease obligations,
    see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Future
    Contractual Obligations and Commitments.”

As of December 29, 2007, we also operated 216 direct outlet
    stores in 41 states, most of which are leased under
    five-year, renewable lease agreements. We believe that our
    facilities, as well as equipment, are in good condition and meet
    our current business needs.

Legal

Item 5.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market
    for our Common Stock

Our common stock currently is traded on the New York Stock
    Exchange, or the “NYSE,” under the symbol
    “HBI.” A “when-issued” trading market for
    our common stock on the NYSE began on August 16, 2006, and
    “regular way” trading of our common stock began on
    September 6, 2006. Prior to August 16, 2006, there was
    no public market for our common stock. Each share of our common
    stock has attached to it one preferred stock purchase right.
    These rights initially will be transferable with and only with
    the transfer of the underlying share of common stock. We have
    not made any unregistered sales of our equity securities.

The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for
    our common stock for the indicated periods:

The market price of our common stock has fluctuated since the
    spin off and is likely to fluctuate in the future. Changes in
    the market price of our common stock may result from, among
    other things:

•

quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results;

•

operating results being different from analysts’ estimates;

•

changes in analysts’ earnings estimates or opinions;

•

announcements of new products or pricing policies by us or our
    competitors;

•

announcements of acquisitions by us or our competitors;

•

developments in existing customer relationships;

•

actual or perceived changes in our business strategy;

•

new litigation or developments in existing litigation;

•

sales of large amounts of our common stock;

•

changes in market conditions in the apparel essentials industry;

•

changes in general economic conditions; and

•

fluctuations in the securities markets in general.

Holders
    of Record

On February 1, 2008, there were 45,377 holders of record of
    our common stock. Because many of the shares of our common stock
    are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of
    stockholders, we are unable to determine the total number of
    stockholders represented by these record holders, but we believe
    that there were more than 113,300 beneficial owners of our
    common stock as of February 1, 2008.

Dividends

We currently do not pay regular dividends on our outstanding
    stock. The declaration of any future dividends and, if declared,
    the amount of any such dividends, will be subject to our actual
    future earnings, capital requirements, regulatory restrictions,
    debt covenants, other contractual restrictions and to the
    discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may
    take into account such matters as general business conditions,
    our financial condition and results of operations, our capital
    requirements, our prospects and such other factors as our board
    of directors may deem relevant.

Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

There were no purchases by Hanesbrands during the quarter ended
    December 29, 2007 of equity securities that are registered
    under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.



Performance
    Graph

The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder
    return on our common stock with the comparable cumulative return
    of the S&P MidCap 400 Index and the S&P 1500 Apparel,
    Accessories & Luxury Goods Index. The graph assumes
    that $100 was invested in our common stock and each index on
    August 11, 2006, the effective date of the registration of
    our common stock under Section 12 of the Exchange Act,
    although a “when-issued” trading market for our common
    stock did not begin until August 16, 2006, and
    “regular way” trading did not begin until
    September 6, 2006. The stock price performance on the
    following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock
    price performance.

COMPARISON
    OF CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN

Compliance
    with Certain New York Stock Exchange Requirements

As required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard
    A. Noll, our Chief Executive Officer must certify to the New
    York Stock Exchange each year that he is not aware of any
    violation by Hanesbrands of New York Stock Exchange corporate
    governance listing standards as of the date of his
    certification, qualifying the certification to the extent
    necessary. Mr. Noll’s certification for the six months
    ended December 30, 2006 was submitted to the New York Stock
    Exchange and did not contain any qualifications. We are filing,
    as exhibits to this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

the certifications required by Section 302 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Selected
    Financial Data

The following table presents our selected historical financial
    data. The statement of income data for the year ended
    December 29, 2007, the six-month period ended
    December 30, 2006, the year ended July 1, 2006, and
    the year ended July 2, 2005 and the balance sheet data as
    of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 have been
    derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements
    included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The statement of income data for the years ended July 3,
    2004 and June 28, 2003 and the balance sheet data as of
    July 1, 2006, July 2, 2005, July 3, 2004 and
    June 28, 2003 has been derived from our consolidated
    financial statements not included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

In October 2006, our Board of Directors approved a change in our
    fiscal year end from the Saturday closest to June 30 to the
    Saturday closest to December 31. As a result of this
    change, our consolidated financial statements include
    presentation of the transition period beginning on July 2,
    2006 and ending on December 30, 2006.

Our historical financial data for periods prior to our spin off
    from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006 is not necessarily
    indicative of our future performance or what our financial
    position and results of operations would have been if we had
    operated as a separate, stand-alone entity during all of the
    periods shown. The data should be read in conjunction with our
    historical financial statements and “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006, the number of
    shares used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share is
    96,306, which was the number of shares of our common stock
    outstanding on September 5, 2006.

Subsequent to the spin off on September 5, 2006, the number
    of shares used to compute diluted earnings per share is based on
    the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, plus the
    potential dilution that could occur if restricted stock units
    and options granted under our equity-based compensation
    arrangements were exercised or converted into common stock.

    operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily

    various factors, including but not limited to those listed under

    section provides a summary of the most recent authoritative
    accounting standards and guidance that we will be required to
    adopt in a future period.

Overview

Our
    Company

We are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading
    apparel brands, including

Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Bali,
    Just My Size, barely there

and

Wonderbra.

We design,
    manufacture, source and sell a broad range of apparel essentials
    such as t-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear,
    kids’ underwear, socks, hosiery, casualwear and activewear.
    According to NPD, our brands hold either the number one or
    number two U.S. market position by sales in most product
    categories in which we compete, on a rolling year-end basis as
    of December 31, 2007.

Our
    Segments

Our operations are managed in five operating segments, each of
    which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes:
    Innerwear, Outerwear, Hosiery, International and Other. These
    segments are organized principally by product category and
    geographic location. Management of each segment is responsible
    for the assets and operations of these businesses.

•

Innerwear.

The Innerwear segment focuses on
    core apparel essentials, and consists of products such as
    women’s intimate apparel, men’s underwear, kids’
    underwear, socks, thermals and sleepwear, marketed under
    well-known brands that are trusted by consumers. We are an
    intimate apparel category leader in the United States with our

Hanes, Playtex, Bali, Just My Size, barely there

and

Wonderbra

brands. We are also a leading manufacturer and
    marketer of men’s underwear and kids’ underwear under
    the

Hanes

and

Champion

brand names. Our net sales
    for the year ended December 29, 2007 from our Innerwear
    segment were $2.6 billion, representing approximately 57%
    of total segment net sales.

•

Outerwear.

We are a leader in the casualwear
    and activewear markets through our

Hanes, Champion

and

Just My Size

brands, where we offer products such as
    t-shirts and fleece. Our casualwear lines offer a range of
    quality, comfortable clothing for men, women and children
    marketed under the

Hanes

and

Just My Size

brands.
    The

Just My Size

brand offers casual apparel designed
    exclusively to meet the needs of plus-size women. In addition to
    activewear for men and women,

Champion

provides uniforms
    for athletic programs and includes an apparel program,

C9 by
    Champion

, at Target stores. We also license our

Champion

name for collegiate apparel and footwear. We also supply our
    t-shirts, sportshirts and fleece products primarily to
    wholesalers, who then resell to screen printers and embellishers
    through brands such as

Hanes, Champion

and

Outerbanks

. Our net sales for the year ended
    December 29, 2007 from our Outerwear segment were
    $1.2 billion, representing approximately 27% of total
    segment net sales.

•

Hosiery.

We are the leading marketer of
    women’s sheer hosiery in the United States. We compete in
    the hosiery market by striving to offer superior values and
    executing integrated marketing activities, as well as focusing
    on the style of our hosiery products. We market hosiery products
    under our

Hanes, L’eggs

and

Just My Size

brands. Our net sales for the year ended December 29,
    2007 from our Hosiery segment were $266 million,
    representing approximately 6% of total segment net sales. We
    expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue
    consistent with the overall decline in the industry (although
    the decline has slowed in recent years) and with shifts in
    consumer preferences.



•

International.

International includes products
    that span across the Innerwear, Outerwear and Hosiery reportable
    segments and include products marketed under the

Hanes,
    Champion, Wonderbra, Playtex, Rinbros, Bali and Stedman

brands. Our net sales for the year ended December 29,
    2007 from our International segment were $422 million,
    representing approximately 9% of total segment net sales and
    included sales in Latin America, Asia, Canada and Europe. Japan,
    Canada and Mexico are our largest international markets, and we
    also have sales offices in India and China.

•

Other.

Our net sales for the year ended
    December 29, 2007 in our Other segment were
    $57 million, representing approximately 1% of total segment
    net sales and are comprised of sales of nonfinished products
    such as fabric and certain other materials in the United States
    and Latin America in order to maintain asset utilization at
    certain manufacturing facilities.

Our operating results are subject to some variability.
    Generally, our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate
    the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items.
    Sales are typically higher in the last two quarters (July to
    December) of each fiscal year. Socks, hosiery and fleece
    products generally have higher sales during this period as a
    result of cooler weather, back-to-school shopping and holidays.
    Sales levels in a period are also impacted by customers’
    decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in
    response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may
    cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of
    products ordered with minimal notice to us. Our results of
    operations are also impacted by fluctuations and volatility in
    the price of cotton and the timing of actual spending for our
    media, advertising and promotion expenses. Media, advertising
    and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a
    fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns
    for retail selling seasons and product introductions. Our costs
    for cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles vary based upon the
    fluctuating cost of cotton, which is affected by weather,
    consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the
    relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of
    producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are
    generally unpredictable and beyond our control. While we do
    enter into short-term supply agreements and hedges in an attempt
    to protect our business from the volatility of the market price
    of cotton, our business can be affected by dramatic movements in
    cotton prices, although cotton represents only 6% of our cost of
    sales. Cotton prices, which were approximately 50 cents per
    pound in 2006, returned to the ten year historical average of
    approximately 56 cents per pound in 2007. Taking into
    consideration the agreements that we currently have in effect
    and cotton costs currently included in inventory, we expect our
    cost of cotton to average 62 cents per pound through August
    2008, with the first quarter being lower and the third quarter
    being higher.

Business
    and Industry Trends

Our businesses are highly competitive and evolving rapidly.
    Competition generally is based upon price, brand name
    recognition, product quality, selection, service and purchasing
    convenience. While the majority of our core styles continue from
    year to year, with variations only in color, fabric or design
    details, other products such as intimate apparel and sheer
    hosiery have a heavier emphasis on style and innovation. Our
    businesses face competition today from other large corporations
    and foreign manufacturers, as well as department stores,
    specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell
    apparel essentials products under private labels that compete
    directly with our brands.

Our distribution channels include direct to consumer sales at
    our outlet stores, national chains and department stores and
    warehouse clubs, mass-merchandise outlets and international
    sales. For the year ended December 29, 2007, approximately
    46% of our net sales were to mass merchants, 19% were to
    national chains and department stores, 8% were direct to
    consumers, 9% were in our International segment and 18% were to
    other retail channels such as embellishers, specialty retailers,
    warehouse clubs and sporting goods stores.

The retailers to which we sell our products have grown larger,
    partly due to retailer consolidation, and, as such, the number
    of retailers to which we sell our products has declined. For the
    year ended December 29, 2007, for example, our top ten
    customers accounted for 62% of our net sales and our top
    customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for over $1.2 billion of our
    sales. Our largest customers in the year ended December 29,
    2007 were Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl’s, which accounted for
    27%, 14% and 6% of total sales, respectively. The growth in
    retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow
    larger and seek to have greater concessions in



their purchase of our products, while they can be increasingly
    demanding that we provide them with some of our products on an
    exclusive basis. To counteract these effects, it has become
    increasingly important to increase operational efficiency and
    lower costs. As discussed below, for example, we are moving more
    of our supply chain to lower cost locations to lower the costs
    of our operational structure.

Anticipating changes in and managing our operations in response
    to consumer preferences remains an important element of our
    business. In recent years, we have experienced changes in our
    net sales, revenues and cash flows in accordance with changes in
    consumer preferences and trends. For example, we expect the
    trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the
    overall decline in the industry (although the decline has slowed
    in recent years) and with shifts in consumer preferences. The
    Hosiery segment only comprised 6% of our net sales in the year
    ended December 29, 2007 however, and as a result, the
    decline in the Hosiery segment has not had a significant impact
    on our net sales, revenues or cash flows. Generally, we manage
    the Hosiery segment for cash, placing an emphasis on reducing
    our cost structure and managing cash efficiently.

Our
    Key Business Strategies

Our core strategies are to build our largest, strongest brands
    in core categories by driving innovation in key items, to
    continually reduce our costs by consolidating our organization
    and globalizing our supply chain and to use our strong,
    consistent cash flows to fund business growth, supply-chain
    reorganization and debt reduction and to repurchase shares to
    offset dilution. Specifically, we intend to focus on the
    following strategic initiatives:

•

Increase the Strength of Our Brands with
    Consumers.

Driving growth platforms across
    categories is a major element of our strategy as it enables us
    to meet key consumer needs and leverage advertising dollars. We
    intend to increase our level of marketing support behind our key
    brands with targeted, effective advertising and marketing
    campaigns. For example, In 2007, we launched a number of new
    advertising and marketing initiatives. We featured Jennifer Love
    Hewitt in a new television, print and online advertising
    campaign that began in March 2007 in support of the launch of
    the

Hanes All-Over Comfort Bra with ComfortSoft

straps.
    The campaign includes new television, print and online ads. We
    launched our latest “Look Who” advertising campaign
    featuring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Michael Jordan in July 2007, in
    support of the new

Hanes ComfortSoft

Collection for Men,
    which includes the

Hanes ComfortSoft

undershirt and

ComfortSoft

underwear. Also in July 2007, we launched The

Hanes ComfortZone

Tour, a mobile marketing initiative
    focused helping men experience

ComfortSoft

product
    innovation first hand. In November 2007, we launched the first
    campaign for our

Champion

brand since 2003, a national
    advertising campaign featuring a new tagline, “How You
    Play,” designed to capture the everyday moments of fun and
    sport in a series of cool and hip lifestyle images. In the
    Spring of 2007, we launched a new “Live Beautifully”
    campaign for our

Bali

brand, which features Bali bras and
    panties from its

Passion for Comfort

,

Seductive Curve

and

Cotton Creations

lines. We launched an innovative
    and expressive advertising and marketing campaign called
    “Girl Talk” in September 2007 in which confident,
    everyday women talk about their breasts, in support of our

Playtex 18 Hour

and

Playtex Secrets

product lines.
    In October 2007, we announced a

10-year

strategic alliance with The Walt Disney Company that includes
    basic apparel exclusivity for the

Hanes

and

Champion

brands, product co-branding, attraction sponsorships and
    other brand visibility and signage at Walt Disney Parks and
    Resorts properties. Our ability to react to changing customer
    needs and industry trends will continue to be key to our
    success. Our design, research and product development teams, in
    partnership with our marketing teams, drive our efforts to bring
    innovations to market. We intend to leverage our insights into
    consumer demand in the apparel essentials industry to develop
    new products within our existing lines and to modify our
    existing core products in ways that make them more appealing,
    addressing changing customer needs and industry trends.

•

Strengthen Our Retail Relationships.

We intend
    to expand our market share at large, national retailers by
    applying our extensive category and product knowledge,
    leveraging our use of multi-functional customer management teams
    and developing new customer-specific programs such as

C9 by
    Champion

for Target. Our goal is to strengthen and deepen
    our existing strategic relationships with retailers and



develop new strategic relationships. Additionally, we plan to
    expand distribution by providing manufacturing and production of
    apparel essentials products to specialty stores and other
    distribution channels, such as direct to consumer through the
    Internet.

•

Develop a Lower-Cost Efficient Supply
    Chain.

As a provider of high-volume products, we
    are continually seeking to improve our cost-competitiveness and
    operating flexibility through supply chain initiatives. Over the
    next several years, we will continue to transition additional
    parts of our supply chain to lower-cost locations in Central
    America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia in an effort to optimize
    our cost structure. We intend to continue to self-manufacture
    core products where we can protect or gain a significant cost
    advantage through scale or in cases where we seek to protect
    proprietary processes and technology. We plan to continue to
    selectively source product categories that do not meet these
    criteria from third-party manufacturers. We expect that in
    future years our supply chain will become more balanced across
    the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. We expect that these
    changes in our supply chain will result in significant cost
    efficiencies and increased asset utilization. Our restructuring
    activities are discussed in more detail below.

•

Create a More Integrated, Focused
    Company.

Historically, we have had a
    decentralized operating structure, with many distinct operating
    units. We are in the process of consolidating functions, such as
    purchasing, finance, manufacturing/sourcing, planning, marketing
    and product development, across all of our product categories in
    the United States. We also are in the process of integrating our
    distribution operations and information technology systems. We
    believe that these initiatives will streamline our operations,
    improve our inventory management, reduce costs, standardize
    processes and allow us to distribute our products more
    effectively to retailers. We expect that our initiative to
    integrate our technology systems also will provide us with more
    timely information, increasing our ability to allocate capital
    and manage our business more effectively. We expect to continue
    to incur costs associated with the integration of these systems
    across our company over the next several years. This process
    involves the integration or replacement of eight independent
    information technology platforms so that our business functions
    are served by fewer platforms.

Supply
    Chain Consolidation and Globalization

Over the past several years, we have undertaken a variety of
    restructuring efforts designed to improve operating efficiencies
    and lower costs. We have closed plant locations, reduced our
    workforce, and relocated some of our manufacturing capacity to
    lower cost locations in Central America and Asia. For example,
    during the year ended December 29, 2007, in furtherance of
    our efforts to execute our consolidation and globalization
    strategy, we approved actions to close 17 manufacturing
    facilities and three distribution centers affecting
    6,213 employees in the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the
    United States, Brazil and Canada. In addition, 428 management
    and administrative positions are being eliminated, with the
    majority of these positions based in the United States. We also
    have recognized accelerated depreciation with respect to owned
    or leased assets associated with 17 manufacturing facilities and
    five distribution centers which we anticipate closing in the
    next three to five years as part of our consolidation and
    globalization strategy. While we believe that these efforts have
    had and will continue to have a beneficial impact on our
    operational efficiency and cost structure, we have incurred
    significant costs to implement these initiatives. In particular,
    we have recorded charges for severance and other
    employment-related obligations relating to workforce reductions,
    as well as payments in connection with lease and other contract
    terminations. These amounts are included in the “Cost of
    sales,” “Restructuring” and “Selling,
    general and administrative expenses” lines of our
    statements of income.

We acquired our second offshore textile plant, the
    1,300-employee textile manufacturing operations of Industrias
    Duraflex, S.A. de C.V., in San Juan Opico, El Salvador.
    This acquisition provides a textile base in Central America from
    which to expand and leverage our large scale as well as supply
    our sewing network throughout Central America. Also, we
    announced plans to build a textile production plant in Nanjing,
    China, which will be our first company-owned textile production
    facility in Asia. The Nanjing textile facility will enable us to
    expand and leverage our production scale in Asia as we balance
    our supply chain across hemispheres. In December 2007, we
    acquired the 900-employee sheer hosiery facility in Las Lourdes,
    El Salvador of Inversiones Bonaventure, S.A. de C.V. For the
    past 12 years, these operations had been a primary contract
    sewing operation



for

Hanes

and

L’eggs

hosiery products. The
    acquisition streamlines a critical part of our overall hosiery
    supply chain and is part of our strategy to operate larger,
    company-owned production facilities.

As a result of the restructuring actions taken since our spin
    off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006, our cost structure
    was reduced and efficiencies improved, generating savings of
    $21 million during the year ended December 29, 2007.
    Of the seven manufacturing facilities and distribution centers
    approved for closure in 2006, two were closed in 2006 and five
    were closed in 2007. Of the 20 manufacturing facilities and
    distribution centers approved for closure in 2007, 10 were
    closed in 2007 and 10 are expected to close in 2008. For more
    information about our restructuring actions, see Note 5,
    titled “Restructuring” to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

As further plans are developed and approved by management and in
    some cases our board of directors, we expect to recognize
    additional restructuring costs to eliminate duplicative
    functions within the organization and transition a significant
    portion of our manufacturing capacity to lower-cost locations.
    As a result of these efforts, we expect to incur approximately
    $250 million in restructuring and related charges over the
    three year period following the spin off from Sara Lee, of which
    approximately half is expected to be noncash. As of
    December 29, 2007, we have recognized approximately
    $116 million in restructuring and related charges related
    to these efforts. Of these charges, $43 million relates to
    employee termination and other benefits, $61 million
    relates to accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment
    for facilities that have been or will be closed and
    $12 million relates to lease termination costs.

Components
    of Net Sales and Expense

Net
    sales

We generate net sales by selling apparel essentials such as
    t-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear, kids’
    underwear, socks, hosiery, casualwear and activewear. Our net
    sales are recognized net of discounts, coupons, rebates,
    volume-based incentives and cooperative advertising costs. We
    recognize revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement (ii) the sales price is fixed or
    determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have
    been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the
    receivable is reasonably assured, which occurs primarily upon
    shipment. Net sales include an estimate for returns and
    allowances based upon historical return experience. We also
    offer a variety of sales incentives to resellers and consumers
    that are recorded as reductions to net sales.

Cost
    of sales

Our cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing finished
    goods, which consists of labor, raw materials such as cotton and
    petroleum-based products and overhead costs such as depreciation
    on owned facilities and equipment. Our cost of sales also
    includes finished goods sourced from third-party manufacturers
    that supply us with products based on our designs as well as
    charges for slow moving or obsolete inventories. Rebates,
    discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor
    related to inventory purchases are reflected in cost of sales
    when the related inventory item is sold. Our costs of sales do
    not include shipping costs, comprised of payments to third party
    shippers, or handling costs, comprised of warehousing costs in
    our distribution facilities, and thus our gross margins may not
    be comparable to those of other entities that include such costs
    in cost of sales.

Selling,
    general and administrative expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses include
    selling, advertising, costs of shipping, handling and
    distribution to our customers, research and development, rent on
    leased facilities, depreciation on owned facilities and
    equipment and other general and administrative expenses. Also
    included for periods presented prior to the spin off on
    September 5, 2006 are allocations of corporate expenses
    that consist of expenses for business insurance, medical
    insurance, employee benefit plan amounts and, because we were
    part of Sara Lee those periods, allocations from Sara Lee for
    certain centralized administration costs for treasury, real
    estate, accounting, auditing, tax, risk management, human
    resources and benefits administration. These allocations of
    centralized administration costs were determined on bases that
    we and Sara Lee considered to be reasonable



and take into consideration and include relevant operating
    profit, fixed assets, sales and payroll. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses also include management payroll,
    benefits, travel, information systems, accounting, insurance and
    legal expenses.

Restructuring

We have from time to time closed facilities and reduced
    headcount, including in connection with previously announced
    restructuring and business transformation plans. We refer to
    these activities as restructuring actions. When we decide to
    close facilities or reduce headcount, we take estimated charges
    for such restructuring, including charges for exited
    non-cancelable leases and other contractual obligations, as well
    as severance and benefits. If the actual charge is different
    from the original estimate, an adjustment is recognized in the
    period such change in estimate is identified.

Other
    expenses

Our other expenses include charges such as losses on early
    extinguishment of debt and certain other non-operating items.

Interest
    expense, net

As part of the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006,
    we incurred $2.6 billion of debt in the form of the Senior
    Secured Credit Facility, the Second Lien Credit Facility and a
    bridge loan facility (the “Bridge Loan Facility”),
    $2.4 billion of which we paid to Sara Lee. In December
    2006, we issued $500 million of floating rate senior notes
    and the proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding
    under the Bridge Loan Facility. On November 27, 2007, we
    entered into the Receivables Facility which provides for up to
    $250 million in funding accounted for as a secured
    borrowing, all of which we borrowed and used to repay a portion
    of the Senior Secured Credit Facility. As a result, our interest
    expense in the current and future periods will be substantially
    higher than in periods prior to our spin off from Sara Lee. As
    part of our historical relationship with Sara Lee, we engaged in
    intercompany borrowings. We are no longer able to borrow from
    Sara Lee.

Our interest expense is net of interest income. Interest income
    is the return we earned on our cash and cash equivalents and,
    historically, on money we loaned to Sara Lee as part of its
    corporate cash management practices. Our cash and cash
    equivalents are invested in highly liquid investments with
    original maturities of three months or less.

Income
    tax expense (benefit)

Our effective income tax rate fluctuates from period to period
    and can be materially impacted by, among other things:

•

changes in the mix of our earnings from the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate;

•

the tax characteristics of our earnings;

•

the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that
    we repatriate to the United States, which may increase our tax
    expense and taxes paid;

•

the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing
    positions in the jurisdictions in which we transact
    business; and

•

the expiration of the tax incentives for manufacturing
    operations in Puerto Rico, which were no longer in effect after
    July 1, 2006.

Inflation
    and Changing Prices

We believe that changes in net sales and in net income that have
    resulted from inflation or deflation have not been material
    during the periods presented. There is no assurance, however,
    that inflation or deflation will not materially affect us in the
    future. Cotton is the primary raw material we use to manufacture
    many of our



products and is subject to fluctuations in prices. Further
    discussion of the market sensitivity of cotton is included in
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk.”

Highlights
    from the Year Ended December 29, 2007

•

Total net sales in the year ended December 29, 2007 were
    higher by $71 million at $4.5 billion compared to the
    year ended December 30, 2006. Net sales for three of our
    four largest brands,

Hanes

,

Champion

and

Bali,

all increased in 2007.

•

Operating profit was $389 million in the year ended
    December 29, 2007, up from $366 million in the year
    ended December 30, 2006. The higher operating profit was a
    result of increased sales, cost reduction initiatives and lower
    spin off and related charges which more than offset higher costs
    associated with investments in our strategic initiatives and
    higher restructuring and related charges.

•

Diluted earnings per share were $1.30 in the year ended
    December 29, 2007, compared with $2.16 in the year ended
    December 30, 2006. The full year decline reflected higher
    interest expense as a result of our independent structure since
    the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006, higher
    restructuring costs and a higher tax rate.

•

Using cash flow from operating activities, we repaid a net
    $178 million of long-term debt, repurchased
    $44 million of company stock, and voluntarily contributed
    $48 million to our qualified pension plans during 2007.

•

We completed the final separation of pension plan assets and
    liabilities from those of our former parent in 2007. As a
    result, our U.S. qualified pension plans are approximately
    97% funded as of December 29, 2007.

•

We approved actions to close 17 manufacturing facilities and
    three distribution centers in the Dominican Republic, Mexico,
    the United States, Brazil and Canada during 2007. In addition,
    we completed previously announced restructuring actions in 2007.
    The net impact of these actions was to reduce income before
    taxes for the year ended December 29, 2007 by
    $83 million.

•

In February 2007, we entered into a first amendment to our
    senior secured credit facility with our lenders which primarily
    lowered the borrowing applicable margin with respect to the Term
    B loan facility from 2.25% to 1.75% on LIBOR based loans and
    from 1.25% to 0.75% on Base Rate loans.

In August 2007, we acquired our second offshore textile plant,
    the 1,300-employee textile manufacturing operations of
    Industrias Duraflex, S.A. de C.V., in San Juan Opico, El
    Salvador. This acquisition provides a textile base in Central
    America from which to expand and leverage our large scale as
    well as supply our sewing network throughout Central America.
    Also, we announced plans in October 2007 to build a textile
    production plant in Nanjing, China, which will be our first
    company-owned textile production facility in Asia. The Nanjing
    textile facility will enable us to expand and leverage our
    production scale in Asia as we balance our supply chain across
    hemispheres.

In October 2007, we announced a

10-year

strategic alliance with The Walt Disney Company that includes
    basic apparel exclusivity for the

Hanes

and

Champion

brands, product co-branding, attraction sponsorships and
    other brand visibility and signage at Disney properties. The
    alliance included the naming rights for the stadium at
    Disney’s Wide World of Sports Complex, now known as
    Champion Stadium.

•

In November 2007, we entered into the Receivables Facility,
    which provides for up to $250 million in funding accounted
    for as a secured borrowing, limited to the availability of
    eligible receivables, and is secured by certain domestic trade
    receivables and which we expect will reduce our overall
    borrowing costs in the future.

•

In December 2007, we acquired the 900-employee sheer hosiery
    facility in Las Lourdes, El Salvador of Inversiones Bonaventure,
    S.A. de C.V. For the past 12 years, these operations had
    been a primary contract sewing operation for

Hanes

and

L’eggs

hosiery products. The acquisition streamlines
    a critical



part of our overall hosiery supply chain and is part of our
    strategy to operate larger, company-owned production facilities.

Consolidated net sales were higher by $71 million or 1.6%
    in 2007 compared to 2006. Our Outerwear, International and Other
    segment net sales were higher by $68 million (5.9%),
    $22 million (5.4%) and $12 million (27.4%),
    respectively, and were offset by lower segment net sales in
    Innerwear of $18 million (0.7%) and Hosiery of
    $12 million (4.3%).

The overall higher net sales were primarily due to double digit
    growth in sales volume in

Champion

brand sales, growth in

Hanes

brand casualwear, socks, sleepwear, intimate
    apparel and men’s underwear sales and

Bali

brand
    intimate apparel sales. Our

Champion

brand sales have
    increased by double-digits in each of the last three years. The
    higher net sales were offset primarily by lower sales of
    promotional t-shirts sold primarily through our embellishment
    channel, lower

Playtex

brand intimate apparel sales,
    lower

Hanes

brand kids’ underwear sales and lower
    licensed men’s underwear sales in the department store
    channel.

Our strategy of investing in our largest and strongest brands is
    generating growth. In 2007, we launched a number of new
    advertising and marketing initiatives for our top brands,
    including our

Hanes ComfortSoft

campaigns,

Bali
    Passion for Comfort, Playtex

“Girl Talk” and most
    recently our

Champion

“How you Play”



advertising campaign which is the first campaign for the brand
    since 2003. We also announced a

10-year

strategic alliance with The Walt Disney Company that includes
    basic apparel exclusivity for the

Hanes

and

Champion

brands, product co-branding, attraction sponsorships and
    other brand visibility and signage at Disney properties. The
    alliance included the naming rights for the stadium at
    Disney’s Wide World of Sports Complex, now known as
    Champion Stadium.

Net sales in the Hosiery segment were lower primarily due to
    lower sales of the

L’eggs

brand to mass retailers
    and food and drug stores. We expect the trend of declining
    hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in
    the industry (although the decline has slowed in recent years)
    and with shifts in consumer preferences. The higher net sales
    from our Other segment primarily resulted from an immaterial
    change in the way we recognized sales to third party suppliers
    in 2006. The full year change was reflected in 2006 with a
    $5 million impact on net sales and minimal impact on net
    income.

The changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable
    impact on net sales of $15 million in 2007 compared to 2006.

As a percent of net sales, our gross profit percentage was 32.2%
    in 2007 compared to 32.8% in 2006. The lower gross profit
    percentage was primarily due to higher cotton costs of
    $21 million, higher excess and obsolete inventory costs of
    $21 million, $16 million of higher accelerated
    depreciation, $16 million of unfavorable product sales mix
    and $13 million of higher

start-up

and
    shut down costs associated with the consolidation and
    globalization of our supply chain. In addition, gross profit was
    negatively impacted by higher incentives of $14 million of
    which $16 million resulted from a change in the
    classification of certain sales incentives in 2007 which were
    previously classified as media, advertising and promotion
    expenses in 2006. This change in classification was made in
    accordance with

EITF 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer
    (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products)

,
    because the estimated fair value of the identifiable benefit was
    no longer obtained beginning in 2007.

Cotton prices, which were approximately 50 cents per pound in
    2006, returned to the ten year historical average of
    approximately 56 cents per pound in 2007. The higher excess and
    obsolete inventory costs in 2007 compared to 2006 are primarily
    attributable to $9 million of costs associated with the
    rationalization of our sock product category offerings and
    $5 million related to exiting a licensing arrangement for a
    kids’ underwear program. The remaining $7 million of
    higher excess and obsolete costs aggregates all other product
    categories as part of our continuous evaluation of both
    inventory levels and simplification of our product category
    offerings. The higher accelerated depreciation in 2007 was a
    result of facilities closed or that will be closed in connection
    with our consolidation and globalization strategy.

These higher costs were offset primarily by savings from our
    cost reduction initiatives and prior restructuring actions of
    $30 million, lower allocations of overhead costs of
    $24 million, $19 million of improved plant
    performance, $13 million of higher sales volume, lower duty
    costs of $9 million, primarily due to the receipt of
    $8 million in duty refunds relating to duties paid several
    years ago, and $4 million of lower spending in numerous
    other areas.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $53 million lower in 2007 compared to 2006. Our expenses
    were lower primarily due to lower spin off and related charges
    of $45 million, $12 million of savings from prior
    restructuring actions, $10 million of lower distribution
    expenses and $7 million in amortization of gain on
    curtailment of postretirement benefits. Our media, advertising
    and promotion (“MAP”) expenses were lower by
    $41 million, primarily with respect to non-media related
    MAP expenses. The lower non-media related MAP expenses are
    primarily attributable to $25 million of cost reduction
    initiatives and better deployment of these resources and
    $16 million due to a change in the classification of
    certain sales incentives in 2007 which were classified as MAP
    expenses in 2006. MAP expenses may vary from period to period
    during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising
    campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions.
    In addition, pension expense was reduced by $3 million in
    2007 as a result of the final separation of our pension assets
    and liabilities from those of Sara Lee.

Our cost reduction efforts during the year have allowed us to
    offset $7 million of higher stand alone expenses associated
    with being an independent company and make investments in our
    strategic initiatives resulting in $16 million of higher
    media related MAP expenses and $13 million in higher
    technology consulting expenses in 2007. In addition, our
    allocations of overhead costs were $24 million lower during
    2007 compared to 2006. Accelerated depreciation was
    $3 million higher in 2007 as a result of facilities closed
    or that will be closed in connection with our consolidation and
    globalization strategy.

In December 2006, we notified retirees and employees of the
    phase out of premium subsidies for early retiree medical
    coverage and move to an access-only plan for early retirees by
    the end of 2007. We also eliminated the medical plan for
    retirees ages 65 and older as a result of coverage
    available under the expansion of Medicare with Part D drug
    coverage and eliminated future postretirement life benefits. The
    gain on curtailment in 2006 represented the unrecognized amounts
    associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized
    into income over the remaining service period of the
    participants prior to the December 2006 amendments. In 2007, we
    recognized $7 million in postretirement benefit income
    which was recorded in “Selling, general and administrative
    expenses,” primarily representing the amortization of
    negative prior service costs, which was partially offset by
    service costs, interest costs on the accumulated benefit
    obligation and actuarial gains and losses accumulated in the
    plan. In December 2007, we terminated the existing plan and
    recognized a final gain on curtailment of plan benefits of
    $32 million. Concurrently with the termination of the
    existing plan, we established a new access only plan that is
    fully paid by the participants.

During 2007, we approved actions to close 17 manufacturing
    facilities and three distribution centers affecting
    6,213 employees in the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the
    United States, Brazil and Canada, while moving production to
    lower-cost operations in Central America and Asia. In addition,
    428 management and administrative positions were eliminated,
    with the majority of these positions based in the United States.
    These actions resulted in a charge of $32 million,
    representing costs associated with the planned termination of
    6,641 employees, primarily attributable to employee and
    other termination benefits recognized in accordance with benefit
    plans previously communicated to the affected employee group. In
    addition, we recognized a



charge of $10 million for estimated lease termination costs
    and $2 million primarily related to impairment charges
    associated with facility closures approved in prior periods, for
    facilities that were exited during 2007.

Of the seven manufacturing facilities and distribution centers
    that were approved for closure in 2006, two were closed in 2006
    and five were closed in 2007. Of the 20 manufacturing facilities
    and distribution centers that were approved for closure in 2007,
    10 were closed in 2007 and 10 are expected to close in 2008.

In connection with our consolidation and globalization strategy,
    non-cash charges of $37 million and $3 million,
    respectively, of accelerated depreciation of buildings and
    equipment for facilities that have been closed or will be closed
    is reflected in “Cost of sales” and “Selling,
    general and administrative expenses.”

These actions, which are a continuation of our consolidation and
    globalization strategy, are expected to result in benefits of
    moving production to lower-cost manufacturing facilities,
    leveraging our large scale in high-volume products and
    consolidating production capacity.

Interest expense, net was higher in 2007 by $120 million
    compared to 2006 primarily as a result of the indebtedness
    incurred in connection with the spin off from Sara Lee on
    September 5, 2006, consisting of $2.6 billion pursuant
    to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Second Lien Credit
    Facility and the Bridge Loan Facility. In December 2006, we
    issued $500 million of Floating Fate Senior Notes and the
    net proceeds were used to repay the Bridge Loan Facility.

In February 2007, we entered into a first amendment to the
    Senior Secured Credit Facility with our lenders, which primarily
    lowered the applicable borrowing margin with respect to the Term
    B loan facility from 2.25% to 1.75% on LIBOR based loans and
    from 1.25% to 0.75% on Base Rate loans. In November 2007, we
    entered into the Receivables Facility with conduits that issue
    commercial paper in the short-term



market and are not affiliated with us, which provides for up to
    $250 million in funding accounted for as a secured
    borrowing and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables.
    The borrowing rate is generally the conduits’ cost to issue
    commercial paper, plus certain dealer fees, which equated to
    5.93% from November 27, 2007 through December 29,
    2007. Our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt
    in 2007 was 7.74%.

Our effective income tax rate was 31.5% in 2007 compared to
    25.5% in 2006. The higher effective tax rate is attributable
    primarily to our new independent structure and higher remitted
    earnings from foreign subsidiaries in 2007.

Our effective tax rate is heavily influenced by the amount of
    permanent capital investment we make offshore to fund our supply
    chain consolidation and globalization strategy rather than
    remitting those earnings back to the United States.

As we continue to fund our supply chain consolidation and
    globalization strategy in future years, we may elect to
    permanently invest earnings from foreign subsidiaries which
    would result in a lower overall effective tax rate.

Overall net sales in the Innerwear segment were slightly lower

    experienced lower sales volume of

Playtex

brand intimate
    apparel sales of $23 million, lower

Hanes

brand
    kids’ underwear sales of $21 million, lower licensed
    men’s underwear sales in the department store channel of
    $10 million and $3 million lower

Just My Size

brand sales. The lower net sales were partially offset by
    higher

Hanes

brand socks, sleepwear, intimate apparel
    sales and men’s underwear of $11 million,
    $8 million, $5 million and $4 million,
    respectively, and higher

brand sales of

Net sales for the

Hanes

brand were higher in most key
    categories, except for kid’s underwear.

Hanes

men’s underwear benefited from an increased focus on
    core products and better overall performance at retail during
    the year-end holiday season. Total sock sales, which now exceed
    $340 million annually, were higher by 4%, primarily due to
    new programs at our top two customers. Our

Bali

brand
    sales were higher primarily as a result of our

media campaign launched in 2007.

Playtex

brand sales were lower in 2007 due to soft department store
    retail sales and a reduction in retail inventory primarily in
    the first three quarters of 2007.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage in
    the Innerwear segment was 36.8% in 2007 compared to 37.4% in
    2006. The gross profit percentage was lower due to unfavorable
    product sales mix of $19 million, higher excess and
    obsolete inventory costs of $13 million, unfavorable
    product sales pricing of $12 million, $9 million in
    higher cotton costs and unfavorable plant performance of
    $4 million. The higher excess and obsolete inventory costs
    in 2007 compared to 2006 are primarily attributable to
    $9 million of costs associated with the rationalization of
    our sock product category offerings and $5 million related
    to exiting a licensing arrangement for a kids’ underwear
    program. In addition, gross profit was negatively impacted by
    higher incentives of $15 million primarily due to a change
    in the classification of certain sales incentives in 2007 which
    were classified as media, advertising and promotion expenses in
    2006. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower
    allocations of overhead costs of $15 million, lower duty
    costs of $14 million primarily due to the receipt of
    $7 million in duty refunds relating to duties paid several
    years ago, $10 million of higher sales volume and
    $10 million in savings from our cost reduction initiatives
    and prior restructuring actions.

The lower Innerwear segment operating profit in 2007 compared to
    2006 is primarily attributable to lower gross profit and a
    higher allocation of selling, general and administrative
    expenses of $22 million. These higher expenses were
    partially offset by lower MAP expenses of $11 million,
    primarily due to a change in the classification of certain sales
    incentives in 2007 which were classified as MAP expenses in
    2006. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative
    expenses before segment allocations were lower in 2007 compared
    to 2006 primarily due to lower spin off and related charges,
    savings from prior restructuring actions, lower distribution
    expenses, amortization of gain on curtailment of postretirement
    benefits, lower MAP expenses and lower pension expense offset by
    higher stand alone expenses, lower allocations of overhead
    costs, higher accelerated depreciation and higher technology
    consulting expenses.

Net sales in the Outerwear segment were higher by
    $68 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result
    of higher

Champion

brand activewear and

Hanes

brand retail casualwear net sales. Overall activewear and
    retail casualwear net sales were higher by $60 million and
    $50 million, respectively, in 2007 compared to 2006. The
    higher net sales were partially offset by lower net sales in our
    casualwear business as a result of lower sales of promotional
    t-shirts sold primarily through our embellishment channel of
    $42 million, most of which occurred in the first half of
    2007.

Champion,

our second largest brand, benefited from
    higher penetration in the sporting goods channel, and, together
    with

C9 by Champion,

in the mid-tier department store
    channel. In 2007, we expanded the depth and breadth of
    distribution in sporting goods with our

Champion Double Dry

performance products.

Champion

sales have increased
    by double-digits in each of the past three years.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage in
    the Outerwear segment was 21.6% in 2007 compared to 19.4% in
    2006. The improvement in gross profit is primarily attributable
    to improved plant performance of $18 million, savings from
    our cost reduction initiatives and prior restructuring actions
    of $16 million, higher sales volume of $13 million,
    lower allocations of overhead costs of $9 million and



favorable product sales pricing of $8 million offset
    primarily by higher cotton costs of $11 million, higher
    excess and obsolete inventory costs of $8 million, higher
    duty costs of $4 million and higher sales incentives of
    $4 million.

The higher Outerwear segment operating profit in 2007 compared
    to 2006 is primarily attributable to a higher gross profit and
    lower MAP expenses of $3 million which was offset by a
    higher allocation of selling, general and administrative
    expenses of $28 million. Our consolidated selling, general
    and administrative expenses before segment allocations were
    lower in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to lower spin off
    and related charges, savings from prior restructuring actions,
    lower distribution expenses, amortization of gain on curtailment
    of postretirement benefits, lower MAP expenses and lower pension
    expense offset by higher stand alone expenses, lower allocations
    of overhead costs, higher accelerated depreciation and higher
    technology consulting expenses.

Net sales in the Hosiery segment were lower by $12 million
    in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to lower sales of the

L’eggs

brand to mass retailers and food and drug
    stores. We expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to
    continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry
    (although the decline has slowed in recent years) and with
    shifts in consumer preferences.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage was
    47.2% in 2007 compared to 41.3% in 2006 primarily due to
    improved plant performance of $10 million, lower sales
    incentives of $3 million and $5 million in savings
    from our cost reduction initiatives and prior restructuring
    actions which was partially offset by $10 million of lower
    sales volume.

Hosiery segment operating profit was higher in 2007 compared to
    2006 primarily due to a higher gross profit, $6 million in
    lower MAP expenses and $12 million in lower allocated
    selling, general and administrative expenses.

Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses
    before segment allocations were lower in 2007 compared to 2006
    primarily due to lower spin off and related charges, savings

Overall net sales in the International segment were higher by
    $22 million in 2007 compared to 2006. During 2007 we
    experienced higher net sales, in each case including the impact
    of foreign currency, in Europe of $17 million, higher net
    sales of $6 million in our emerging markets in Asia and
    $3 million of higher sales in Latin America, which were
    partially offset by lower sales in Canada of $5 million.
    The growth in our European casualwear business was primarily
    driven by the strength of the

Stedman

and

Hanes

brands that are sold in the embellishment channel. The
    higher sales in Asia were the result of significant retail
    distribution gains in China and India. Changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of



$15 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the
    strengthening of the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and the
    Euro.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage was
    41.3% in 2007 compared to 40.7% in 2006 primarily due to
    $4 million of lower sales incentives, $2 million of
    favorable product sales mix and $2 million of favorable
    product sales pricing.

The higher International segment operating profit in 2007
    compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to the higher gross
    profit from higher sales volume, $3 million in lower MAP
    expenses and $1 million in lower distribution expenses.
    Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable
    impact on segment operating profit of $3 million in 2007

The higher net sales from our Other segment primarily resulted
    from an immaterial change in the way we recognized sales to
    third party suppliers in 2006. The full year change was
    reflected in 2006 with a $5 million impact on net sales and
    minimal impact on segment operating profit. Net sales in this
    segment are generated for the purpose of maintaining asset
    utilization at certain manufacturing facilities.

General
    Corporate Expenses

General corporate expenses were lower in 2007 compared to 2006
    primarily due to lower spin off and related charges of
    $45 million, amortization of gain on postretirement
    benefits of $7 million and a $3 million reduction in
    pension expense related to the final separation of our pension
    plan assets and liabilities from those of Sara Lee. These lower
    expenses were partially offset by higher stand alone expenses
    associated with being an independent company of $7 million
    and $4 million of higher expenses in numerous other areas.

Net sales decreased $52 million, $12 million and
    $17 million in our Innerwear, Hosiery and Other segments,
    respectively. These declines were offset by increases in net
    sales of $13 million and $2 million in our Outerwear
    and International segments, respectively. Overall net sales
    decreased due to a $28 million impact from our intentional
    discontinuation of low-margin product lines in the Outerwear
    segment and a $12 million decrease in sheer hosiery sales.
    Additionally, the acquisition of National Textiles, L.L.C. in
    September 2005 caused a $16 million decrease in our Other
    segment as sales to this business were included in net sales in
    periods prior to the acquisition. Finally, we experienced slower
    sell-through of innerwear products in the mass merchandise and
    department store retail channels during the latter half of the
    six months ended December 30, 2006.

Cost of sales were lower year over year as a result of a

    from shifting certain production to lower cost locations. These
    savings were offset partially by higher cotton costs, unusual

    product lines, and accelerated depreciation as a result of our
    announced plans to close four textile and sewing plants in the
    United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased partially

    independent company of $10 million, excluding the corporate
    allocations associated with Sara Lee ownership in the prior year
    of $21 million. Media, advertising and promotion costs
    increased $12 million primarily due to unusual charges to
    exit certain license agreements and additional investments in
    our brands. Other unusual charges increasing selling, general
    and administrative expenses by $12 million primarily
    included certain freight revenue being moved to net sales during
    the six months ended December 30, 2006 and a reduction of
    estimated allocations to inventory costs. In addition, we
    experienced slightly higher spending of approximately
    $10 million in numerous areas such as technology
    consulting, distribution, severance and market research, which
    were partially offset by headcount savings from prior year
    restructuring actions and a reduction in pension and

In December 2006, we notified retirees and employees that we
    would phase out premium subsidies for early retiree medical
    coverage and move to an access-only plan for early retirees by
    the end of 2007. We also decided to eliminate the medical plan
    for retirees ages 65 and older as a result of coverage
    available under the expansion of Medicare with Part D drug
    coverage and eliminate future postretirement life benefits. The
    gain on curtailment represents the unrecognized amounts
    associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized
    into income over the remaining service period of the
    participants prior to the December 2006 amendments. We recorded
    postretirement benefit income related to this plan in 2007,
    primarily representing the amortization of negative prior
    service costs, which was partially offset by service costs,
    interest costs on the accumulated benefit obligation and
    actuarial gains and losses accumulated in the plan. We recorded
    a final gain on curtailment of plan benefits in December 2007.

During the six months ended December 30, 2006, we approved
    actions to close four textile and sewing plants in the United
    States, Puerto Rico and Mexico and consolidate three
    distribution centers in the United States. These actions
    resulted in a charge of $11 million, representing costs
    associated with the planned termination of 2,989 employees
    for employee termination and other benefits in accordance with
    benefit plans previously communicated to the affected employee
    group. In connection with these restructuring actions, a charge
    of $21 million for accelerated depreciation of buildings
    and equipment is reflected in the “Cost of sales” line
    of the Consolidated Statement of Income. These actions were
    expected to be completed in early 2007. These actions, which are
    a continuation of our long-term global supply chain
    globalization strategy, are expected to result in benefits of
    moving production to lower-cost manufacturing facilities,
    improved alignment of sewing operations with the flow of
    textiles, leveraging our large scale in high-volume products and
    consolidating production capacity.

Operating profit for the six months ended December 30, 2006
    decreased as compared to the six months ended December 31,
    2005 primarily as a result of facility closures announced in the
    six months ended December 30, 2006 and restructuring
    related costs of $32 million, higher non-recurring spin off
    and related charges of $17 million, higher costs associated
    with being an independent company of $10 million, unusual
    charges of $35 million primarily to exit certain contracts
    and low margin product lines, charges to exit certain license
    agreements and additional investments in our brands. In
    addition, we experienced higher cotton and production related
    costs of $29 million, lower gross margin from lower net
    sales of $16 million and slightly higher selling, general
    and administrative spending of approximately $10 million in
    numerous areas such as technology consulting, distribution,
    severance and market research. These higher costs were offset
    partially by favorable spending from our prior year
    restructuring actions, manufacturing cost savings initiatives, a
    favorable impact of shifting certain production to lower cost
    locations and lower corporate allocations from Sara Lee totaling
    $59 million and the gain on curtailment of postretirement

In connection with the spin off, we incurred $2.6 billion
    of debt pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the
    Second Lien Credit Facility and the Bridge Loan Facility,
    $2.4 billion of the proceeds of which was paid to Sara Lee.
    As a result, our net interest expense in the six months ended
    December 30, 2006 was substantially higher than in the
    comparable period.

Under the Credit Facilities, we are required to hedge a portion
    of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by
    floating rate debt issuance. During the six months ended
    December 30, 2006, we entered into various hedging
    arrangements whereby we capped the interest rate on
    $1 billion of our floating rate debt at 5.75%. We also
    entered into interest rate swaps tied to the

3-month

London Interbank Offered Rate, or “LIBOR,” whereby we
    fixed the interest rate on an aggregate of $500 million of
    our floating rate debt at a blended rate of approximately 5.16%.
    Approximately 60% of our total debt outstanding at
    December 30, 2006 was at a fixed or capped rate. There was
    no hedge ineffectiveness during the six months ended
    December 30, 2006 period related to these instruments.

In December 2006, we completed the offering of $500 million
    aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Senior Notes.
    The Floating Rate Senior Notes bear interest at a per annum
    rate, reset semiannually, equal to the six month LIBOR plus a
    margin of 3.375 percent. The proceeds from the offering
    were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Bridge

Our effective income tax rate increased from 24.3% for the six
    months ended December 31, 2005 to 33.8% for the six months
    ended December 30, 2006. The increase in our effective tax
    rate as an independent company is attributable primarily to the
    expiration of tax incentives for manufacturing in Puerto Rico of
    $9 million, which were repealed effective for the periods
    after July 1, 2006, higher taxes on remittances of foreign
    earnings for the period of $9 million and $5 million
    tax effect of lower unremitted earnings from foreign
    subsidiaries in the six months ended December 30, 2006
    taxed at rates less than the U.S. statutory rate. The tax
    expense for both periods was impacted by a number of significant
    items that are set out in the reconciliation of our effective
    tax rate to the U.S. statutory rate in Note 17 titled
    “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial

Net sales in our Innerwear segment decreased primarily due to
    lower men’s underwear and kids’ underwear sales of
    $36 million and lower thermal sales of $14 million, as
    well as additional investments in



our brands as compared to the six months ended December 31,
    2005. We experienced lower sell-through of products in the mass
    merchandise and department store retail channels primarily in
    the latter half of the six months ended December 30, 2006.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage in
    the Innerwear segment increased from 36.5% for the six months
    ended December 31, 2005 to 37.0% for the six months ended
    December 30, 2006, reflecting a positive impact of
    favorable spending of $21 million from our prior year
    restructuring actions, cost savings initiatives and savings
    associated with moving to lower cost locations. These changes
    were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of lower volumes
    of $18 million, higher cotton costs of $7 million and
    unusual costs of $8 million primarily associated with
    exiting certain low margin product lines.

The decrease in segment operating profit is primarily
    attributable to the gross profit impact of the items noted above
    and higher allocated selling, general and administrative
    expenses of $8 million. Media, advertising and promotion
    costs were slightly higher due to changes in license agreements,
    net of lower media spend on innerwear categories. Our total
    selling, general and administrative expenses before segment
    allocations increased as a result of unusual charges, higher
    stand alone costs as an independent company and higher spending
    in numerous areas such as technology consulting, distribution,
    severance and market research, which were partially offset by
    headcount savings from prior year restructuring actions and a
    reduction in pension and postretirement expenses.

Net sales in our Outerwear segment increased primarily due to
    $33 million of increased sales of activewear and
    $33 million of increased sales of boys’ fleece as
    compared to the six months ended December 31, 2005. These
    changes were partially offset by the $28 million impact of
    our intentional exit of certain lower margin fleece product
    lines, lower women’s and girls’ fleece sales of
    $16 million and $9 million of lower sportshirt, jersey
    and other fleece sales.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage
    declined from 20.7% for the six months ended December 31,
    2005 to 19.8% for the six months ended December 30, 2006
    primarily as a result of higher cotton costs of
    $11 million, $5 million associated with exiting
    certain low margin product lines and higher duty, freight and
    contractor costs of $6 million, partially offset by
    $19 million in cost savings initiatives and a favorable
    impact with shifting production to lower cost locations.

The decrease in segment operating profit is primarily
    attributable to the gross profit impact of the items noted
    above, higher media advertising and promotion expenses directly
    attributable to our casualwear products of $15 million and
    higher allocated selling, general and administrative expenses of
    $10 million. Our total selling, general and administrative
    expenses before segment allocations increased as a result of
    unusual charges, higher stand-alone costs as an independent
    company and higher spending in numerous areas such as technology
    consulting, distribution, severance and market research, which
    were partially offset by headcount savings from prior year

Net sales in our Hosiery segment decreased primarily due to the
    continued decline in U.S. sheer hosiery consumption. As
    compared to the six months ended December 31 2005, overall sales
    for the Hosiery segment declined 8% due to a continued reduction
    in sales of

L’eggs

to mass retailers and food and
    drug stores and declining sales of

Hanes

to department
    stores. Overall, the hosiery market declined 4.5% for the six
    months ended December 30, 2006.

Gross profit declined slightly primarily due to the decline in
    net sales offset by favorable spending of $3 million from
    cost savings initiatives and a reduction in pension and
    postretirement expenses.

Segment operating profit increased due primarily to
    $10 million of lower allocated selling, general and
    administrative expenses.

Net sales in our International segment increased slightly due to
    higher sales of t-shirts in Europe and higher sales in our
    emerging markets in China, India and Brazil, partially offset by
    softer sales in Mexico and lower sales in Japan due to a shift
    in the launch of fall seasonal products. Changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates increased net sales by $3 million.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage
    increased from 39.7% to 40.2% for the six months ended
    December 30, 2006. The increase resulted primarily from a
    $3 million decrease in overall spending and $1 million
    from positive changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These
    changes were offset by a $4 million impact from unfavorable
    manufacturing efficiencies compared to the prior period.

The decrease in segment operating profit is attributable to the
    gross profit impact of the items noted above offset by higher
    allocated selling, general and administrative expenses of
    $3 million.

Net sales in the Other segment decreased primarily due to the
    acquisition of National Textiles, L.L.C. in September 2005 which
    caused a $16 million decline as sales to this business were
    previously included in net sales prior to the acquisition.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage
    increased from 4.8% for the six months ended December 31,
    2005 to 9.9% for the six months ended December 30, 2006
    primarily as a result of favorable manufacturing variances.

The decrease in segment operating profit is primarily
    attributable to higher allocated selling, general and
    administrative expenses in the current period of $2 million
    offset by the favorable manufacturing variances noted above. As
    sales of this segment are generated for the purpose of
    maintaining asset utilization at certain manufacturing
    facilities, gross profit and operating profit are lower than
    those of our other segments.



General
    Corporate Expenses

General corporate expenses increased primarily due to higher
    nonrecurring spin off and related costs of $17 million and
    higher stand alone costs of $10 million of operating as an
    independent company.

Cost of sales declined year over year primarily as a result of
    the decline in net sales. As a percent of net sales, gross
    margin increased from 31.2% in 2005 to 33.2% in 2006. The
    increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a
    $140 million impact from lower cotton costs, and lower
    charges for slow moving and obsolete inventories and a
    $13 million impact from the benefits of prior year
    restructuring actions partially offset by an $84 million
    impact of lower selling prices and changes in product sales mix.
    Although our 2006 results benefitted from lower cotton prices,
    we anticipate cotton costs to increase in future periods.

The charge for restructuring in 2005 is primarily attributable
    to costs for severance actions related to the decision to
    terminate 1,126 employees, most of whom are located in the
    United States. The income from restructuring in 2006 resulted
    from the impact of certain restructuring actions that were
    completed for amounts more favorable than originally expected
    which is partially offset by $4 million of costs associated

Our effective income tax rate decreased from 36.8% in 2005 to
    22.5% in 2006. The decrease in our effective tax rate is
    attributable primarily to an $81.6 million charge in 2005
    related to the repatriation of the earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries to the United States. Of this total,
    $50.0 million was recognized in connection with the
    remittance of current year earnings to the United States, and
    $31.6 million related to earnings repatriated under the
    provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The tax
    expense for both periods was impacted by a number of significant
    items which are set out in the reconciliation of our effective
    tax rate to the U.S. statutory rate in Note 17 titled
    “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Net sales in the Innerwear segment decreased primarily due to a
    $65 million impact of our discontinuation of certain
    sleepwear, thermal and private label product lines and the
    closure of certain retail stores. Net sales were also negatively
    impacted by $15 million of lower sock sales due to both
    lower shipment volumes and lower pricing.

Gross profit percentage in the Innerwear segment increased from
    35.1% in 2005 to 37.2% in 2006, reflecting a $78 million
    impact of lower charges for slow moving and obsolete
    inventories, lower cotton costs and benefits from prior
    restructuring actions, partially offset by lower gross margins
    for socks due to pricing pressure and mix.

The increase in Innerwear segment operating profit is primarily
    attributable to the increase in gross margin and a
    $37 million impact of lower allocated selling expenses and
    other selling, general and administrative expenses due to
    headcount reductions. This is partially offset by
    $21 million related to higher allocated media advertising
    and promotion costs.

    sales of casualwear products both in the retail channel and in
    the embellishment channel, resulting from lower prices and an
    unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by a $44 million
    impact from higher sales of activewear products.

Gross profit percentage in the Outerwear segment increased from
    18.9% in 2005 to 20.0% in 2006, reflecting a $72 million
    impact of lower charges for slow moving and obsolete
    inventories, lower cotton costs, benefits from prior
    restructuring actions and the exit of certain lower-margin
    fleece product lines, partially offset by pricing pressures and
    an unfavorable sales mix of t-shirts sold in the embellishment
    channel.

The increase in Outerwear segment operating profit is primarily
    attributable to a higher gross profit percentage and a

    exit of certain low-margin product lines. Changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates increased net sales by $10 million.

Gross profit percentage increased from 39.1% in 2005 to 40.6% in
    2006. The increase is due to lower allocated selling, general
    and administrative expenses and margin improvements in sales in
    Canada resulting from greater purchasing power for contracted
    goods.

The increase in International segment operating profit is
    primarily attributable to a $7 million impact of
    improvements in gross profit in Canada.

Net sales decreased primarily due to the acquisition of National
    Textiles, L.L.C. in September 2005 which caused a
    $72 million decline as sales to this business were
    previously included in net sales prior to the acquisition. Sales
    to National Textiles, L.L.C. subsequent to the acquisition of
    this business are eliminated for purposes of segment reporting.
    This decrease was partially offset by $40 million in fabric
    sales to third parties by National Textiles, L.L.C. subsequent
    to the acquisition. An additional offset was related to
    increased sales of $7 million due to the acquisition of a
    Hong Kong based sourcing business at the end of 2005.

Gross profit and segment operating profit remained flat as
    compared to 2005. As sales in this segment are generated for the
    purpose of maintaining asset utilization at certain
    manufacturing facilities, gross profit and operating profit are
    lower than those of our other segments.

General
    Corporate Expenses

General corporate expenses not allocated to the segments
    increased in 2006 from 2005 as a result of higher incurred costs
    related to the spin off.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Trends
    and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash flows from
    operating activities and availability under our revolving loan
    facility. We believe our ability to generate cash from operating
    activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. For
    the year ended December 29, 2007, we generated
    $359 million in cash from operating activities and have
    $174 million in cash and cash equivalents at
    December 29, 2007. Barring unforeseen events, we expect
    cash flows from operating activities to be consistent in 2008
    and in future years. In addition, at December 29, 2007, our
    $500 million revolving loan facility remains undrawn and,
    after taking into account outstanding letters of credit, has



$430 million available for borrowing. We believe that our
    cash provided from operating activities, together with our
    available credit capacity, will enable us to comply with the
    terms of our indebtedness and meet presently foreseeable
    financial requirements.

The following has or is expected to impact liquidity:

•

we have principal and interest obligations under our long-term
    debt;

•

we expect to continue to invest in efforts to improve operating
    efficiencies and lower costs;

•

we expect to continue to add new manufacturing capacity in
    Central America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia;

•

we may need to decrease the portion of the income of our foreign
    subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the United
    States, which could significantly decrease our effective income
    tax rate; and

•

we expect to repurchase up to 10 million shares of our
    stock in the open market over the next few years,
    1.6 million of which we have purchased as of
    December 29, 2007.

We expect to continue the restructuring efforts that we have
    undertaken since the spin off from Sara Lee. The implementation
    of these efforts, which are designed to improve operating
    efficiencies and lower costs, has resulted and is likely to
    continue to result in significant costs and savings. As further
    plans are developed and approved by management and in some cases
    our board of directors, we expect to recognize additional
    restructuring to eliminate duplicative functions within the
    organization and transition a significant portion of our
    manufacturing capacity to lower-cost locations. As part of our
    efforts to consolidate our operations, we also expect to
    continue to incur costs associated with the integration of our
    information technology systems across our company over the next
    several years. This process involves the replacement of eight
    independent information technology platforms so that our
    business functions are served by fewer platforms.

While capital spending could vary significantly from year to
    year, we anticipate that our capital spending over the next
    three years could be as high as $500 million as we execute
    our supply chain consolidation and globalization strategy and
    complete the integration and consolidation of our technology
    systems. Capital spending in any given year over the next three
    years could be as high as $100 million in excess of our
    annual depreciation and amortization expense until the
    completion of actions related to our globalization strategy at
    which time we would expect our annual capital spending to be
    relatively comparable to our annual depreciation and
    amortization expense. The majority of our capital spending will
    be focused on growing our supply chain operations in Central
    America, the Caribbean Basin, and Asia. These locations will
    enable us to expand and leverage our large production scale as
    we balance our supply chain across hemispheres. In 2007, we
    acquired our second offshore textile plant, the 1,300-employee
    textile manufacturing operations of Industrias Duraflex, S.A. de
    C.V., in San Juan Opico, El Salvador. This acquisition
    provides a textile base in Central America from which to expand
    and leverage our large scale as well as supply our sewing
    network throughout Central America. Also, we announced plans in
    2007 to build a textile production plant in Nanjing, China,
    which will be our first company-owned textile production
    facility in Asia. The Nanjing textile facility will enable us to
    expand and leverage our production scale in Asia as we balance
    our supply chain across hemispheres. In December 2007, we
    acquired the 900-employee sheer hosiery facility in Las Lourdes,
    El Salvador of Inversiones Bonaventure, S.A. de C.V. For the
    past 12 years, these operations had been a primary contract
    sewing operation for

Hanes

and

L’eggs

hosiery
    products. The acquisition streamlines a critical part of our
    overall hosiery supply chain and is part of our strategy to
    operate larger, company-owned production facilities.

As we continue to add new manufacturing capacity in Central
    America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia, our exposure to events
    that could disrupt our foreign supply chain, including political
    instability, acts of war or terrorism or other international
    events resulting in the disruption of trade, disruptions in
    shipping and freight forwarding services, increases in oil
    prices (which would increase the cost of shipping),
    interruptions in the availability of basic services and
    infrastructure and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates, is increased. Disruptions in our foreign supply chain
    could negatively impact our liquidity by interrupting production
    in offshore facilities, increasing our cost of sales, disrupting
    merchandise deliveries, delaying



receipt of the products into the United States or preventing us
    from sourcing our products at all. Depending on timing, these
    events could also result in lost sales, cancellation charges or
    excessive markdowns.

As a result of provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006,
    we are required by law, commencing with plan years beginning
    after 2007, to make larger contributions to our pension plans
    than Sara Lee made with respect to these plans in past years.
    However, the final separation of our pension plan assets and
    liabilities from those of Sara Lee in 2007 resulted in a higher
    total amount of pension assets being transferred to us than was
    originally estimated prior to the spin off which, together with
    our voluntary contributions of $48 million in 2006 and
    $48 million in 2007 to our pension plans, has resulted in
    our U.S. qualified pension plans currently being
    approximately 97% funded which should result in minimal pension
    funding requirements in the future.

Net Cash
    from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $359 million
    in the year ended December 29, 2007 compared to
    $280 million in the year ended December 30, 2006. The
    higher cash provided from operating activities of
    $79 million was primarily the result of better management
    of working capital, partially offset by lower earnings in the
    business primarily attributable to higher interest expense, a
    higher effective income tax rate and higher restructuring and
    related charges which was partially offset by lower selling,
    general and administrative expenses. The net cash provided by
    operating activities for year ended December 29, 2007 and
    the year ended December 30, 2006 reflect $48 million
    in pension contributions each year.

Net Cash
    Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $101 million in
    the year ended December 29, 2007 compared to
    $81 million in the year ended December 30, 2006. The
    higher cash used in investing activities of $20 million was
    primarily the result of acquiring of the textile manufacturing
    operations of Industrias Duraflex, S.A. de C.V. in El Salvador
    and a sheer hosiery sewing facility operation in El Salvador and
    slightly higher purchases of property and equipment.

Net Cash
    Used in Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $243 million in
    the year ended December 29, 2007 compared to
    $556 million in the year ended December 30, 2006. The
    lower cash used in financing activities of $313 million was
    primarily the result of the elimination of net transactions with
    parent companies and related entities



subsequent to the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5,
    2006, the incurrence of $2.6 billion of indebtedness offset
    by payments of $2.4 billion to Sara Lee in connection with
    the spin off and lower net borrowings and repayments on notes
    payable in 2007, partially offset by an increase in repayments
    of debt under credit facilities and share repurchases in 2007.

On November 27, 2007, we entered into the Receivables
    Facility, which provides for borrowings up to $250 million.
    We used all $250 million of the proceeds from the
    Receivables Facility to make a prepayment of principal under the
    Senior Secured Credit Facility.

In addition to the prepayment of principal in connection with
    the Receivables Facility, we repaid $178 million of
    long-term debt, of which $175 million was a prepayment
    during the year ended December 29, 2007. We repurchased
    $44 million of company stock pursuant to a program approved
    by the Board of Directors in January 2007 which authorizes the
    repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

As of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, cash
    and cash equivalents were $174 million and
    $156 million, respectively. The higher cash and cash
    equivalents as of December 29, 2007 was primarily the
    result of management of working capital, partially offset by
    lower net income, the repayment of debt under credit facilities
    and the purchase of 1.6 million shares of our common stock
    in 2007.

Financing
    Arrangements

We believe our financing structure provides a secure base to
    support our ongoing operations and key business strategies.

In November 2007, Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services raised its outlook to ‘positive’ from
    ‘stable’ and affirmed its ‘B+’ corporate
    credit rating for us. Standard & Poor’s stated
    that the revision reflects the positive momentum since the spin
    off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006 and also stated that
    our credit protection measures and operating results are in line
    with Standard & Poor’s expectations.

In connection with the spin off, on September 5, 2006, we
    entered into the $2.15 billion Senior Secured Credit
    Facility which includes a $500 million revolving loan
    facility, or the “Revolving Loan Facility,” that was
    undrawn at the time of the spin off, the $450 million
    Second Lien Credit Facility and the $500 million Bridge
    Loan Facility. As a result of this debt incurrence, the amount
    of interest expense increased significantly in periods after the
    spin off. We paid $2.4 billion of the proceeds of these
    borrowings to Sara Lee in connection with the consummation of
    the spin off. As of December 29, 2007, we had
    $430 million of borrowing availability under the Revolving
    Loan Facilty after taking into account outstanding letters of
    credit. The Bridge Loan Facility was paid off in full through
    the issuance of the $500 million of Floating Rate Senior
    Notes issued in December 2006. On November 27, 2007, we
    entered into the Receivables Facility which provides for up to
    $250 million in funding accounted for as a secured
    borrowing, limited to the availability of eligible receivables,
    and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables. The
    proceeds from the Receivables Facility were used to pay off a
    portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

Senior
    Secured Credit Facility

The Senior Secured Credit Facility initially provided for
    aggregate borrowings of $2.15 billion, consisting of:
    (i) a $250.0 million Term A loan facility (the
    “Term A Loan Facility”); (ii) a $1.4 billion
    Term B loan facility (the “Term B Loan Facility”); and
    (iii) the $500.0 million Revolving Loan Facility that
    was undrawn as of December 29, 2007. Any issuance of
    letters of credit would reduce the amount available under the
    Revolving Loan Facility. As of December 29, 2007,
    $70 million of standby and trade letters of credit were
    issued under this facility and $430 million was available
    for borrowing. As of December 29, 2007, $139 million
    and $976 million in principal was outstanding under the
    Term A Loan Facility and Term B Loan Facility, respectively.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by
    substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect
    U.S. subsidiaries, with certain customary or

agreed-upon

exceptions for certain subsidiaries. We and



each of the guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facility
    have granted the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit
    Facility a valid and perfected first priority (subject to
    certain customary exceptions) lien and security interest in the
    following:

•

the equity interests of substantially all of our direct and
    indirect U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the voting securities
    of certain foreign subsidiaries; and

•

substantially all present and future property and assets, real
    and personal, tangible and intangible, of Hanesbrands and each
    guarantor, except for certain enumerated interests, and all
    proceeds and products of such property and assets.

The Term A Loan Facility matures on September 5, 2012. The
    Term A Loan Facility will amortize in an amount per annum equal
    to the following: year 1 — 5.00%; year 2 —
    10.00%; year 3 — 15.00%; year 4 — 20.00%;
    year 5 — 25.00%; year 6 — 25.00%. The Term B
    Loan Facility matures on September 5, 2013. The Term B Loan
    Facility will be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an
    amount equal to 1% per annum, with the balance due on the
    maturity date. The Revolving Loan Facility matures on
    September 5, 2011. All borrowings under the Revolving Loan
    Facility must be repaid in full upon maturity. Outstanding
    borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are
    prepayable without penalty. As a result of the prepayments of
    principal we have made, we do not have any mandatory payments of
    principal in 2008.

At our option, borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit
    Facility may be maintained from time to time as (a) Base
    Rate loans, which shall bear interest at the higher of
    (i) 1/2 of 1% in excess of the federal funds rate and
    (ii) the rate published in the Wall Street Journal as the
    “prime rate” (or equivalent), in each case in effect
    from time to time, plus the applicable margin in effect from
    time to time (which is currently 0.50% for the Term A Loan
    Facility and the Revolving Loan Facility and 0.75% for the Term
    B Loan Facility), or (b) LIBOR-based loans, which shall
    bear interest at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Senior Secured
    Credit Facility and adjusted for maximum reserves), as
    determined by the administrative agent for the respective
    interest period plus the applicable margin in effect from time
    to time (which is currently 150% for the Term A Loan Facility
    and the Revolving Loan Facility and 1.75% for the Term B Loan
    Facility).

In February 2007, we entered into an amendment to the Senior
    Secured Credit Facility, pursuant to which the applicable margin
    with respect to Term B Loan Facility was reduced from 2.25% to
    1.75% with respect to LIBOR-based loans and from 1.25% to 0.75%
    with respect to loans maintained as Base Rate loans. The
    amendment also provides that in the event that, prior to
    February 22, 2008, we: (i) incur a new tranche of
    replacement loans constituting obligations under the Senior
    Secured Credit Facility having an effective interest rate margin
    less than the applicable margin for loans pursuant to the Term B
    Loan Facility (“Term B Loans”), the proceeds of which
    are used to repay or return, in whole or in part, principal of
    the outstanding Term B Loans, (ii) consummate any other
    amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility that reduces the
    applicable margin for the Term B Loans, or (iii) incur
    additional Term B loans having an effective interest rate margin
    less than the applicable margin for Term B Loans, the proceeds
    of which are used in whole or in part to prepay or repay
    outstanding Term B Loans, then in any such case, we will pay to
    the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each Lender
    with outstanding Term B Loans, a fee in an amount equal to 1.0%
    of the aggregate principal amount of all Term B Loans being
    replaced on such date immediately prior to the effectiveness of
    such transaction.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires us to comply with
    customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants. The
    Senior Secured Credit Facility requires that we maintain a
    minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to
    earnings before income taxes, depreciation expense and
    amortization, or “EBITDA” ratio. The interest coverage
    covenant requires that the ratio of our EBITDA for the preceding
    four fiscal quarters to our consolidated total interest expense
    for such period shall not be less than a specified ratio for
    each fiscal quarter ending after December 15, 2006. This
    ratio was 2:25 to 1 for the quarter ended December 29, 2007
    and will increase over time until it reaches 3.25 to 1 for
    fiscal quarters ending after October 15, 2009. The total
    debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the ratio of our total
    debt to our EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters will
    not be more than a specified ratio for each fiscal quarter
    ending after December 15, 2006. This ratio was 4.50 to 1
    for the quarter ended December 29, 2007 will decline over
    time until it reaches 3 to 1 for fiscal quarters ending after
    October 15, 2009. The method of calculating all of the



components used in the covenants is included in the Senior
    Secured Credit Facility. As of December 29, 2007, we were
    in compliance with all covenants.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains customary events of
    default, including nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment
    of interest, fees or other amounts after stated grace period;
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of
    covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; any
    cross-default of more than $50 million; certain judgments
    of more than $50 million; certain events related to the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or
    “ERISA,” and a change in control (as defined in the
    Senior Secured Credit Facility).

Second
    Lien Credit Facility

The Second Lien Credit Facility provides for aggregate
    borrowings of $450 million by Hanesbrands’
    wholly-owned subsidiary, HBI Branded Apparel Limited, Inc. The
    Second Lien Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by
    Hanesbrands and each entity guaranteeing the Senior Secured
    Credit Facility, subject to the same exceptions and exclusions
    provided in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Second Lien
    Credit Facility and the guarantees in respect thereof are
    secured on a second-priority basis (subordinate only to the
    Senior Secured Credit Facility and any permitted additions
    thereto or refinancings thereof) by substantially all of the
    assets that secure the Senior Secured Credit Facility (subject
    to the same exceptions).

Loans under the Second Lien Credit Facility will bear interest
    in the same manner as those under the Senior Secured Credit
    Facility, subject to a margin of 2.75% for Base Rate loans and
    3.75% for LIBOR based loans.

The Second Lien Credit Facility requires us to comply with
    customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants. The
    Second Lien Credit Facility requires that we maintain a minimum
    interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to earnings
    before income taxes, depreciation expense and amortization, or
    “EBITDA” ratio. The interest coverage covenant
    requires that the ratio of our EBITDA for the preceding four
    fiscal quarters to our consolidated total interest expense for
    such period shall not be less than a specified ratio for each
    fiscal quarter ending after December 15, 2006. This ratio
    was 1:75 to 1 for the quarter ended December 29, 2007 and
    will increase over time until it reaches 2.5 to 1 for fiscal
    quarters ending after April 15, 2009. The total debt to
    EBITDA covenant requires that the ratio of our total debt to our
    EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters will not be more
    than a specified ratio for each fiscal quarter ending after
    December 15, 2006. This ratio was 5 to 1 for the quarter
    ended December 29, 2007 will decline over time until it
    reaches 3.75 to 1 for fiscal quarters ending after
    October 15, 2009. The method of calculating all of the
    components used in the covenants is included in the Second Lien
    Credit Facility. As of December 29, 2007, we were in
    compliance with all covenants.

The Second Lien Credit Facility contains customary events of
    default, including nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment
    of interest, fees or other amounts after stated grace period;
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of
    covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; any
    cross-default of more than $60 million; certain judgments of
    more than $60 million; certain ERISA-related events; and a
    change in control (as defined in the Second Lien Credit
    Facility).

The Second Lien Credit Facility matures on March 5, 2014,
    and includes premiums for prepayment of the loan prior to
    September 5, 2009 based on the timing of the prepayment.
    The Second Lien Credit Facility will not amortize and will be
    repaid in full on its maturity date.

Floating
    Rate Senior Notes

On December 14, 2006, we issued $500.0 million
    aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Senior Notes.
    The Floating Rate Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations
    that rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and
    future unsubordinated indebtedness. The Floating Rate Senior
    Notes bear interest at an annual rate, reset semi-annually,
    equal to LIBOR plus 3.375%. Interest is payable on the Floating
    Rate Senior Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The
    Floating Rate Senior Notes will mature on December 15,
    2014. The net proceeds from the sale of the Floating Rate Senior
    Notes were approximately



$492.0 million. As noted above, these proceeds, together
    with our working capital, were used to repay in full the
    $500 million outstanding under the Bridge Loan Facility.
    The Floating Rate Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially
    all of our domestic subsidiaries.

We may redeem some or all of the Floating Rate Senior Notes at
    any time on or after December 15, 2008 at a redemption
    price equal to the principal amount of the Floating Rate Senior
    Notes plus a premium of 102% if redeemed during the

12-month

period commencing on December 15, 2008, 101% if redeemed
    during the

12-month

period commencing on December 15, 2009 and 100% if redeemed
    during the

12-month

period commencing on December 15, 2010, as well as any
    accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. At any
    time on or prior to December 15, 2008, we may redeem up to
    35% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Senior Notes
    with the net cash proceeds of one or more sales of certain types
    of capital stock at a redemption price equal to the product of
    (x) the sum of (1) 100% and (2) a percentage
    equal to the per annum rate of interest on the Floating Rate
    Senior Notes then applicable on the date on which the notice of
    redemption is given, and (y) the principal amount thereof,
    plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date,
    provided that at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of
    the Floating Rate Senior Notes originally issued remains
    outstanding after each such redemption. At any time prior to
    December 15, 2008, we may also redeem all or a part of the
    Floating Rate Senior Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than
    60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to
    100% of the principal amount of the Floating Rate Senior Notes
    redeemed plus a specified premium as of, and accrued and unpaid
    interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date.

Accounts
    Receivable Securitization

On November 27, 2007, we entered into the Receivables
    Facility, which provides for up to $250 million in funding
    accounted for as a secured borrowing, limited to the
    availability of eligible receivables, and is secured by certain
    domestic trade receivables. The Receivables Facility will
    terminate on November 27, 2010. Under the terms of the
    Receivables Facility, the company sells, on a revolving basis,
    certain domestic trade receivables to HBI Receivables LLC
    (“Receivables LLC”), a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote
    subsidiary that in turn uses the trade receivables to secure the
    borrowings, which are funded through conduits that issue
    commercial paper in the short-term market and are not affiliated
    with us or through committed bank purchasers if the conduits
    fail to fund. The assets and liabilities of Receivables LLC are
    fully reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the
    securitization is treated as a secured borrowing for accounting
    purposes. The borrowings under the Receivables Facility remain
    outstanding throughout the term of the agreement subject to our
    maintaining sufficient eligible receivables by continuing to
    sell trade receivables to Receivables LLC unless an event of
    default occurs. Availability of funding under the facility
    depends primarily upon the eligible outstanding receivables
    balance. As of December 29, 2007, we had $250 million
    outstanding under the Receivables Facility. The outstanding
    balance under the Receivables Facility is reported on the
    Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in long-term debt
    based on the three-year term of the agreement and the fact that
    remittances on the receivables do not automatically reduce the
    outstanding borrowings.

We used all $250 million of the proceeds from the
    Receivables Facility to make a prepayment of principal under the
    Senior Secured Credit Facility. Unless the conduits fail to
    fund, the yield on the commercial paper is the conduits’
    cost to issue the commercial paper plus certain dealer fees, is
    considered a financing cost and is included in interest expense
    on the Consolidated Statement of Income. If the conduits fail to
    fund, the Receivables Facility would be funded through committed
    bank purchasers, and the interest rate payable at our option at
    the rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan as its prime
    rate or at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Receivables
    Facility) plus the applicable margin in effect from time to
    time. The average blended rate utilized for the period from
    November 27, 2007 through December 29, 2007 was 5.93%.

Notes
    Payable

Notes payable were $19.6 million at December 29, 2007
    and $14.3 million at December 30, 2006.

We have a short-term revolving facility arrangement with a
    Chinese branch of a U.S. bank amounting to RMB
    56 million ($7,661) of which $6,334 was outstanding at
    December 29, 2007 which accrues interest at



5.59%. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at the
    prevailing base lending rates published by the People’s
    Bank of China from time to time less 10%. We were in compliance
    with the covenants contained in this facility at
    December 29, 2007.

We have a short-term revolving facility arrangement with an
    Indian branch of a U.S. bank amounting to INR
    259 million ($6,560) of which $6,245 was outstanding at
    December 29, 2007 which accrues interest at 10.5%. We were
    in compliance with the covenants contained in this facility at
    December 29, 2007.

We have other short-term obligations amounting to $6,998 which
    consisted of a short-term revolving facility arrangement with a
    Japanese branch of a U.S. bank amounting to JPY
    1,100 million ($9,671) of which $2,010 was outstanding at
    December 29, 2007 which accrues interest at 2.50%, multiple
    short-term credit facilities and promissory notes acquired as
    part of our acquisition of a sewing facility in Thailand,
    totaling THB 200 million ($6,612) of which $1,339 was
    outstanding at December 29, 2007 which accrues interest at
    an average rate of 5.59%, and a short-term revolving facility
    arrangement with a Mexican branch of a U.S. bank amounting
    to MXN 163 million ($15,024) of which $3,649 was
    outstanding at December 29, 2007 which accrues interest at
    9.42%. We were in compliance with the covenants contained in the
    facilities at December 29, 2007.

In addition, we have short-term revolving credit facilities in
    various other locations that can be drawn on from time to time
    amounting to $64 million of which $0 was outstanding at
    December 29, 2007.

In connection with the acquisition of Industrias Duraflex, S.A.
    de C.V. in August, 2007, we issued a non-interest bearing note
    payable to the former owners in the amount of $27 million
    that was paid in full as of December 29, 2007.

Derivatives

We are required under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the
    Second Lien Credit Facility to hedge a portion of our floating
    rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate
    debt issuance. At December 29, 2007, we have outstanding
    hedging arrangements whereby we capped the interest rate on
    $950 million of our floating rate debt at 5.75%. We also
    entered into interest rate swaps tied to the

3-month

and

6-month

LIBOR rates whereby we fixed the interest rate on an aggregate
    of $600 million of our floating rate debt at a blended rate
    of approximately 5.04%. Approximately 67% of our total debt
    outstanding at December 29, 2007 is at a fixed or capped
    rate. There was no hedge ineffectiveness during the current
    period related to these instruments.

We use forward exchange and option contracts to reduce the
    effect of fluctuating foreign currencies for a portion of our
    anticipated short-term foreign currency-denominated transactions.

Cotton is the primary raw material we use to manufacture many of
    our products. We generally purchase our raw materials at market
    prices. In the year ended July 1, 2006, we started to use
    commodity financial instruments, options and forward contracts
    to hedge the price of cotton, for which there is a high
    correlation between the hedged item and the hedged instrument.
    We generally do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge
    other raw material commodity prices.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We engage in off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe are
    reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations. These off-balance
    sheet arrangements include operating leases for manufacturing
    facilities, warehouses, office space, vehicles and machinery and
    equipment.

Minimum operating lease obligations are scheduled to be paid as
    follows: $35.4 million in 2008, $29.6 million in 2009,
    $25.0 million in 2010, $20.2 million in 2011,
    $15.1 million in 2012 and $35.2 million thereafter.

Due to our current funded status of our pension plans, we are
    not obligated to make any contributions to the plan in the next
    year. The future timing of the pension funding obligations
    associated with our defined benefit pension and post-retirement
    plans beyond the next year is dependent on a number of factors
    including investment results and other factors that contribute
    to future pension expense and cannot be reasonably estimated at
    this time. A discussion of our pension and postretirement plans
    is included in Notes 15 and 16 to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Our obligations for employee health and
    property and casualty losses are also excluded from the table.

Pension
    Plans

In conjunction with the spin off which occurred on
    September 5, 2006, we established the Hanesbrands Inc.
    Pension and Retirement Plan, which assumed the portion of the
    underfunded liabilities and the portion of the assets of pension
    plans sponsored by Sara Lee that relate to our employees. In
    addition, we assumed sponsorship of certain other Sara Lee plans
    and will continue sponsorship of the Playtex Apparel Inc.
    Pension Plan and the National Textiles, L.L.C. Pension Plan.



Since the spin off, we have voluntarily contributed
    $96 million to our pension plans. Additionally, during 2007
    we completed the separation of our pension plan assets and
    liabilities from those of Sara Lee in accordance with
    governmental regulations, which resulted in a higher total
    amount of pension plan assets of approximately $74 million
    being transferred to us than originally was estimated prior to
    the spin off. Prior to spin off, the fair value of plan assets
    included in the annual valuations represented a best estimate
    based upon a percentage allocation of total assets of the Sara
    Lee trust. Our U.S. qualified pension plans are
    approximately 97% funded as of December 29, 2007.

Share
    Repurchase Program

On February 1, 2007, we announced that our Board of
    Directors granted authority for the repurchase of up to
    10 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases
    are made periodically in open-market transactions, and are
    subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other
    factors. Additionally, management has been granted authority to
    establish a trading plan under

Rule 10b5-1

of the Exchange Act in connection with share repurchases, which
    will allow use to repurchase shares in the open market during
    periods in which the stock trading window is otherwise closed
    for our company and certain of our officers and employees
    pursuant to our insider trading policy. During 2007, we
    purchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost
    of $44.5 million (average price of $27.55). The primary
    objective of our share repurchase program is to reduce the
    impact of dilution caused by the exercise of options and vesting
    of stock unit awards.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are
    appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating
    results and financial position in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply
    these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our
    significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2,
    titled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,”
    to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The application of critical accounting policies requires that we
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
    disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on
    historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the
    circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an
    ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in
    our evaluation. If actual results ultimately differ from
    previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of
    operations in the period in which the actual amounts become
    known. The critical accounting policies that involve the most
    significant management judgments and estimates used in
    preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, or are the
    most sensitive to change from outside factors, are the following:

Sales
    Recognition and Incentives

We recognize revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence
    of an arrangement, (ii) the sales price is fixed or
    determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have
    been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the
    receivable is reasonably assured, which occurs primarily upon
    shipment. We record provisions for any uncollectible amounts
    based upon our historical collection statistics and current
    customer information. Our management reviews these estimates
    each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience.

Note 2(d), titled “Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies — Sales Recognition and Incentives,” to
    our Consolidated Financial Statements describes a variety of
    sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our
    products. Measuring the cost of these incentives requires, in
    many cases, estimating future customer utilization and
    redemption rates. We use historical data for similar
    transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs.
    Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes
    adjustments based upon actual experience and other available
    information. For the year ended December 29, 2007, we
    changed the manner in which we accounted for cooperative
    advertising that resulted in a change in the classification from
    media, advertising and promotion expenses to a reduction of
    sales. This change in



classification was made in accordance with

EITF 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer
    (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products)

,
    because the estimated fair value of the identifiable benefit was
    no longer obtained beginning in 2007.

Catalog
    Expenses

We incur expenses for printing catalogs for our products to aid
    in our sales efforts. We initially record these expenses as a
    prepaid item and charge it against selling, general and
    administrative expenses over time as the catalog is used.
    Expenses are recognized at a rate that approximates our
    historical experience with regard to the timing and amount of
    sales attributable to a catalog distribution.

Inventory
    Valuation

We carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower
    of cost or market. Cost is determined by the

first-in,

first-out, or “FIFO,” method for our inventories at
    December 29, 2007. We carry obsolete, damaged, and excess
    inventory at the net realizable value, which we determine by
    assessing historical recovery rates, current market conditions
    and our future marketing and sales plans. Because our assessment
    of net realizable value is made at a point in time, there are
    inherent uncertainties related to our value determination.
    Market factors and other conditions underlying the net
    realizable value may change, resulting in further reserve
    requirements. A reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory
    item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the
    item that cannot be reversed at a later period. While we believe
    that adequate write-downs for inventory obsolescence have been
    provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements, consumer
    tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could
    experience additional inventory write-downs in the future.

Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from a
    vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as
    reductions in the cost of the related inventory item, and are
    therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory
    item is sold.

Income
    Taxes

Prior to spin off on September 5, 2006, all income taxes
    were computed and reported on a separate return basis as if we
    were not part of Sara Lee. Deferred taxes were recognized for
    the future tax effects of temporary differences between
    financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for
    the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Net
    operating loss carryforwards had been determined in our
    Consolidated Financial Statements as if we were separate from
    Sara Lee, resulting in a different net operating loss
    carryforward amount than reflected by Sara Lee. Given our
    continuing losses in certain geographic locations on a separate
    return basis, a valuation allowance has been established for the
    deferred tax assets relating to these specific locations.
    Federal income taxes are provided on that portion of our income
    of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the
    United States and be taxable, reflecting the historical
    decisions made by Sara Lee with regards to earnings permanently
    reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. In periods after the spin
    off, we may make different decisions as to the amount of
    earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions, due to
    anticipated cash flow or other business requirements, which may
    impact our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate.

We periodically estimate the probable tax obligations using
    historical experience in tax jurisdictions and our informed
    judgment. There are inherent uncertainties related to the
    interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which
    we transact business. The judgments and estimates made at a
    point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, as
    well as changes to, or further interpretations of, regulations.
    Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these
    events occur, and these adjustments are included in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income. If such changes take place,
    there is a risk that our effective tax rate may increase or
    decrease in any period. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), which became effective during the
    year ended December 29, 2007. FIN 48 addresses the
    determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be
    claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
    statements. Under FIN 48, a company must



recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
    it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
    technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
    the financial statements from such a position are measured based
    on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
    likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

In conjunction with the spin off, we and Sara Lee entered into a
    tax sharing agreement, which allocates responsibilities between
    us and Sara Lee for taxes and certain other tax matters. Under
    the tax sharing agreement, Sara Lee generally is liable for all
    U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes
    attributable to us with respect to taxable periods ending on or
    before September 5, 2006. Sara Lee also is liable for
    income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods
    beginning before September 5, 2006 and ending after
    September 5, 2006, but only to the extent those taxes are
    allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on
    September 5, 2006. We are generally liable for all other
    taxes attributable to us. Changes in the amounts payable or
    receivable by us under the stipulations of this agreement may
    impact our tax provision in any period.

Within 180 days after Sara Lee files its final consolidated
    tax return for the period that includes September 5, 2006,
    Sara Lee is required to deliver to us a computation of the
    amount of deferred taxes attributable to our United States and
    Canadian operations that would be included on our balance sheet
    as of September 6, 2006. If substituting the amount of
    deferred taxes as finally determined for the amount of estimated
    deferred taxes that were included on that balance sheet at the
    time of the spin off causes a decrease in the net book value
    reflected on that balance sheet, then Sara Lee will be required
    to pay us the amount of such decrease. If such substitution
    causes an increase in the net book value reflected on that
    balance sheet, then we will be required to pay Sara Lee the
    amount of such increase. For purposes of this computation, our
    deferred taxes are the amount of deferred tax benefits
    (including deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible
    temporary differences and carryforwards) that would be
    recognized as assets on our balance sheet computed in accordance
    with GAAP, but without regard to valuation allowances, less the
    amount of deferred tax liabilities (including deferred tax
    consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences)
    that would be recognized as liabilities on our balance sheet
    computed in accordance with GAAP, but without regard to
    valuation allowances. Neither we nor Sara Lee will be required
    to make any other payments to the other with respect to deferred
    taxes.

Stock
    Compensation

We established the Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan of
    2006, the (“Omnibus Incentive Plan”) to award stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
    stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash
    to our employees, non-employee directors and employees of our
    subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent
    performance and retention of employees. We account for
    stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

. Under SFAS 123R, stock-based
    compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the
    award’s fair value and is recognized as expense over the
    requisite service period. Estimation of stock-based compensation
    for stock options granted, utilizing the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model, requires various highly subjective
    assumptions including volatility and expected option life. We
    use the volatility of peer companies for a period of time that
    is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine
    volatility assumptions. We have utilized the simplified method
    outlined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 to
    estimate expected lives of options granted during the period.
    SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 110, which was
    issued in December 2007, amends SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 107 and gives a limited extension on
    using the simplified method for valuing stock option grants to
    eligible public companies that do not have sufficient historical
    exercise patterns on options granted to employees. Further, as
    required under SFAS No. 123R, we estimate forfeitures
    for stock-based awards granted, which are not expected to vest.
    If any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly, our
    stock-based compensation expense could be materially different
    in the future.



Defined
    Benefit Pension and Postretirement Healthcare and Life Insurance
    Plans

For a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost, plan
    obligations, plan assets, and how we measure the amount of these
    costs, see Notes 15 and 16 titled “Defined Benefit
    Pension Plans” and “Postretirement Healthcare and Life
    Insurance Plans,” respectively, to our Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In conjunction with the spin off from Sara Lee which occurred on
    September 5, 2006, we established the Hanesbrands Inc.
    Pension and Retirement Plan, which assumed the portion of the
    underfunded liabilities and the portion of the assets of pension
    plans sponsored by Sara Lee that relate to our employees. In
    addition, we assumed sponsorship of certain other Sara Lee plans
    and will continue sponsorship of the Playtex Apparel Inc.
    Pension Plan and the National Textiles, L.L.C. Pension Plan. As
    of January 1, 2006, the benefits under these plans were
    frozen. Since the spin off, we have voluntarily contributed
    $96 million to our pension plans. Additionally, during 2007
    we completed the separation of our pension plan assets and
    liabilities from those of Sara Lee in accordance with
    governmental regulations, which resulted in a higher total
    amount of pension plan assets of approximately $74 million
    being transferred to us than originally was estimated prior to
    the spin off. As a result, our U.S. qualified pension plans
    are approximately 97% funded as of December 29, 2007.

In December 2006, we changed the postretirement plan benefits to
    (a) pass along a higher share of retiree medical costs to
    all retirees effective February 1, 2007, (b) eliminate
    company contributions toward premiums for retiree medical
    coverage effective December 1, 2007, (c) eliminate
    retiree medical coverage options for all current and future
    retirees age 65 and older and (d) eliminate future
    postretirement life benefits. Gains associated with these plan
    amendments were amortized throughout the year ended
    December 29, 2007 in anticipation of the effective
    termination of the medical plan on December 1, 2007. On
    December 1, 2007 we effectively terminated all retiree
    medical coverage. A final gain on curtailment of
    $32 million was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of
    Income in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 29,
    2007. Concurrently with the termination of the existing plan, we
    established a new access only plan that is fully paid by the
    participants.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
    “FASB,” issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (SFAS 158”).
    SFAS 158 requires that the funded status of defined benefit
    postretirement plans be recognized on a company’s balance
    sheet, and changes in the funded status be reflected in
    comprehensive income, effective fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2006, which we adopted as of and for the six
    months ended December 30, 2006. The impact of adopting the
    funded status provisions of SFAS 158 was an increase in
    assets of $1 million, an increase in liabilities of
    $26 million and a pretax increase in the accumulated other
    comprehensive loss of $32 million. SFAS 158 also
    requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as
    of the date of its fiscal year end, effective for fiscal years
    ending after December 15, 2008. We adopted the measurement
    date provision during the year ended December 29, 2007,
    which had an immaterial impact on beginning retained earnings,
    accumulated other comprehensive income and pension liabilities.

The net periodic cost of the pension and postretirement plans is
    determined using projections and actuarial assumptions, the most
    significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate
    of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical
    costs). The net periodic pension and postretirement income or
    expense is recognized in the year incurred. Gains and losses,
    which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial
    assumptions, are amortized over the average future service
    period of employees.

Our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions
    are as follows:

•

In determining the discount rate, we utilized the Citigroup
    Pension Discount Curve (rounded to the nearest 10 basis
    points) in order to determine a unique interest rate for each
    plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan.

•

Salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience
    and anticipated future management actions. The salary increase
    assumption applies to the Canadian plans and portions of the
    Hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans, as benefits under
    these plans are not frozen.



•

In determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets we
    applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the
    historical long-term compound growth rate of the plan portfolio
    would predict the future returns of similar investments, and the
    utilization of forward looking assumptions.

•

Retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while
    standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality.

Trademarks
    and Other Identifiable Intangibles

Trademarks and computer software are our primary identifiable
    intangible assets. We amortize identifiable intangibles with
    finite lives, and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles
    with indefinite lives. We base the estimated useful life of an
    identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors,
    including the effects of demand, competition, expected changes
    in distribution channels and the level of maintenance
    expenditures required to obtain future cash flows. As of
    December 29, 2007, the net book value of trademarks and
    other identifiable intangible assets was $151 million, of
    which we are amortizing the entire balance. We anticipate that
    our amortization expense for 2008 will be $10 million.

We evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to
    amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used
    to evaluate asset amortization described below under
    “— Depreciation and Impairment of Property, Plant
    and Equipment.” We assess identifiable intangible assets
    not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and
    more often as triggering events occur. In order to determine the
    impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to
    amortization, we compare the fair value of the intangible asset
    to its carrying amount. We recognize an impairment loss for the
    amount by which an identifiable intangible asset’s carrying
    value exceeds its fair value.

We measure a trademark’s fair value using the royalty saved
    method. We determine the royalty saved method by evaluating
    various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows,
    including operating results, business plans, and present value
    techniques. The rates we use to discount cash flows are based on
    interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time.
    Because there are inherent uncertainties related to these
    factors and our judgment in applying them, the assumptions
    underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner
    that impairment in value may occur in the future. Such
    impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes
    known.

Goodwill

As of December 29, 2007, we had $310 million of
    goodwill. We do not amortize goodwill, but we assess for
    impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events
    occur. During the third quarter of the year ended
    December 29, 2007, we changed the timing of our annual
    goodwill impairment testing to the first day of the third fiscal
    quarter. Prior to year ended December 29, 2007, our policy
    was to perform the test at the end of the second fiscal quarter
    which coincided with Sara Lee’s policy before the spin off.
    The change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date was
    made following the change in our fiscal year-end from the
    Saturday closest to June 30 to the Saturday closest to December
    31 and results in the testing continuing to be performed in the
    middle of our fiscal year. In addition, this change in
    accounting principle better aligns the annual goodwill
    impairment test with the timing of our annual long range
    planning cycle. The change in accounting principle does not
    delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. Accordingly, we
    believe that the change in accounting principle described above
    is preferable under the circumstances.

In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we estimate the
    fair value of our reporting units. We have determined that our
    reporting units are at the operating segment level. We rely on a
    number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting
    units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated
    future cash flows, including operating results, business plans,
    and present value techniques. As discussed above under
    “Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangibles,” there
    are inherent uncertainties related to these factors, and our
    judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the
    impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment
    in value may occur in the future. Such impairment will be
    recognized in the period in which it becomes known.



We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step
    process based on an evaluation of reporting units. The first
    step involves a comparison of a reporting unit’s fair value
    to its carrying value. In the second step, if the reporting
    unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, we compare
    the goodwill’s implied fair value and its carrying value.
    If the goodwill’s carrying value exceeds its implied fair
    value, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to
    such excess.

Depreciation
    and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment

We state property, plant and equipment at its historical cost,
    and we compute depreciation using the straight-line method over
    the asset’s life. We estimate an asset’s life based on
    historical experience, manufacturers’ estimates,
    engineering or appraisal evaluations, our future business plans
    and the period over which the asset will economically benefit
    us, which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life.
    Our policies require that we periodically review our
    assets’ remaining depreciable lives based upon actual
    experience and expected future utilization. A change in the
    depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate
    and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period
    of change and future periods. Based upon current levels of
    depreciation, the average remaining depreciable life of our net
    property other than land is five years.

We test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in
    business climate, several periods of operating or cash flow
    losses, forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation
    that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end
    of its useful life. We evaluate an asset’s recoverability
    by comparing the asset or asset group’s net carrying amount
    to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset
    or asset group will generate. If we determine that an asset is
    not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount
    by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated
    fair value.

When we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use,
    we depreciate the asset’s adjusted carrying amount over its
    remaining useful life. We do not restore previously recognized
    impairment losses if circumstances change.

Insurance
    Reserves

We maintain insurance coverage for property, workers’
    compensation and other casualty programs. We are responsible for
    losses up to certain limits and are required to estimate a
    liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate
    losses below those limits. This liability is based on
    management’s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred
    to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance
    sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is
    based on a number of assumptions and factors, including
    historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic
    conditions. If actual trends differ from the estimates, the
    financial results could be impacted.

Assets
    and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions using the purchase method,
    which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business
    to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated
    fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize the excess of
    an acquired business’s cost over the fair value of acquired
    assets and liabilities as goodwill as discussed below under
    “Goodwill.” We use a variety of information sources to
    determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. We
    generally use third-party appraisers to determine the fair value
    and lives of property and identifiable intangibles, consulting
    actuaries to determine the fair value of obligations associated
    with defined benefit pension plans, and legal counsel to assess
    obligations associated with legal and environmental claims.



Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Fair
    Value Measurements

The FASB has issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
    Measurements, or “SFAS 157,” which provides
    guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities.
    The standard also responds to investors’ requests for more
    information about (1) the extent to which companies measure
    assets and liabilities at fair value, (2) the information
    used to measure fair value, and (3) the effect that
    fair-value measurements have on earnings. SFAS 157 will
    apply whenever another standard requires (or permits) assets or
    liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not
    expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances.
    SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
    periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating
    the impact, if any, of SFAS 157 on our results of
    operations and financial position.

Fair
    Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115 (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits
    companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value and establishes
    presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
    comparisons between companies that choose different measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The
    provisions of SFAS 159 become effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently
    evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 will have on
    our results of operations and financial position.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141R”). The objective of SFAS 141 is
    to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and
    comparability of the information that a company provides in its
    financial reports about a business combination and its effects.
    Under SFAS 141R, a company is required to recognize the
    assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies,
    contingent consideration measured at their fair value at the
    acquisition date. It further required that research and
    development assets acquired in a business combination that have
    no alternative future use to be measured at their
    acquisition-date fair value and then immediately charged to
    expense, and that acquisition-related costs are to be recognized
    separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred. Among
    other changes, this statement also required that “negative
    goodwill” be recognized in earnings as a gain attributable
    to the acquisition, and any deferred tax benefits resulting from
    a business combination are recognized in income from continuing
    operations in the period of the combination. SFAS 141R is
    effective for business combinations for which the acquisition
    date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting
    period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). The objective of this Statement is
    to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the
    financial information that a company provides in its
    consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 requires a
    company to clearly identify and present ownership interests in
    subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the
    consolidated financial statements within the equity section but
    separate from the company’s equity. It also requires the
    amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and
    to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and
    presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income;
    changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as
    equity transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated,
    any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former
    subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the
    subsidiary be measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective
    for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
    beginning on or after



December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact
    that SFAS 160 will have on our results of operations and
    financial position.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange
    rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our risk management
    control system uses analytical techniques including market
    value, sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk

We sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated
    in U.S. dollars; however, we purchase some raw materials,
    pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply
    chain in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign exchange
    rates exists primarily with respect to the Canadian dollar,
    Mexican peso and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. We
    use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge
    material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates.
    A sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the
    effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange
    currencies will have on our forward and option contracts. At
    December 29, 2007, the potential change in fair value of
    foreign currency derivative instruments, assuming a 10% adverse
    change in the underlying currency price, was $4.0 million.

Interest
    Rates

We are required under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the
    Second Lien Credit Facility to hedge a portion of our floating
    rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate
    debt issuance. At December 29, 2007, we have outstanding
    hedging arrangements whereby we capped the interest rate on
    $950 million of our floating rate debt at 5.75%. We also
    entered into interest rate swaps tied to the

3-month

and

6-month

LIBOR rates whereby we fixed the interest rate on an aggregate
    of $600 million of our floating rate debt at a blended rate
    of approximately 5.04%. Approximately 67% of our total debt
    outstanding at December 29, 2007 is at a fixed or capped
    rate. After giving effect to these arrangements, a 25-basis
    point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the
    outstanding debt balances as of December 29, 2007 would
    result in a change in annual interest expense of
    $4.3 million.

Commodities

Cotton is the primary raw material we use to manufacture many of
    our products. In addition, fluctuations in crude oil or
    petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials
    we use to manufacture our products, such as chemicals,
    dyestuffs, polyester yarn and foam. We generally purchase our
    raw materials at market prices. In the year ended July 1,
    2006, we started to use commodity financial instruments to hedge
    the price of cotton, for which there is a high correlation
    between costs and the financial instrument. We generally do not
    use commodity financial instruments to hedge other raw material
    commodity prices. At December 29, 2007, the potential
    change in fair value of cotton commodity derivative instruments,
    assuming a 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity price,
    was $1.2 million.

    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting as defined in
    Rules 13a − 15(f) under the Securities and
    Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over financial reporting
    is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
    the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
    Hanesbrands’ system of internal control over financial
    reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of Hanesbrands;
    (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States, and that receipts and
    expenditures of Hanesbrands are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of Hanesbrands;
    and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
    or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of Hanesbrands’ assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of Hanesbrands’
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 29, 2007 based upon criteria for effective
    internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (“COSO”). Based on our evaluation,
    management determined that Hanesbrands’ internal control
    over financial reporting was effective as of December 29,
    2007.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 29, 2007 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in
    Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hanesbrands Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of Hanesbrands Inc. at December 29,
    2007 and December 30, 2006 and the results of its
    operations and its cash flows for the year ended
    December 29, 2007, the six months ended December 30,
    2006, and each of the two years in the period ended July 1,
    2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
    in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
    the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying
    index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
    set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
    consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express opinions on these financial statements, on the
    financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audits (which was
    an integrated audit in 2007). We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Notes 15 and 16 to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it
    accounts for its defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans effective December 30, 2006 and
    changed the measurement date for its plan assets and benefit
    obligations effective December 29, 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

and years ended July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005

Background

On February 10, 2005, Sara Lee Corporation (“Sara
    Lee”) announced an overall transformation plan which
    included spinning off Sara Lee’s apparel business in the
    Americas and Asia (the “Branded Apparel Americas and Asia
    Business”). In connection with the spin off, Sara Lee
    incorporated Hanesbrands Inc., a Maryland corporation
    (“Hanesbrands” and, together with its consolidated
    subsidiaries, the “Company”), to which it would
    transfer the assets and liabilities related to the Branded
    Apparel Americas and Asia Business. On August 31, 2006,
    Sara Lee transferred to the Company substantially all the assets
    and liabilities, at historical cost, comprising the Branded
    Apparel Americas and Asia Business.

On September 5, 2006, as a condition to the distribution to
    Sara Lee’s stockholders of all of the outstanding shares of
    the common stock of Hanesbrands, the Company distributed to Sara
    Lee a cash dividend payment of $1,950,000 and repaid a loan from
    Sara Lee in the amount of $450,000, and Sara Lee distributed to
    its stockholders all of the outstanding shares of
    Hanesbrands’ common stock, with each stockholder receiving
    one share of Hanesbrands’ common stock for each eight
    shares of Sara Lee’s common stock that they held as of the
    August 18, 2006 record date. As a result of such
    distribution, Sara Lee ceased to own any equity interest in the
    Company and the Company became an independent, separately
    traded, publicly held company.

The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated
    operations of Hanesbrands Inc. and its subsidiaries as a
    separate, stand-alone entity subsequent to September 5,
    2006, in addition to the historical operations of the Branded
    Apparel Americas and Asia Business which were operated as part
    of Sara Lee prior to the spin off. Under Sara Lee’s
    ownership, certain of the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia
    Business’s operations were divisions of Sara Lee and not
    separate legal entities, while the Branded Apparel Americas and
    Asia Business’s foreign operations were subsidiaries of
    Sara Lee. A direct ownership relationship did not exist among
    the various units comprising the Branded Apparel Americas and
    Asia Business prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006.
    Subsequent to the spin off on September 5, 2006, the
    Company began accumulating its retained earnings and recognized
    the par value and

paid-in-capital

in connection with the issuance of approximately
    96,306 shares of common stock.

Prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006, the Branded
    Apparel Americas and Asia Business utilized the services of Sara
    Lee for certain functions. These services included providing
    working capital, as well as certain legal, finance, internal
    audit, financial reporting, tax advisory, insurance, global
    information technology, environmental matters and human resource
    services, including various corporate-wide employee benefit
    programs. The cost of these services has been allocated to the
    Company and included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for periods prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006. The
    allocations were determined on the basis which Sara Lee and the
    Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business considered to be
    reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided
    by Sara Lee. A more detailed discussion of the relationship with
    Sara Lee prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006,
    including a description of the costs which have been allocated
    to the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business, as well as
    the method of allocation, is included in Note 19 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management believes the assumptions underlying the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for these periods are reasonable. However,
    the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for the
    periods through September 5, 2006 do not necessarily
    reflect the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business’s
    operations and cash flows in the future or what its results of
    operations and cash flows would have been had the Branded
    Apparel Americas and Asia Business been a stand-alone company
    during the periods presented.

In October 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    a change in the Company’s fiscal year end from the Saturday
    closest to June 30 to the Saturday closest to December 31.
    As a result of this change, the

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    the Company, its controlled subsidiary companies which in
    general are majority owned entities, and the accounts of
    variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is
    deemed the primary beneficiary, as defined by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Interpretation
    No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(FIN 46) and related interpretations. Excluded
    from the accounts of the Company are Sara Lee entities which
    maintained legal ownership of certain of the Company’s
    divisions (Parent Companies) until the spin off on
    September 5, 2006. The results of companies acquired or
    disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition, or
    up to the date of disposal. All intercompany balances and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, which addresses
    consolidation by business enterprises of VIEs that either:
    (1) do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to
    permit the entity to finance its activities

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

without additional subordinated financial support, or
    (2) have equity investors that lack an essential
    characteristic of a controlling financial interest. Throughout
    calendar 2003, the FASB released numerous proposed and final
    FASB Staff Positions (FSPs) regarding FIN 46, which both
    clarified and modified FIN 46’s provisions. In
    December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46

(FIN 46-R),

which replaced FIN 46.

FIN 46-R

retains many of the basic concepts introduced in FIN 46;
    however, it also introduced a new scope exception for certain
    types of entities that qualify as a “business” as
    defined in

FIN 46-R,

revised the method of calculating expected losses and residual
    returns for determination of the primary beneficiary, included
    new guidance for assessing variable interests, and codified
    certain FSPs on FIN 46. The Company adopted the provisions
    of

FIN 46-R

in 2004.

The Company consolidates one VIE, an Israeli manufacturer and
    supplier of yarn. The Company has a 49% ownership interest in
    the Israeli joint venture, however, based upon certain terms of
    the supply contract, the Company has a disproportionate share of
    expected losses and residual returns. The Company continues to
    consolidate this VIE through the year ended December 29,
    2007. The effect of consolidating this VIE was the inclusion of
    $11,903 of total assets and $8,351 of total liabilities at
    December 29, 2007 and $10,632 of total assets and $8,290 of
    total liabilities at December 30, 2006 on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

The Company reported a minority interest of $5,749 and $5,574 in
    the “Other noncurrent liabilities” line of the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 29, 2007 and
    December 30, 2006, respectively.

(b)

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles requires management to make use of estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
    liabilities, certain financial statement disclosures at the date
    of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
    results may vary from these estimates.

(c)

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are
    translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at
    the respective balance sheet dates. Translation adjustments
    resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates are recorded as a
    separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss
    within stockholders’ equity. The Company translates the
    results of operations of its foreign operations at the average
    exchange rates during the respective periods. Gains and losses
    resulting from foreign currency transactions, the amounts of
    which are not material for any of the periods presented, are
    included in the “Selling, general and administrative
    expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

(d)

Sales
    Recognition and Incentives

The Company recognizes revenue when (i) there is persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement, (ii) the sales price is fixed
    or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership
    have been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection
    of the receivable is reasonably assured, which occurs primarily
    upon shipment. The Company records a sales reduction for returns
    and allowances based upon historical return experience. The
    Company earns royalty revenues through license agreements with
    manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate
    certain of the Company’s brands. The Company accrues
    revenue earned under these contracts based upon reported sales
    from the licensee. The Company offers a variety of sales
    incentives to resellers and

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

consumers of its products, and the policies regarding the
    recognition and display of these incentives within the
    Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:

Discounts,
    Coupons, and Rebates

The Company recognizes the cost of these incentives at the later
    of the date at which the related sale is recognized or the date
    at which the incentive is offered. The cost of these incentives
    is estimated using a number of factors, including historical
    utilization and redemption rates. All cash incentives of this
    type are included in the determination of net sales. The Company
    includes incentives offered in the form of free products in the
    determination of cost of sales.

Volume-Based
    Incentives

These incentives typically involve rebates or refunds of cash
    that are redeemable only if the reseller completes a specified
    number of sales transactions. Under these incentive programs,
    the Company estimates the anticipated rebate to be paid and
    allocates a portion of the estimated cost of the rebate to each
    underlying sales transaction with the customer. The Company
    includes these amounts in the determination of net sales.

Cooperative
    Advertising

Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to reimburse the
    reseller for a portion of the costs incurred by the reseller to
    advertise and promote certain of the Company’s products.
    The Company recognizes the cost of cooperative advertising
    programs in the period in which the advertising and promotional
    activity first takes place. For the year ended December 29,
    2007, the Company changed the manner in which it accounted for
    cooperative advertising that resulted in a change in the
    classification from media, advertising and promotion expenses to
    a reduction in sales. This change in classification was made in
    accordance with

EITF 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer
    (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products),

because the estimated fair value of the identifiable benefit
    was no longer obtained beginning in 2007.

Fixtures
    and Racks

Store fixtures and racks are periodically provided to resellers
    to display Company products. The Company expenses the cost of
    these fixtures and racks in the period in which they are
    delivered to the resellers. The Company includes the costs of
    these amounts in the determination of net sales.

(e)

Advertising
    Expense

Advertising costs, which include the development and production
    of advertising materials and the communication of these
    materials through various forms of media, are expensed in the
    period the advertising first takes place. The Company recognized
    advertising expense in the “Selling, general and
    administrative expenses” caption in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income of $188,327 in the year ended
    December 29, 2007, $99,786 in the six months ended
    December 30, 2006, $190,934 in the year ended July 1,
    2006 and $179,980 in the year ended July 2, 2005.

(f)

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Revenue received for shipping and handling costs is included in
    net sales and was $22,751 in the year ended December 29,
    2007, $11,711 in the six months ended December 30, 2006,
    $20,405 in the year ended

July 1, 2006 and $14,504 in the year ended July 2,
    2005. Shipping costs, that comprise payments to third party
    shippers, and handling costs, which consist of warehousing costs
    in the Company’s various distribution facilities, were
    $234,070 in the year ended December 29, 2007, $123,850 in
    the six months ended December 30, 2006, $235,690 in the
    year ended July 1, 2006 and $246,770 in the year ended
    July 2, 2005. The Company recognizes shipping, handling and
    distribution costs in the “Selling, general and
    administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

(g)

Catalog
    Expenses

The Company incurs expenses for printing catalogs for products
    to aid in the Company’s sales efforts. The Company
    initially records these expenses as a prepaid item and charges
    it against selling, general and administrative expenses over
    time as the catalog is used. Expenses are recognized at a rate
    that approximates historical experience with regard to the
    timing and amount of sales attributable to a catalog
    distribution.

(h)

Research
    and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are
    included in the “Selling, general and administrative
    expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.
    Research and development expense was $45,409 in the year ended
    December 29, 2007, $23,460 in the six months ended
    December 30, 2006, $54,571 in the year ended July 1,
    2006 and $51,364 in the year ended July 2, 2005.

(i)

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. Prior to the spin off from Sara Lee on
    September 5, 2006, a significant portion of our cash and
    cash equivalents were in the Company’s bank accounts that
    were part of Sara Lee’s global cash funding system. With
    respect to accounts in the Sara Lee global cash funding system,
    the bank had a right to offset the accounts of the Company
    against the other Sara Lee accounts.

(j)

Accounts
    Receivable Valuation

Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value.
    The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company’s
    best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables
    portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience,
    specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other
    currently available information.

(k)

Inventory
    Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Rebates,
    discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor
    related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in
    the cost of the related inventory item, and are therefore
    reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is
    sold. During the six months ended December 30, 2006, the
    Company elected to convert all inventory valued by the

last-in,

first-out, or “LIFO,” method to the

first-in,

first-out, or “FIFO,” method. In accordance with the
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

(SFAS 154),
    a change from the LIFO to FIFO method of inventory valuation
    constitutes a change in accounting principle. Historically,
    inventory valued under the LIFO method, which was 4% of total
    inventories, would have the same value if measured under the
    FIFO method. Therefore, the conversion has no retrospective
    reporting impact.

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

(l)

Property

Property is stated at historical cost and depreciation expense
    is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
    useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment is
    depreciated over periods ranging from three to 25 years and
    buildings and building improvements over periods of up to
    40 years. A change in the depreciable life is treated as a
    change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation
    is accounted for in the period of change and future periods.
    Additions and improvements that substantially extend the useful
    life of a particular asset and interest costs incurred during
    the construction period of major properties are capitalized.
    Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Upon
    sale or disposition of an asset, the cost and related
    accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts.

Property is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in
    the business climate, several periods of operating or cash flow
    losses, forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation
    that an asset or an asset group will be disposed of before the
    end of its useful life. Recoverability of property is evaluated
    by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset
    group to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be
    generated by the asset or asset group. If these comparisons
    indicate that an asset is not recoverable, the impairment loss
    recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the
    asset exceeds the estimated fair value. When an impairment loss
    is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted
    carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over its
    remaining useful life. Restoration of a previously recognized
    impairment loss is not permitted under U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

(m)

Trademarks
    and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

The primary identifiable intangible assets of the Company are
    trademarks and computer software. Identifiable intangibles with
    finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives are
    not amortized. The estimated useful life of a finite-lived
    intangible asset is based upon a number of factors, including
    the effects of demand, competition, expected changes in
    distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures
    required to obtain future cash flows. Finite-lived trademarks
    are being amortized over periods ranging from five to
    30 years, while computer software is being amortized over
    periods ranging from two to ten years.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs
    under the provisions of AICPA Statement of Position

98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use.

Capitalized computer software
    costs include the actual costs to purchase software from vendors
    and generally include personnel and related costs for employees
    who were directly associated with the enhancement and
    implementation of purchased computer software. Additions to
    computer software are included in purchases of property and
    equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization
    are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that
    used in evaluating elements of property. Identifiable intangible
    assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment
    at least annually and as triggering events occur. The impairment
    test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to
    amortization consists of comparing the fair value of the
    intangible asset to its carrying amount. An impairment loss is
    recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds
    the fair value of the asset. In assessing fair value, management
    relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future
    cash flows including operating results, business plans and
    present value techniques. Rates used to discount cash flows are
    dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point
    in time. There are inherent uncertainties related to these
    factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the
    analysis of intangible asset impairment.

(n)

Goodwill

Goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the
    fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
    business combination. When a business combination is completed,
    the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to the
    reporting unit or units of the Company given responsibility for
    managing, controlling and generating returns on these assets and
    liabilities. The Company has determined that the reporting units
    are at the operating segment level. In many instances, all of
    the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are assigned to a
    single reporting unit and in these cases all of the goodwill is
    assigned to the same reporting unit. In those situations in
    which the acquired assets and liabilities are allocated to more
    than one reporting unit, the goodwill to be assigned to each
    reporting unit is determined in a manner similar to how the
    amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is
    determined.

Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is assessed for
    impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur. The
    first step involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit
    to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting
    unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process
    involves comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value
    of the goodwill of that reporting unit. If the carrying value of
    the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value
    of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount
    equal to such excess.

In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to
    estimate the fair values of the reporting units. In making this
    assessment, management relies on a number of factors to discount
    anticipated future cash flows including operating results,
    business plans and present value techniques. Rates used to
    discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the
    cost of capital at a point in time. There are inherent
    uncertainties related to these factors and management’s
    judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

During the third quarter of the year ended December 29,
    2007, the Company changed the timing of its annual goodwill
    impairment testing to the first day of the third fiscal quarter.
    Prior to the year ended December 29, 2007, the
    Company’s policy was to perform the test at the end of the
    second fiscal quarter which coincided with Sara Lee’s
    policy before the spin off. The change in the annual goodwill
    impairment testing date was made following the change in the
    Company’s fiscal year-end from the Saturday closest to June
    30 to the Saturday closest to December 31 and results in the
    testing continuing to be performed in the middle of the
    Company’s fiscal year. In addition, this change in
    accounting principle better aligns the annual goodwill
    impairment test with the timing of the Company’s annual
    long range planning cycle. The change in accounting principle
    does not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge.
    Accordingly, the Company believes that the change in accounting
    principle described above is preferable under the circumstances.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The employees of the Company participated in the stock-based
    compensation plans of Sara Lee prior to the Company’s spin
    off on September 5, 2006. In connection with the spin off,
    the Company established the Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive
    Plan of 2006, (the “Hanesbrands OIP”) to award stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
    stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash
    to its employees, non-employee directors and employees of its
    subsidiaries to promote the interests of the Company and incent
    performance and retention of employees.

On July 3, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R))
    using the modified prospective method. SFAS No. 123(R)
    requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services
    received in exchange for

awards of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair
    value of those awards. Under the modified prospective method of
    adopting SFAS No. 123(R), the Company recognized
    compensation cost for all share-based payments granted after
    July 3, 2005, plus any awards granted to employees prior to
    July 3, 2005 that remained unvested at that time. Under
    this method of adoption, no restatement of prior periods is
    required. The cumulative effect of adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R) was immaterial in the year ended
    July 1, 2006.

Prior to July 3, 2005, the Company recognized the cost of
    employee services received in exchange for Sara Lee equity-based
    instruments in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” (APB No. 25). APB No. 25 required the
    use of the intrinsic value method, which measures compensation
    cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the
    stock over the amount the employee must pay for the stock.
    Compensation expense for substantially all equity-based awards
    was measured under APB No. 25 on the date the awards were
    granted. Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense has been

Income
    Taxes

For the periods prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006,
    income taxes were prepared on a separate return basis as if the
    Company had been a group of separate legal entities. As a
    result, actual tax transactions that would not have occurred had
    the Company been a separate entity have been eliminated in the
    preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for such
    periods. Until the Company entered into a tax sharing agreement
    with Sara Lee in connection with the spin off, there was no
    formal tax sharing agreement between the Company and Sara Lee.
    The tax sharing agreement allocates responsibilities between the
    Company and Sara Lee for taxes and certain other tax matters.
    Under the tax sharing agreement, Sara Lee generally is liable
    for all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes
    attributable to the Company with respect to taxable periods
    ending on or before September 5, 2006. Sara Lee also is
    liable for income taxes attributable to the Company with respect
    to taxable periods beginning before September 5, 2006 and
    ending after September 5, 2006, but only to the extent
    those taxes are allocable to the portion of the taxable period
    ending on September 5, 2006. The Company is generally
    liable for all other taxes attributable to it. Changes in the
    amounts payable or receivable by the Company under the
    stipulations of this agreement may impact the Company’s
    financial position and cash flows in any period.

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

Within 180 days after Sara Lee files its final consolidated
    tax return for the period that includes September 5, 2006,
    Sara Lee is required to deliver to the Company a computation of
    the amount of deferred taxes attributable to the Company’s
    United States and Canadian operations that would be included on
    the Company’s balance sheet as of September 6, 2006.
    If substituting the amount of deferred taxes as finally
    determined for the amount of estimated deferred taxes that were
    included on that balance sheet at the time of the spin off
    causes a decrease in the net book value reflected on that
    balance sheet, then Sara Lee will be required to pay the Company
    the amount of such decrease. If such substitution causes an
    increase in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet,
    then the Company will be required to pay Sara Lee the amount of
    such increase. For purposes of this computation, the
    Company’s deferred taxes are the amount of deferred tax
    benefits (including deferred tax consequences attributable to
    deductible temporary differences and carryforwards) that would
    be recognized as assets on the Company’s balance sheet
    computed in accordance with GAAP, but without regard to
    valuation allowances, less the amount of deferred tax
    liabilities (including deferred tax consequences attributable to
    deductible temporary differences) that would be recognized as
    liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet computed in
    accordance with GAAP, but without regard to valuation
    allowances. Neither the Company nor Sara Lee will be required to
    make any other payments to the other with respect to deferred
    taxes.

Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of
    temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
    using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences
    are expected to reverse. Given continuing losses in certain
    jurisdictions in which the Company operates on a separate return
    basis, a valuation allowance has been established for the
    deferred tax assets in these specific locations. Net operating
    loss carryforwards, charitable contribution carryforwards and
    capital loss carryforwards have been determined in these
    Consolidated Financial Statements as if the Company had been a
    group of legal entities separate from Sara Lee, which results in
    different carryforward amounts than those shown by Sara Lee. The
    Company periodically estimates the probable tax obligations
    using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed
    judgment. There are inherent uncertainties related to the
    interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which
    the Company transacts business. The judgments and estimates made
    at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax
    audits, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of,
    regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in
    which these events occur, and these adjustments are included in
    the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. If such
    changes take place, there is a risk that the Company’s
    effective tax rate may increase or decrease in any period. In
    July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Interpretation 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), which
    became effective during the year ended December 29, 2007.
    FIN 48 addresses the determination of how tax benefits
    claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be
    recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, a
    company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
    position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
    position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
    authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The
    tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a
    position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a
    greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon
    ultimate resolution. The impact of the reassessment of the
    Company’s tax positions in accordance with FIN 48 did
    not have a material impact on its results of operations,
    financial condition or liquidity.

Financial
    Instruments

The Company uses financial instruments, including forward
    exchange, option and swap contracts, to manage its exposures to
    movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
    commodity prices. The use of these financial instruments
    modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce
    the risk or cost to the

Company. The Company does not use derivatives for trading
    purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative contracts.

The Company formally documents its hedge relationships,
    including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged
    items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies
    for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes
    linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific
    assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted
    transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at
    inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the
    derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
    effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash
    flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative
    ceases to be a highly effective hedge, or if the anticipated
    transaction is no longer likely to occur, the Company
    discontinues hedge accounting, and any deferred gains or losses
    are recorded in the “Selling, general and administrative
    expenses” line of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
    fair value in other assets and other liabilities. The fair value
    is based upon either market quotes for actively traded
    instruments or independent bids for nonexchange traded
    instruments.

On the date the derivative is entered into, the Company
    designates the type of derivative as a fair value hedge, cash
    flow hedge, net investment hedge or a mark to market hedge, and
    accounts for the derivative in accordance with its designation.

Mark to
    Market Hedge

A derivative used as a hedging instrument whose change in fair
    value is recognized to act as an economic hedge against changes
    in the values of the hedged item is designated a mark to market
    hedge. For derivatives designated as mark to market hedges,
    changes in fair value are reported in earnings in the
    “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of
    the Consolidated Statements of Income. Forward exchange
    contracts are recorded as mark to market hedges when the hedged
    item is a recorded asset or liability that is revalued in each
    accounting period, in accordance with SFAS No. 52,

Foreign Currency Translation.

Cash Flow
    Hedge

A hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of
    cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset
    or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge. The effective
    portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative that is
    designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in the
    “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” line of the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. When the hedged item affects the
    income statement, the gain or loss included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) is reported on the same line in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income as the hedged item. In
    addition, both the fair value of changes excluded from the
    Company’s effectiveness assessments and the ineffective
    portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as
    cash flow hedges are reported in the “Selling, general and
    administrative expenses” line in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Business
    Acquisitions

In December 2007, the Company acquired a 900-employee sheer
    hosiery manufacturing operation in Las Lourdes, El Salvador
    for $3,338 in cash and $629 in assumed liabilities, resulting in
    $1,517 of goodwill.

In August 2007, the Company acquired the 1,300-employee textile
    manufacturing operations in San Juan Opico, El Salvador of
    Industrias Duraflex, S.A. de C.V., which had been a supplier to
    the Company since the early 1990s, resulting in $27,293 of
    goodwill.

In November 2006, the Company acquired an Asian sewing
    production facility for $6,666 in cash and the assumption of
    $3,560 of debt. Goodwill of $2,766 was recognized as a result of
    the purchase price exceeding the fair value of the assets and
    liabilities acquired.

In September 2005, the Company acquired a domestic yarn and
    textile production company for $2,436 in cash and the assumption
    of $84,000 of debt. The fair value of the assets acquired, net
    of liabilities assumed, approximated the purchase price and no
    goodwill was recognized as a result of the transaction. In the
    year ended July 2, 2005, purchases from the acquired
    business accounted for approximately 18% of the Company’s
    total cost of sales. Following the acquisition, substantially
    all of the yarn and textiles produced by the acquired business
    have been used in products produced by the Company, and those
    that were not have been sold to third parties.

None of the preceding business acquisitions were determined by
    the Company to be material, individually or in the aggregate, as
    set forth in SFAS No. 141,

(SFAS 141). As a result, the disclosures
    and supplemental pro forma information required by SFAS 141

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Fair
    Value Measurements

The FASB has issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
    Measurements, or “SFAS 157,” which provides
    guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities.
    The standard also responds to investors’ requests for more
    information about (1) the extent to which companies measure
    assets and liabilities at fair value, (2) the information
    used to measure fair value, and (3) the effect that
    fair-value measurements have on earnings. SFAS 157 will
    apply whenever another standard requires (or permits) assets or
    liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not
    expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances.
    SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
    periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact, if any, of SFAS 157 on its results
    of operations and financial position.

Fair
    Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115 (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits
    companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value and establishes
    presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
    comparisons between companies that choose different measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The
    provisions of SFAS 159 become effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently
    evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 will have on
    its results of operations and financial position.

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141R”). The objective of SFAS 141 is
    to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and
    comparability of the information that a company provides in its
    financial reports about a business combination and its effects.
    Under SFAS 141R, a company is required to recognize the
    assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies,
    contingent consideration measured at their fair value at the
    acquisition date. It further required that research and
    development assets acquired in a business combination that have

alternative future use to be measured at their acquisition-date
    fair value and then immediately charged to expense, and that
    acquisition-related costs are to be recognized separately from
    the acquisition and expensed as incurred. Among other changes,
    this statement also required that “negative goodwill”
    be recognized in earnings as a gain attributable to the
    acquisition, and any deferred tax benefits resulting from a
    business combination are recognized in income from continuing
    operations in the period of the combination. SFAS 141R is
    effective for business combinations for which the acquisition
    date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting
    period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). The objective of this Statement is
    to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the
    financial information that a company provides in its
    consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 requires a
    company to clearly identify and present ownership interests in
    subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the
    consolidated financial statements within the equity section but
    separate from the company’s equity. It also requires the
    amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and
    to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and
    presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income;
    changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as
    equity transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated,
    any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former
    subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the
    subsidiary be measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective
    for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact that SFAS 160 will have on
    its results of operations and financial position.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) was computed by
    dividing net income by the number of weighted average shares of
    common stock outstanding during the year ended December 29,
    2007 and the six months ended December 30, 2006. Diluted
    EPS was calculated to give effect to all potentially dilutive
    shares of common stock. The reconciliation of basic to diluted
    weighted average shares for the year ended December 29,
    2007 and the year ended December 30, 2006 is as follows:

Options to purchase 1,163 and 1,832 shares of common stock

    because their effect would be anti-dilutive for the year ended
    December 29, 2007 and the six months ended
    December 30, 2006, respectively.

For the years ended July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005,
    basic and diluted EPS were computed using the number of shares
    of Hanesbrands stock outstanding on September 5, 2006, the
    date on which Hanesbrands common stock was distributed to
    stockholders of Sara Lee in connection with the spin off.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company established the Hanesbrands OIP to award stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
    stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash
    to its employees, non-employee directors and employees of its
    subsidiaries to promote the interests of the Company and incent
    performance and retention of employees.

Stock
    Options

The exercise price of each stock option equals the closing
    market price of Hanesbrands’ stock on the date of grant.
    Options can generally be exercised over a term of between five
    and seven years. Options vest ratably over two to three years
    with the exception of one category of award made in September
    2006 which vested immediately upon grant. The fair value of each
    option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following table
    illustrates the assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model used in determining the fair value of options granted
    during the year ended December 29, 2007 and the six months

The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s
    current intent not to pay dividends. The Company uses the
    volatility of peer companies for a period of time that is
    comparable to the expected life of the option to determine
    volatility assumptions. The Company utilized the simplified
    method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 107 to estimate expected lives for
    options granted. SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 110, which was issued in December 2007,
    amends SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 and gives
    a limited extension on using the simplified method for valuing
    stock option grants to eligible public companies that do not
    have sufficient historical exercise patterns on options granted
    to employees.

Stock
    Unit Awards

Restricted stock units (RSUs) of Hanesbrands’ stock are

    to incent performance and retention over periods ranging from
    one to three years. Upon vesting, the RSUs are converted into
    shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis
    and issued to the grantees. All RSUs which have been granted
    under the Hanesbrands OIP vest solely upon continued future
    service to the Company. The cost of these awards is determined

The total fair value of shares vested during the year ended
    December 29, 2007 was $8,423. Certain participants elected
    to defer receipt of shares earned upon vesting. A total of
    64 shares of common stock are issuable in future years for
    such deferrals.

For all share-based payments under the Hanesbrands OIP, during
    the year ended December 29, 2007 and the six months ended
    December 30, 2006, the Company recognized total
    compensation expense of $33,185 and $10,176 and recognized a
    deferred tax benefit of $12,360 and $3,842, respectively. At
    December 29, 2007, there was $23,904 of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to non-vested stock-based compensation
    arrangements, of which $16,689, $6,623 and $592 is expected to
    be recognized in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. The Company
    satisfies the requirement for common shares for share-based
    payments to employees pursuant to the Hanesbrands OIP by issuing
    newly authorized shares. The Hanesbrands OIP authorized
    13,105 shares for awards of stock options and restricted
    stock units, of which 7,279 were available for future grants.

The employees of the Company participated in the stock-based
    compensation plans of Sara Lee prior to the Company’s spin
    off on September 5, 2006. As a result of the spin off and
    consistent with the terms of the awards under Sara Lee’s
    plans, the outstanding Sara Lee stock options granted expired
    six months after the spin off date. In connection with the spin
    off, vesting for all nonvested service-based Sara Lee RSUs was
    accelerated to the spin off date resulting in the recognition of
    $5,447 of additional compensation expense for the six months
    ended December 30, 2006. An insignificant number of
    performance-based Sara Lee RSUs remained unvested through the
    spin off date.

During April 2007, the Company implemented the Hanesbrands Inc.
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan of 2006 (the “ESPP”),
    which is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal

Senior
    Secured Credit Facility

The Senior Secured Credit Facility initially provided for
    aggregate borrowings of $2,150,000, consisting of: (i) a
    $250,000 Term A loan facility (the “Term A Loan
    Facility”); (ii) a $1,400,000 Term B loan facility
    (the “Term B Loan Facility”); and (iii) a
    $500,000 revolving loan facility (the “Revolving Loan
    Facility”). The Senior Secured Credit Facility is
    guaranteed by substantially all of Hanesbrands’
    U.S. subsidiaries and is secured by equity interests in
    substantially all of Hanesbrands’ direct and indirect
    U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the voting securities of
    certain foreign subsidiaries and substantially all present and
    future assets of Hanesbrands and the guarantors. At the
    Company’s option, borrowings under the Senior Secured
    Credit Facility may be maintained from time to time as
    (a) Base Rate loans, which shall bear interest at the
    higher of (i) 1/2 of 1% in excess of the federal funds rate
    and (ii) the rate published in the Wall Street Journal as
    the “prime rate” (or equivalent), in each case in
    effect from time to time, plus the applicable margin in effect
    from time to time (which is currently 0.50% for the Term A Loan
    Facility and the Revolving Loan Facility and 0.75% for the Term
    B Loan Facility), or (b) LIBOR based loans, which shall
    bear interest at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Senior Secured
    Credit Facility and adjusted for maximum reserves), as
    determined by the administrative agent for the respective
    interest period plus the applicable margin in effect from time
    to time (which is currently 1.50% for the Term A Loan Facility
    and the Revolving Loan Facility and the 1.75% for Term B Loan
    Facility). The final maturity of the Term A Loan Facility is
    September 5, 2012. The Term A Loan Facility amortizes in an
    amount per annum equal to the following: year 1 —
    5.00%; year 2 — 10.00%; year 3 — 15.00%;
    year 4 — 20.00%; year 5 — 25.00%; year
    6 — 25.00%. The final maturity of the Term B Loan
    Facility is September 5, 2013. The Term B Loan Facility is
    payable in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1%
    per annum, with the balance due on the maturity date. The final
    maturity of the Revolving Loan Facility is September 5,
    2011. As of December 29, 2007, the Company had $0
    outstanding under the Revolving Loan Facility, $69,631 of
    standby and trade letters of credit issued and outstanding under
    this facility and $430,369 of borrowing availability. At
    December 29, 2007, the interest rates on the Term A Loan
    Facility and the Term B Loan Facility were 6.37% and 6.78%
    respectively. Outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured
    Credit Facility are prepayable without penalty.

On February 22, 2007, the Company entered into a First
    Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Senior
    Secured Credit Facility. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the
    “applicable margin” with respect to the $1,400,000
    Term B loan facility (“Term B Loan Facility”) that
    comprises a part of the Senior Secured Credit Facility was
    reduced from 2.25% to 1.75% with respect to loans maintained as
    “LIBO Rate loans,” and from 1.25% to 0.75% with
    respect to loans maintained as “Base Rate loans.” The
    First Amendment also provides that in the event that, prior to
    February 22, 2008, the Company: (i) incurs a new
    tranche of replacement loans constituting obligations under the
    Senior Secured Credit Facility having an effective interest rate
    margin less than the applicable margin for loans pursuant to the
    Term B Loan Facility (“Term B Loans”), the proceeds of
    which are used to repay or return, in whole or in part,
    principal of the outstanding Term B Loans, (ii) consummates
    any other amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility that
    reduces the applicable margin for the Term B Loans, or
    (iii) incurs additional Term B Loans having an effective
    interest rate margin less than the applicable margin for Term B
    Loans, the proceeds of which are used in whole or in part to
    prepay or repay outstanding Term B Loans, then in any such case,
    the Company will pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
    ratable account of each Lender with outstanding Term B Loans, a
    fee in an amount equal to 1.0% of the aggregate principal amount
    of all Term B Loans being replaced on such date immediately
    prior to the effectiveness of such transaction.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company to
    comply with customary affirmative, negative, and financial
    covenants, and includes customary events of default. As of
    December 29, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all
    covenants.

Second
    Lien Credit Facility

The Second Lien Credit Facility provides for aggregate
    borrowings of $450,000 by Hanesbrands’ wholly-owned
    subsidiary, HBI Branded Apparel Limited, Inc. The Second Lien
    Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by Hanesbrands and
    each entity guaranteeing the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The
    Second Lien Credit Facility and the guarantees in respect
    thereof are secured on a second-priority basis (subordinate only
    to the Senior Secured Credit Facility and any permitted
    additions thereto or refinancings thereof) by substantially all
    of the assets that secure the Senior Secured Credit Facility.
    Loans under the Second Lien Credit Facility bear interest in the
    same manner as those under the Senior Secured Credit Facility,
    subject to a margin of 2.75% for Base Rate loans and 3.75% for
    LIBOR based loans. The Second Lien Credit Facility matures on
    March 5, 2014, may not be prepaid prior to
    September 5, 2007, and includes premiums for prepayment of
    the loan prior to September 5, 2009 based upon timing of
    the prepayments. The Second Lien Credit Facility will not
    amortize and will be repaid in full on its maturity date. At
    December 29, 2007 the interest rate on the Second Lien
    Credit Facility was 8.82%. The Second Lien Credit Facility
    requires the Company to comply with customary affirmative,
    negative, and financial covenants, and includes customary events
    of default. As of December 29, 2007, the Company was in
    compliance with all covenants.

Floating
    Rate Senior Notes

On December 14, 2006, the Company issued $500,000 aggregate
    principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014. The
    Floating Rate Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations that
    rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s
    existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. The Floating
    Rate Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate, reset
    semi-annually, equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or
    LIBOR, plus 3.375%. Interest is payable on the Floating Rate
    Senior Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning
    on June 15, 2007. The Floating Rate Senior Notes will
    mature on December 15, 2014. The net proceeds from the sale
    of the Floating Rate Senior Notes were approximately $492,000.
    These proceeds, together with working capital, were used to
    repay in full the $500,000 outstanding under the Bridge Loan
    Facility. The Floating Rate Senior Notes are guaranteed by
    substantially all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries.
    The Floating Rate Senior Notes are redeemable on or after
    December 15, 2008, subject to premiums based upon timing of
    the prepayments.

Accounts
    Receivable Securitization

On November 27, 2007, the Company entered into the
    Receivables Facility, which provides for up to $250,000 in
    funding accounted for as a secured borrowing, limited to the
    availability of eligible receivables, and is secured by certain
    domestic trade receivables. The Receivables Facility will
    terminate on November 27, 2010. Under the terms of the
    Receivables Facility, the company sells, on a revolving basis,
    certain domestic trade receivables to HBI Receivables LLC
    (“Receivables LLC”), a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote
    subsidiary that in turn uses the trade receivables to secure the
    borrowings, which are funded through conduits that issue
    commercial paper in the short-term market and are not affiliated
    with the Company or through committed bank purchasers if the
    conduits fail to fund. The assets and liabilities of Receivables
    LLC are fully reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and
    the securitization is treated as a secured borrowing for
    accounting purposes. The borrowings under the Receivables
    Facility remain outstanding throughout the term of the

agreement subject to the Company maintaining sufficient eligible
    receivables, by continuing to sell trade receivables to
    Receivables LLC, unless an event of default occurs.

Availability of funding under the facility depends primarily
    upon the eligible outstanding receivables balance. As of
    December 29, 2007, the Company had $250,000 outstanding
    under the Receivables Facility. The outstanding balance under
    the Receivables Facility is reported on the Company’s
    Consolidated Balance Sheet in long-term debt based on the
    three-year term of the agreement and the fact that remittances
    on the receivables do not automatically reduce the outstanding
    borrowings. All of the proceeds from the Receivables Facility
    were used to make a prepayment of principal under the Senior
    Secured Credit Facility. Unless the conduits fail to fund, the
    yield on the commercial paper, which is the conduits’ cost
    to issue the commercial paper plus certain dealer fees, is
    considered a financing cost and is included in interest expense
    on the Consolidated Statement of Income. If the conduits fail to
    fund, the Receivables Facility would be funded through committed
    bank purchasers, and the interest rate payable at the
    Company’s option at the rate announced from time to time by
    JPMorgan as its prime rate or at the LIBO Rate (as defined in
    the Receivables Facility) plus the applicable margin in effect
    from time to time. The average blended rate utilized for the
    period from November 27, 2007 through December 29,
    2007 was 5.93%.

The total amount of receivables used as collateral for the
    credit facility was $495,245 at December 29, 2007 and is
    reported on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in
    trade accounts receivables less allowances.

Bridge
    Loan Facility

Prior to its repayment in full, the Bridge Loan Facility
    provided for a borrowing of $500,000 and was unconditionally
    guaranteed by each entity guaranteeing the Senior Secured Credit
    Facility. The Bridge Loan Facility was unsecured and was
    scheduled to mature on September 5, 2007. If the Bridge
    Loan Facility had not been repaid prior to or at maturity, the
    outstanding principal amount of the facility was to roll over
    into a rollover loan in the same amount that was to mature on
    September 5, 2014. Lenders that extended rollover loans to
    the Company would have been entitled to request that the Company
    issue “exchange notes” to them in exchange for the
    rollover loans, and also to request that the Company register
    such notes upon request. All amounts outstanding were repaid
    through the issuance of Floating Rate Senior Notes.

Future principal payments for all of the facilities described
    above are as follows: $0 due in 2008, $0 due in 2009, $282,750
    due in 2010, $46,875 due in 2011, $59,375 due in 2012 and
    $1,926,250 thereafter. Reflected in these future principal
    payments were prepayments of $425,000 and $100,000 made during
    the year ended December 29, 2007 and six months ended
    December 30, 2006, respectively. The prepayments relieved
    any requirement for the Company to make mandatory payments on
    the Term A and Term B Loan Facilities through 2009.

The Company incurred $3,266 in debt issuance costs in connection
    with entering into the First Amendment and the Receivables
    Facility during the year ended December 29, 2007 and
    $50,248 in debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance
    of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Second Lien Facility,
    Bridge Loan Facility and the Floating Rate Senior Notes during
    the six months ended December 30, 2006. Debt issuance costs
    are amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of
    the debt instruments, which range from five to eight years. As
    of December 29, 2007, the net carrying value was $32,070
    which is included in other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet. The Company’s debt issuance cost
    amortization was $6,475 and $2,279 for the year ended
    December 29, 2007 and six months ended December 30,
    2006, respectively.

The Company recognized $5,235 of losses on early extinguishment

    During the six months ended December 30, 2006, the Company

    which is comprised of a $6,125 loss for unamortized debt
    issuance costs on the Bridge Loan Facility in connection with

    related to unamortized debt issuance costs on the Senior Secured
    Credit Facility for the prepayment of $100,000 of principal in
    December 2006. As discussed above, the proceeds from the
    issuance of the Floating Rate Senior Notes were used to repay
    the entire outstanding principal of the Bridge Loan Facility.

    transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
    sources. Net income and other comprehensive income, including
    foreign currency translation adjustments, minimum pension
    liabilities (for periods prior to adoption of SFAS 158),
    all unrecognized prior service costs and net loss or gain
    arising during the period (for periods after adoption of
    SFAS 158) and unrealized gains and losses on
    qualifying cash flow hedges, shall be reported, net of their
    related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income. The

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Company is a party to various pending legal proceedings,
    claims and environmental actions by government agencies. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies

, the Company records a provision with respect
    to a claim, suit, investigation, or proceeding when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can reasonably be estimated. Any provisions are
    reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the
    impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and
    other information pertinent to the particular matter. The
    recorded liabilities for these items were not material to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in any of the
    years presented. Although the outcome of such items cannot be
    determined with certainty, the Company’s legal counsel and
    management are of the opinion that the final outcome of these
    matters will not have a material adverse impact on the
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    liquidity.

License
    Agreements

The Company is party to several royalty-bearing license
    agreements for use of third-party trademarks in certain of their
    products. The license agreements typically require a minimum
    guarantee to be paid either at the commencement of the
    agreement, by a designated date during the term of the agreement
    or by the end of the agreement period. When payments are made in
    advance of when they are due, the Company records a

prepayment and amortizes the expense in the “Cost of
    sales” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income
    uniformly over the guaranteed period. For guarantees required to
    be paid at the completion of the agreement, royalties are
    expensed through “Cost of sales” as the related sales
    are made. Management has reviewed all license agreements and
    concluded that these guarantees do not fall under Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards Interpretation No. 45

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
    Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
    Others

, and accordingly, there are no liabilities recorded
    at inception of the agreements.

For the year ended December 29, 2007, the six months ended
    December 30, 2006 and the years ended July 1, 2006 and
    July 2, 2005, the Company incurred royalty expense of
    approximately $11,583, $16,401, $12,554 and $10,571,
    respectively. During the six months ended December 30,
    2006, the Company incurred expense of $9,675 in connection with
    the buy out of a license agreement and the settlement of certain
    contractual terms relating to another license agreement. The
    $9,675 was recorded in the “Selling, general and
    administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statement
    of Income.

Minimum amounts due under the license agreements are
    approximately $8,012 in 2008, $7,001 in 2009, $7,017 in 2010,
    $1,291 in 2011 and $60 in 2012. In addition to the minimum
    guaranteed amounts under license agreements, in the year ended
    December 29, 2007 the Company entered into a partnership
    agreement which included a minimum fee of $6,300 for each year
    from 2008 through 2017.

    Rate Derivatives

In connection with the spin off from Sara Lee on
    September 5, 2006, the Company incurred debt of $2,600,000
    plus an unfunded revolver with capacity of $500,000, all of
    which bears interest at floating rates. During the year ended
    December 29, 2007 and the six months ended
    December 30, 2006, the Company has executed certain
    interest rate cash flow hedges in the form of swaps and caps in
    order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to variability in
    cash flows for the future interest payments on a designated
    portion of borrowings.

The Company records gains and losses on these derivative
    instruments using hedge accounting. Under this accounting
    method, gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other
    comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction impacts the
    Company’s earnings. However, on a quarterly basis hedge
    ineffectiveness will be measured and any resulting
    ineffectiveness will be recorded as gains or losses in the
    respective measurement period.

Foreign
    Currency Derivatives

The Company uses forward exchange and option contracts to reduce
    the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short-term
    foreign currency-denominated transactions, foreign
    currency-denominated investments, other known foreign currency
    exposures and to reduce the effect of fluctuating commodity
    prices on raw materials purchased for production. Gains and
    losses on these contracts are intended to offset losses and
    gains on the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce the
    earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency
    exchange rates and fluctuating commodity prices.

Historically, the principal currencies hedged by the Company
    include the European euro, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and
    Japanese yen. The following table summarizes by major currency
    the contractual amounts of the Company’s foreign exchange
    forward contracts in U.S. dollars. The bought amounts
    represent the net U.S. dollar equivalent of
    commitments to purchase foreign currencies, and the sold amounts
    represent the net U.S. dollar equivalent of
    commitments to sell foreign currencies. The foreign currency
    amounts have been translated into a U.S. dollar equivalent
    value using the exchange rate at the reporting date. Forward
    exchange contracts mature on the anticipated cash requirement
    date of the hedged transaction, generally within one year. There
    were no open foreign exchange forward contracts at
    December 30, 2006.

Commodity
    Derivatives

Cotton is the primary raw material the Company uses to
    manufacture many of its products and is purchased at market
    prices. In the year ended July 1, 2006, the Company started
    to use commodity financial instruments to hedge the price of
    cotton, for which there is a high correlation between the hedged
    item and the hedged instrument. There were no amounts
    outstanding under cotton futures contracts at December 29,
    2007 and December 30, 2006. The notional amounts
    outstanding under the options contracts were 41 and 108 bales of
    cotton at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006,

The Company expects to reclassify into earnings during the next

    transactions are realized. During the year ended
    December 29, 2007 and the six months ended
    December 30, 2006 and the years ended July 1, 2006 and
    July 2, 2005, the Company recognized income (expense) of
    $80, $0, $0, and $(554), respectively, for hedge ineffectiveness
    related to cash flow hedges. Amounts reported for hedge
    ineffectiveness are not included in accumulated other

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans

During the year ended December 29, 2007, the Company
    completed the separation of its pension plan assets and
    liabilities from those of Sara Lee in accordance with
    governmental regulations, which resulted in a higher total
    amount of pension plan assets being transferred to the Company
    than originally was estimated prior to the spin off. Prior to
    spin off, the fair value of plan assets included in the annual
    valuations represented a best estimate based upon a percentage
    allocation of total assets of the Sara Lee trust. The separation
    resulted in a reduction to pension liabilities of approximately
    $74,000 with a corresponding credit to additional paid-in
    capital and resulted in a decrease of approximately $6,000 to
    pension expense for the year ended December 29, 2007.

Effective as of January 1, 2006, the Company created the
    Hanesbrands Inc. Pension and Retirement Plan (the
    “Hanesbrands Pension Plan”), a new frozen defined
    benefit plan to receive assets and liabilities accrued under the
    Sara Lee Pension Plan that are attributable to current and
    former Company employees. In connection with the spin off on
    September 5, 2006, the Company assumed Sara Lee’s
    obligations under the Sara Lee Corporation Consolidated Pension
    and Retirement Plan, the Sara Lee Supplemental Executive
    Retirement Plan, the Sara Lee Canada Pension Plans and certain
    other plans that related to the Company’s current and
    former employees and assumed other Sara Lee retirement plans
    covering only Company employees. Prior to the spin off the
    obligations were not included in the Company’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements. The Company also assumed two
    noncontributory defined benefit plans, the Playtex Apparel, Inc.
    Pension Plan (the “Playtex Plan”) and the National
    Textiles, L.L.C. Pension Plan (the “National Textiles
    Plan”). The obligations and costs related to all of these
    plans are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements as of December 29, 2007 and December 30,
    2006.

On September 29, 2006, SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans” was issued. The objectives of
    SFAS 158 are for an employer to a) recognize the
    overfunded status of a plan as an asset and the underfunded
    status of a plan as a liability in the balance sheet

and to recognize changes in the funded status in comprehensive
    income or loss, and b) measure the funded status of a plan
    as of the date of its balance sheet date. Additional minimum
    pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also
    derecognized upon adoption of the new standard. SFAS 158
    requires initial application of the requirement to recognize the
    funded status of a benefit plan and the related disclosure
    provisions as of the end of fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2006. SFAS 158 requires initial
    application of the requirement to measure plan assets and
    benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date as of the end
    of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company

Prior to the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006,
    employees who met certain eligibility requirements participated
    in defined benefit pension plans sponsored by Sara Lee. These
    defined benefit pension plans included employees from a number
    of domestic Sara Lee business units. All obligations pursuant to
    these plans have historically been obligations of Sara Lee and
    as such, were not included on the Company’s historical
    Consolidated Balance Sheets, prior to September 5, 2006.
    The annual cost of the Sara Lee defined benefit plans was
    allocated to all of the participating businesses based upon a
    specific actuarial computation which was followed consistently.

Measurement
    Date and Assumptions

In accordance with the adoption of SFAS 158 part (b), a
    December 29, 2007 measurement date was used to value plan
    assets and obligations for the Company’s defined benefit
    pension plans for the year ended December 29, 2007. The
    impact of adopting part (b) is an adjustment of $1,058 to
    increase retained earnings, with offsetting decreases to pension
    liability of $1,804 and accumulated other comprehensive income
    of $747 for the year ended December 29, 2007. A measurement
    date of September 30 was used for the six months ended
    December 30, 2006, and a March 31 measurement date for all
    previous periods. The weighted average actuarial assumptions
    used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan
    obligations for the periods presented were as follows:

Postretirement
    Healthcare and Life Insurance Plans

In December 2006, the Company changed the postretirement plan
    benefits to (a) pass along a higher share of retiree
    medical costs to all retirees effective February 1, 2007,
    (b) eliminate company contributions toward premiums for
    retiree medical coverage effective December 1, 2007,
    (c) eliminate retiree medical coverage options for all
    current and future retirees age 65 and older and
    (d) eliminate future postretirement life benefits. Gains
    associated with these plan amendments were amortized throughout
    the year ended December 29, 2007 in anticipation of the
    effective termination of the medical plan on December 1,
    2007. On December 1, 2007 the Company effectively
    terminated all retiree medical coverage. Postretirement benefit
    income of $28,467 was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of
    Income for the six months ended December 30, 2006, which
    represented the unrecognized amounts associated with prior plan
    amendments that were being amortized into income over the
    remaining service period of the participants prior to the
    December 2006 amendments. A gain on curtailment of $32,144 is
    recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year
    ended December 29, 2007, which represents the final
    settlement of the retirement plan.

On September 29, 2006, SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans” was issued. The objectives of
    SFAS 158 are for an employer to a) recognize the
    overfunded status of a plan as an asset and the underfunded
    status of a plan as a liability in the balance sheet and to
    recognize changes in the funded status in comprehensive income
    or loss, and b) measure the funded status of a plan as of
    the date of its balance sheet date. Additional minimum pension
    liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized
    upon adoption of the new standard. SFAS 158 requires
    initial application of the requirement to recognize the funded
    status of a benefit plan and the related disclosure provisions
    as of the end of fiscal years ending after December 15,
    2006. SFAS 158 requires initial application of the
    requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of
    the balance sheet date as of the end of fiscal years ending
    after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted part

Prior to the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006,
    employees who met certain eligibility requirements participated
    in post-retirement healthcare and life insurance sponsored by
    Sara Lee. These plans included employees from a number of
    domestic Sara Lee business units. All obligations pursuant to
    these plans have historically been obligations of Sara Lee and
    as such, were not included on the Company’s historical
    Consolidated Balance Sheets, prior to September 5, 2006.
    The annual cost of the Sara Lee defined benefit plans was
    allocated to all of the participating businesses based upon a
    specific actuarial computation which was followed consistently.
    In connection with the spin off on September 5, 2006, the
    Company assumed Sara Lee’s obligations under the Sara Lee
    postretirement plans related to the Company’s current and
    former employees.

The postretirement plan expense incurred by the Company for
    these postretirement plans is as follows:

    assets and obligations for the Company’s postretirement
    life insurance plans in the current year. The impact of adopting
    part (b) is an adjustment of $131 to increase retained
    earnings, with an offsetting

decrease to postretirement liability at December 29, 2007.
    A September 30, 2006 measurement date was used to value
    plan assets and obligations for the Company’s
    postretirement medical and life insurance plans for the previous
    year. The weighted average actuarial assumptions used in
    measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obligations for
    the plan at the measurement date were as follows: discount rate
    of 6.20% for plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost; and
    long term rate of return on plan assets of 3.70%.

(b)

Contributions
    and Benefit Payments

The Company expects to make a contribution of $525 in 2008.
    Expected benefit payments are as follows: $525 in 2008, $521 in

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of
    December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 was $15,992
    and $14,591 respectively. The net change in the total valuation
    allowance for the year ended December 29, 2007 and the six
    months ended December 30, 2006 was $1,401 and $(32,536)
    respectively.

The valuation allowance relates in part to deferred tax assets
    established under SFAS No. 109 for loss carryforwards
    at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 of $13,137
    and $11,736 respectively, and to foreign goodwill of $2,855 at
    December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006.

Within 180 days after Sara Lee files its final consolidated
    tax return for the period that includes September 5, 2006,
    Sara Lee is required to deliver to the Company a computation of
    the amount of deferred taxes attributable to the Company’s
    United States and Canadian operations that would be included on
    the Company’s balance sheet as of September 6, 2006.
    If substituting the amount of deferred taxes as finally
    determined for the amount of estimated deferred taxes that were
    included on that balance sheet at the time of the spin off
    causes a decrease in the net book value reflected on that
    balance sheet, then Sara Lee will be required to pay the Company
    the amount of such decrease. If such substitution causes an
    increase in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet,
    then the Company will be required to pay Sara Lee the amount of
    such increase. For purposes of this computation, the
    Company’s deferred taxes are the amount of deferred tax
    benefits (including deferred tax consequences attributable to
    deductible temporary differences and carryforwards) that would
    be recognized as assets on the Company’s balance sheet
    computed in accordance with GAAP, but without regard to
    valuation allowances, less the amount of deferred tax
    liabilities (including deferred tax consequences attributable to
    deductible temporary differences) that would be recognized as
    liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet computed in
    accordance with GAAP, but

without regard to valuation allowances. Neither the Company nor
    Sara Lee will be required to make any other payments to the
    other with respect to deferred taxes.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
    management considers whether it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
    dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
    the periods in which those temporary differences become
    deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of
    deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and
    tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon
    the level of historical taxable income and projections for
    future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax
    assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely
    than not the Company will realize the benefits of these
    deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.

At December 29, 2007, the Company has net operating loss
    carryforwards of approximately $55,833 which will expire as
    follows:

At December 29, 2007, applicable U.S. federal income
    taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on
    the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are
    expected to be permanently reinvested. If these earnings had not
    been permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of approximately
    $87,000 would have been recognized in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted FIN 48 in
    the year ended December 29, 2007. As a result of the
    implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no
    adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits
    as of the beginning of 2007. Although it is not reasonably
    possible to estimate the amount by which these unrecognized tax
    benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months
    due to uncertainties regarding the timing of examinations and
    the amount of settlements that may be paid, if any, to tax
    authorities, the Company does not expect unrecognized tax
    benefits to significantly change in the next twelve months. A
    reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

    tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

In addition, a $248,118 valuation allowance existed for capital
    losses resulting from the sale of U.S. apparel capital
    assets in 2001 and 2003. Of these capital losses $224,969
    expired unused at July 1, 2006. During the six months ended
    December 30, 2006, deferred tax assets and the related
    valuation allowance were reduced by $23,149 for the remaining
    capital losses and $9,387 in foreign net operating losses
    retained by Sara Lee.

The Company recognized a $50,000 tax charge related to the
    repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the
    U.S. in 2005. In addition, during 2005 the Company
    recognized a $31,600 tax charge for extraordinary dividends
    associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Act). On
    October 22, 2004, the President of the United States signed
    the Act which created a temporary incentive for
    U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned
    abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for
    certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations.

Stockholders’
    Equity

The Company is authorized to issue up to 500,000 shares of
    common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and up to
    50,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
    share, and permits the Company’s board of directors,
    without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the
    aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of
    stock of any class or series that the Company is authorized to
    issue. At December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006,
    95,232 and 96,312 shares, respectively, of common stock
    were issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock
    were issued or outstanding. Included within the
    50,000 shares of preferred stock, 500 shares are
    designated Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series A
    (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) and reserved for
    issuance upon the exercise of rights under the rights agreement
    described below.

Preferred
    Stock Purchase Rights

Pursuant to a stockholder rights agreement entered into by the
    Company prior to the spin off, one preferred stock purchase
    right will be distributed with and attached to each share of the
    Company’s common stock. Each right will entitle its holder,
    under the circumstances described below, to purchase from the
    Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Series A
    Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $75 per right.
    Initially, the rights will be associated with the Company’s
    common stock, and will be transferable with and only with the
    transfer of the underlying share of common stock. Until a right
    is exercised, its holder, as such, will have no rights as a
    stockholder with respect to such rights, including, without
    limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

The rights will become exercisable and separately certificated
    only upon the rights distribution date, which will occur upon
    the earlier of: (i) ten days following a public
    announcement by the Company that a person or group (an
    “acquiring person”) has acquired, or obtained the
    right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of its
    outstanding shares of common stock (the date of the announcement
    being the “stock acquisition date”); or (ii) ten
    business days (or later if so determined by our board of
    directors) following the commencement of or public disclosure of
    an intention to commence a tender offer or exchange offer by a
    person if, after acquiring the maximum number of securities
    sought pursuant to such offer, such person, or any affiliate or
    associate of such person, would acquire, or obtain the right to
    acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding
    shares of the Company’s common stock.

Upon the Company’s public announcement that a person or
    group has become an acquiring person, each holder of a right
    (other than any acquiring person and certain related parties,
    whose rights will have automatically become null and void) will
    have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock with a
    value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. In the
    event of certain business combinations, each holder of a right
    (except rights which previously have been voided as described
    above) will have the right to receive, upon exercise, common
    stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times
    the exercise price of the right.

The Company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at
    a price of $0.001 per right (subject to adjustment and payable
    in cash, common stock or other consideration deemed appropriate
    by the board of directors) at any time prior to the earlier of
    the stock acquisition date and the rights expiration date.
    Immediately upon the action of the board of directors
    authorizing any redemption, the rights will terminate and the
    holders of rights will only be entitled to receive the
    redemption price. At any time after a person becomes an
    acquiring person and prior to the earlier of (i) the time
    any person, together with all affiliates and associates, becomes
    the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock and (ii) the occurrence of a
    business combination, the board of directors may cause the
    Company to exchange for all or part of the then-outstanding and
    exercisable rights shares of its common stock at an exchange
    ratio of one common share per right, adjusted to reflect any
    stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction.

    September 5, 2006, Sara Lee ceased to be a related party to
    the Company. The Company paid a dividend to Sara Lee of
    $1,950,000 and repaid a loan in the amount of $450,000 which is
    reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’
    Equity. An additional payment of approximately $26,306 was paid
    to Sara Lee during the six months ended December 30, 2006
    in order to satisfy all outstanding payables from the Company to
    Sara Lee and Sara Lee subsidiaries.

Prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006, the Company
    participated in a number of Sara Lee administered programs such
    as cash funding systems, insurance programs, employee benefit
    programs and workers’ compensation programs. In connection
    with the spin off from Sara Lee, the Company assumed $299,000 in
    unfunded employee benefit liabilities for pension,
    postretirement and other retirement benefit qualified and
    nonqualified plans, and $37,554 of liabilities in connection
    with property insurance, workers’ compensation, and other
    programs.

Included in the historical information are costs of certain
    services such as business insurance, medical insurance, and
    employee benefit plans and allocations for certain centralized
    administration costs for treasury, real estate, accounting,
    auditing, tax, risk management, human resources and benefits
    administration. Centralized administration costs were allocated
    to the Company based upon a proportional cost allocation method.
    These allocated costs are included in the “Selling, general
    and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated
    Statement of Income. For the year ended December 29, 2007
    and six months ended December 30, 2006, the total amount
    allocated for centralized administration costs by Sara Lee was
    $0.

In connection with the spin off, the Company entered into the
    following agreements with Sara Lee:

•

Master Separation Agreement.

This agreement
    governs the contribution of Sara Lee’s branded apparel
    Americas/Asia business to the Company, the subsequent
    distribution of shares of Hanesbrands’ common stock to Sara
    Lee stockholders and other matters related to Sara Lee’s
    relationship with the Company. To effect the contribution, Sara
    Lee agreed to transfer all of the assets of the branded apparel
    Americas/Asia business to the Company and the Company agreed to
    assume, perform and fulfill all of the

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

liabilities of the branded apparel Americas/Asia division in
    accordance with their respective terms, except for certain
    liabilities to be retained by Sara Lee.

•

Tax Sharing Agreement.

This agreement governs
    the allocation of U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign
    tax liability between the Company and Sara Lee, provides for
    restrictions and indemnities in connection with the tax
    treatment of the distribution, and addresses other tax-related
    matters. This agreement also provides that the Company is liable
    for taxes incurred by Sara Lee that arise as a result of the
    Company taking or failing to take certain actions that result in
    the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a tax-free
    distribution under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the
    Internal Revenue Code. The Company therefore has generally
    agreed that, among other things, it will not take any actions
    that would result in any tax being imposed on the spin off.

•

Employee Matters Agreement.

This agreement
    allocates responsibility for employee benefit matters on the
    date of and after the spin off, including the treatment of
    existing welfare benefit plans, savings plans, equity-based
    plans and deferred compensation plans as well as the
    Company’s establishment of new plans.

•

Master Transition Services Agreement.

Under
    this agreement, the Company and Sara Lee agreed to provide each
    other, for varying periods of time, with specified support
    services related to among others, human resources and financial
    shared services, tax-shared services and information technology
    services. Each of these services is provided for a fee, which
    differs depending upon the service.

•

Real Estate Matters Agreement.

This agreement
    governs the manner in which Sara Lee will transfer to or share
    with the Company various leased and owned properties associated
    with the branded apparel business.

•

Indemnification and Insurance Matters
    Agreement.

This agreement provides general
    indemnification provisions pursuant to which the Company and
    Sara Lee have agreed to indemnify each other and their
    respective affiliates, agents, successors and assigns from
    certain liabilities. This agreement also contains provisions
    governing the recovery by and payment to the Company of
    insurance proceeds related to its business and arising on or
    prior to the date of the distribution and its insurance coverage.

•

Intellectual Property Matters Agreement.

This
    agreement provides for the license by Sara Lee to the Company of
    certain software, and governs the wind-down of the
    Company’s use of certain of Sara Lee’s trademarks
    (other than those being transferred to the Company in connection
    with the spin off).

The following is a discussion of the relationship with Sara Lee,
    the services provided and how they have been accounted for in
    the Company’s financial statements.

(a)

Allocation
    of Corporate Costs

The costs of certain services that were provided by Sara Lee to
    the Company during the periods presented have been reflected in
    these financial statements, including charges for services such
    as business insurance, medical insurance and employee benefit
    plans and allocations for certain centralized administration
    costs for treasury, real estate, accounting, auditing, tax, risk
    management, human resources and benefits administration. These
    allocations of centralized administration costs were determined
    using a proportional cost allocation method on bases that the
    Company and Sara Lee considered to be reasonable, including
    relevant operating profit, fixed assets, sales, and payroll.
    Allocated costs are included in the “Selling, general and
    administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. The total amount allocated for centralized
    administration costs by Sara Lee in the year ended
    December 29, 2007, six months ended December 30, 2006

    December 30, 2006

and years ended July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

and the years ended July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005 was
    $0, $0, $37,478 and $34,213, respectively. Beginning with the
    six months ended December 30, 2006, there were no costs
    allocated as the Company’s infrastructure was in place and
    did not significantly benefit from these services from Sara Lee.
    These costs represent management’s reasonable allocation of
    the costs incurred. However, these amounts may not be
    representative of the costs necessary for the Company to operate
    as a separate standalone company. The “Net transactions
    with parent companies” line item in the Consolidated
    Statements of Parent Companies’ Equity primarily reflects
    dividends paid to parent companies and costs paid by Sara Lee on
    behalf of the Company.

(b)

Other
    Transactions with Sara Lee Related Entities

During all periods presented prior to the spin off on
    September 5, 2006, the Company’s entities engaged in
    certain transactions with other Sara Lee businesses that are not
    part of the Company, which included the purchase and sale of
    certain inventory, the exchange of services, and royalty
    arrangements involving the use of trademarks or other
    intangibles.

Transactions with related entities are summarized in the table

Consolidating
    Financial Information

In accordance with the indenture governing the Company’s
    $500,000 Floating Rate Senior Notes issued on December 14,
    2006, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have guaranteed
    the Company’s obligations under the Floating Rate Senior
    Notes. The following presents the condensed consolidating
    financial information separately for:

(i) Parent Company, the issuer of the guaranteed
    obligations. Parent Company includes Hanesbrands Inc. and its
    100% owned operating divisions (divisional entities) which are
    not legal entities, and excludes its subsidiaries which are
    legal entities;

(ii) For period prior to the spin off from Sara Lee,
    divisional entities, on a combined basis, representing operating
    divisions (not legal entities) 100% owned by Sara Lee

Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Year ended December 29, 2007, six months ended
    December 30, 2006

and years ended July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

(v) Consolidating entries and eliminations representing
    adjustments to (a) eliminate intercompany transactions
    between or among Hanesbrands, the guarantor subsidiaries and the
    non-guarantor subsidiaries, (b) eliminate intercompany
    profit in inventory, (c) eliminate the investments in our
    subsidiaries and (d) record consolidating entries; and

(vi) Parent Company, on a consolidated basis.

As described in Note 1, a separate legal entity did not
    exist for Hanesbrands Inc. prior to the spin off from Sara Lee
    because a direct ownership relationship did not exist among the
    various units comprising the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia
    Business. In connection with the spin off from Sara Lee, each
    guarantor subsidiary became a 100% owned direct or indirect
    subsidiary of Hanesbrands Inc. as of September 5, 2006.
    Therefore, a parent company entity is not presented for periods
    prior to the spin-off, but divisional entities of Sara Lee are
    presented.

The Floating Rate Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally
    guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each guarantor
    subsidiary. Each entity in the consolidating financial
    information follows the same accounting policies as described in
    the consolidated financial statements, except for the use by the
    Parent Company and guarantor subsidiaries of the equity method
    of accounting to reflect ownership interests in subsidiaries
    which are eliminated upon consolidation.

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
    to the current year presentation and legal entity structure
    relating to the classification of the investment in subsidiary
    balances and related equity in earnings of subsidiaries. Prior
    period presentation has been revised to combine Parent and
    Divisional Entities columns for periods after the spin off from
    Sara Lee on September 5, 2006.
