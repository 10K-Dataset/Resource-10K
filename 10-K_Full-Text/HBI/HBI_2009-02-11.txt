PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

We are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands, including

Hanes,
Champion, C9 by Champion, Playtex, Bali, L’eggs, Just My Size, barely there

,

Wonderbra, Stedman,
Outer Banks, Zorba, Rinbros

and

Duofold.

We design, manufacture, source and sell a broad range of
apparel essentials such as t-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear, kids’ underwear, casualwear,
activewear, socks and hosiery.

The apparel essentials sector of the apparel industry is characterized by frequently
replenished items, such as t-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear, kids’ underwear, socks and
hosiery. Growth and sales in the apparel essentials industry are not primarily driven by fashion,
in contrast to other areas of the broader apparel industry. We focus on the core attributes of
comfort, fit and value, while remaining current with regard to consumer trends. The majority of our
core styles continue from year to year, with variations only in color, fabric or design details.
Some products, however, such as intimate apparel, activewear and sheer hosiery, do have an emphasis
on style and innovation. We continue to invest in our largest and strongest brands to achieve our
long-term growth goals. In addition to designing and marketing apparel essentials, we have a long
history of operating a global supply chain that incorporates a mix of self-manufacturing,
third-party contractors and third-party sourcing.

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31 and, until it was changed during
2006, ended on the Saturday closest to June 30. We refer to the fiscal year ended January 3, 2009
as the year ended January 3, 2009. A reference to a year ended on another date is to the fiscal
year ended on that date.

Our operations are managed and reported in five operating segments: Innerwear, Outerwear,
International, Hosiery and Other. The following table summarizes our operating segments by
category:

As a result of the February 2006 sale of the European branded apparel business of Sara Lee
Corporation, or “Sara Lee,” we are not permitted to sell this brand in the member states of
the European Union, or the “EU,” several other European countries and South Africa.

Our brands have a strong heritage in the apparel essentials industry. According to The NPD
Group/Consumer Tracking Service, or “NPD,” our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S.
market position by sales value in most product categories in which we compete, for the 12 month
period ended November 30, 2008. In 2008,

Hanes

was number one for the fifth consecutive year on the
Women’s Wear Daily “Top 100 Brands Survey” for



apparel and accessory brands that women know best
and was number one for the fifth consecutive year as the most preferred men’s, women’s and
children’s apparel brand of consumers in Retailing Today magazine’s “Top Brands Study.”
Additionally, we had five of the top ten intimate apparel brands preferred by consumers in the
Retailing Today study —

Hanes, Playtex, Bali, Just My Size

and

L’eggs

.

Our products are sold through multiple distribution channels. During the year ended January 3,
2009, approximately 44% of our net sales were to mass merchants, 18% were to national chains and
department stores, 9% were direct to consumers, 11% were in our International segment and 18% were
to other retail channels such as embellishers, specialty retailers, warehouse clubs and sporting
goods stores. We have strong, long-term relationships with our top customers, including
relationships of more than ten years with each of our top ten customers. The size and operational
scale of the high-volume retailers with which we do business require extensive category and product
knowledge and specialized services regarding the quantity, quality and planning of product orders.
We have organized multifunctional customer management teams, which has allowed us to form strategic
long-term relationships with these customers and efficiently focus resources on category, product
and service expertise. We also have customer-specific programs such as the

C9 by Champion

products
marketed and sold through Target stores.

Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success. Our
design, research and product development teams, in partnership with our marketing teams, drive our
efforts to bring innovations to market. We seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in
the apparel essentials industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our
existing core products in ways that make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs
and industry trends. Examples of our recent innovations include:

One of our key initiatives is to globalize our supply chain by balancing across hemispheres
into “economic” clusters with fewer, larger facilities. During the year ended January 3, 2009, in
furtherance of our efforts to execute our consolidation and globalization strategy, we approved
actions to close 11 manufacturing facilities and three distribution centers and eliminate
approximately 6,800 positions in Mexico, the United States, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador.
The production capacity represented by the manufacturing facilities has been relocated to lower
cost locations in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. The distribution capacity has been
relocated to our West Coast distribution facility in California in order to expand capacity for
goods we source from Asia. In addition, approximately 200 management and administrative positions
were eliminated, with the majority of these positions based in the United States. We also have
recognized accelerated depreciation with respect to owned or leased assets associated with
manufacturing facilities and distribution centers which we closed during 2008 or anticipate closing
in the next several years as part of our consolidation and globalization strategy. The continued
implementation of this strategy, which is designed to improve operating efficiencies and lower
costs, has resulted and is likely to continue to result in significant costs in the short-term and to
generate savings as well as higher inventory levels for the next 12 to 15 months. As further plans
are developed and approved, we expect to recognize additional restructuring costs as we eliminate
duplicative functions within the organization and transition a significant portion of our
manufacturing capacity to lower-cost locations. As a result of this strategy, we expect to incur
approximately $250 million in restructuring and related charges over the three year period
following the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006, approximately half of which is expected
to be noncash. As of January 3, 2009, we have recognized approximately $209 million and announced
approximately $219 million in restructuring and related charges related to this strategy since
September 5, 2006.



We were spun off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006. In connection with the spin off, Sara Lee
contributed its branded apparel Americas and Asia business to us and distributed all of the
outstanding shares of our common stock to its stockholders on a pro rata basis. References in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K to our assets, liabilities, products, businesses or activities of our
business for periods including or prior to the spin off are generally intended to refer to the
historical assets, liabilities, products, businesses or activities of the contributed businesses as
the businesses were conducted as part of Sara Lee and its subsidiaries prior to the spin off.

Our Brands

Our portfolio of leading brands is designed to address the needs and wants of various consumer
segments across a broad range of apparel essentials products. Each of our brands has a particular
consumer positioning that distinguishes it from its competitors and guides its advertising and
product development. We discuss some of our most important brands in more detail below.

Hanes

is the largest and most widely recognized brand in our portfolio. In 2008,

Hanes

was
number one for the fifth consecutive year on the Women’s Wear Daily “Top 100 Brands Survey” for
apparel and accessory brands that women know best and was number one for the fifth consecutive year
as the most preferred men’s, women’s and children’s apparel brand of consumers in Retailing Today
magazine’s “Top Brands Study.” The

Hanes

brand covers all of our product categories, including
men’s underwear, kids’ underwear, bras, panties, socks, t-shirts, fleece and sheer hosiery.

Hanes

stands for outstanding comfort, style and value. According to Millward Brown Market Research,

Hanes

is found in over 85% of the United States households that have purchased men’s or women’s casual
clothing or underwear in the 12-month period ended December 31, 2008.

Champion

is our second-largest brand. Specializing in athletic and other performance apparel,
the

Champion

brand is designed for everyday athletes. We
believe that

Champion

’s combination of
comfort, fit and style provides athletes with mobility, durability and up-to-date styles, all
product qualities that are important in the sale of athletic products. We also distribute products
under the

C9 by Champion

brand exclusively through Target stores.

Playtex

, the third-largest brand within our portfolio, offers a line of bras, panties and
shapewear, including products that offer solutions for hard to fit figures.

Bali

is the
fourth-largest brand within our portfolio.

Bali

offers a range of bras, panties and shapewear sold
in the department store channel. Our brand portfolio also includes the following well-known brands:

L’eggs

,

Just My Size

,

barely there

,

Wonderbra

,

Outer Banks

and

Duofold.

These brands serve to
round out our product offerings, allowing us to give consumers a variety of options to meet their
diverse needs.

Our Segments

Our operations are managed in five operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment
for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Outerwear, International, Hosiery and Other. These
segments are organized principally by product category and geographic location. Management of each
segment is responsible for the operations of these businesses but share a common supply chain and
media and marketing platforms. For more information about our segments, see Note 21 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Innerwear

The Innerwear segment focuses on core apparel essentials, and consists of products such as
women’s intimate apparel, men’s underwear, kids’ underwear, socks, thermals and sleepwear, marketed
under well-known brands that are trusted by consumers. We are an intimate apparel category leader
in the United States with our

Hanes

,

Playtex

,

Bali

,

barely there, Just My Size

,

Wonderbra

and

Duofold

brands. We are also a leading manufacturer and marketer of men’s underwear and kids’
underwear under the

Hanes

,

Champion, C9 by Champion

and

Polo Ralph Lauren

brand names. Our
direct-to-consumer retail operations are included within the Innerwear segment. The retail
operations include our value-based (“outlet”) stores, internet operations and catalogs which sell
products from our portfolio of leading brands. As of January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, we had
213 and 216 outlet stores, respectively. Net sales for the year ended January 3, 2009 from our
Innerwear segment were $2.4 billion, representing approximately 56% of total segment net sales.



Outerwear

We are a leader in the casualwear and activewear markets through our

Hanes

,

Champion

and

Just
My Size

brands, where we offer products such as t-shirts and fleece. Our casualwear lines offer a
range of quality, comfortable clothing for men, women and children marketed under the

Hanes

and

Just My Size

brands. The

Just My Size

brand offers casual apparel designed exclusively to meet the
needs of plus-size women. In addition to activewear for men and women,

Champion

provides uniforms
for athletic programs and includes an apparel program,

C9 by Champion

, at Target stores. We also
license our

Champion

name for collegiate apparel and footwear. We also supply our t-shirts,
sportshirts and fleece products primarily to wholesalers, who then resell to screen printers and
embellishers, through brands such as

Hanes

,

Champion

,

Outer Banks

and

Hanes Beefy-T

. Net sales for
the year ended January 3, 2009 from our Outerwear segment were $1.2 billion, representing
approximately 28% of total segment net sales.

International

International includes products that span across the Innerwear, Outerwear and Hosiery
reportable segments and are marketed primarily under the

Hanes, Wonderbra, Champion, Stedman,
Playtex, Zorba, Rinbros, Kendall, Sol y Oro, Ritmo and Bali

brands. Net sales for the year ended
January 3, 2009 from our International segment were $460 million, representing approximately 11% of
total segment net sales and included sales in Latin America, Asia, Canada and Europe. Canada,
Europe, Japan and Mexico are our largest international markets, and we also have sales offices in
India and China.

Hosiery

We are the leading marketer of women’s sheer hosiery in the United States. We compete in the
hosiery market by striving to offer superior values and executing integrated marketing activities,
as well as focusing on the style of our hosiery products. We market hosiery products under our

L’eggs, Hanes

and

Just My Size

brands. Net sales for the year ended January 3, 2009 from our
Hosiery segment were $228 million, representing approximately 5% of total segment net sales. We
expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the
industry and with shifts in consumer preferences.

Other

Our Other segment consists of sales of nonfinished products such as yarn and certain other
materials in the United States and Latin America that maintain asset utilization at certain
manufacturing facilities and are expected to generate break even margins. Net sales for the year
ended January 3, 2009 in our Other segment were $22 million, representing less than 1% of total
segment net sales. Net sales from our Other segment are expected to continue to decline and to
ultimately become insignificant to us as we complete the implementation of our consolidation and
globalization efforts.

Design, Research and Product Development

At the core of our design, research and product development capabilities is a team of more
than 300 professionals. We have combined our design, research and development teams into an
integrated group for all of our product categories. A facility located in Winston-Salem, North
Carolina, is the center of our research, technical design and product development efforts. We also
employ creative design and product development personnel in our design center in New York City.
During the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, the six months ended December 30,
2006 and the year ended July 1, 2006, we spent approximately $46 million, $45 million, $23 million
and $55 million, respectively, on design, research and product development.

Customers

In the year ended January 3, 2009, approximately 88% of our net sales were to customers in the
United States and approximately 12% were to customers outside the United States. Domestically,
almost 83% of our net sales were wholesale sales to retailers, 9% were direct to consumers and 8%
were wholesale sales to third-party embellishers. We have well-established relationships with some
of the largest apparel retailers in the world. Our



largest customers are Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., or “Wal-Mart,” Target
Corporation, or “Target,” and Kohl’s Corporation, or “Kohl’s,” accounting for 27%, 16% and 6%,
respectively, of our total sales in the year ended January 3, 2009. As is common in the apparel
essentials industry, we generally do not have purchase agreements that obligate our customers,
including Wal-Mart, to purchase our products. However, all of our key customer relationships have
been in place for ten years or more. Wal-Mart and Target are our only customers with sales that
exceed 10% of any individual segment’s sales. In our Innerwear segment, Wal-Mart accounted for 32%
of sales and Target accounted for 13% of sales during the year ended January 3, 2009. In our
Outerwear segment, Target accounted for 30% of sales and Wal-Mart accounted for 21% of sales during
the year ended January 3, 2009.

Due to their size and operational scale, high-volume retailers such as Wal-Mart require
extensive category and product knowledge and specialized services regarding the quantity, quality
and timing of product orders. We have organized multifunctional customer management teams, which
has allowed us to form strategic long-term relationships with these customers and efficiently focus
resources on category, product and service expertise.

Smaller regional customers attracted to our leading brands and quality products also represent
an important component of our distribution. Our organizational model provides for an efficient use
of resources that delivers a high level of category and channel expertise and services to these
customers.

Sales to the mass merchant channel accounted for approximately 44% of our net sales in the
year ended January 3, 2009. We sell all of our product categories in this channel primarily under
our

Hanes

,

Just My Size

,

Playtex

and

C9 by Champion

brands. Mass merchants feature high-volume,
low-cost sales of basic apparel items along with a diverse variety of consumer goods products, such
as grocery and drug products and other hard lines, and are characterized by large retailers, such
as Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, which accounted for approximately 27% of our net sales during the year ended
January 3, 2009, is our largest mass merchant customer.

Sales to the national chains and department stores channel accounted for approximately 18% of
our net sales during the year ended January 3, 2009. These retailers target a higher-income
consumer than mass merchants, focus more of their sales on apparel items rather than other consumer
goods such as grocery and drug products, and are characterized by large retailers such as Kohl’s,
JC Penney Company, Inc. and Sears Holdings Corporation. We sell all of our product categories in
this channel. Traditional department stores target higher-income consumers and carry more high-end,
fashion conscious products than national chains or mass merchants and tend to operate in
higher-income areas and commercial centers. Traditional department stores are characterized by
large retailers such as Macy’s and Dillard’s, Inc. We sell products in our intimate apparel,
hosiery and underwear categories through department stores.

Sales to the direct to consumer channel, which are included within the Innerwear segment,
accounted for approximately 9% of our net sales in the year ended January 3, 2009. We sell our
branded products directly to consumers through our 213 outlet stores, as well as our catalogs and
our web sites operating under the

Hanes

,

OneHanesPlace

,

Just My Size

and

Champion

names. Our outlet
stores are value-based, offering the consumer a savings of 25% to 40% off suggested retail prices,
and sell first-quality, excess, post-season, obsolete and slightly imperfect products. Our catalogs
and web sites address the growing direct to consumer channel that operates in today’s 24/7 retail
environment, and we have an active database of approximately three million consumers receiving our
catalogs and emails. Our web sites have experienced significant growth and we expect this trend to
continue as more consumers embrace this retail shopping channel.

Sales in our International segment represented approximately 11% of our net sales during the
year ended January 3, 2009, and included sales in Latin America, Asia, Canada and Europe. Canada,
Europe, Japan and Mexico are our largest international markets, and we also have sales offices in
India and China. We operate in several locations in Latin America including Mexico, Argentina,
Brazil and Central America. From an export business perspective, we use distributors to service
customers in the Middle East and Asia, and have a limited presence in Latin America. The brands
that are the primary focus of the export business include

Hanes

underwear and

Bali

,

Playtex

,

Wonderbra

and

barely there

intimate apparel. As discussed below under “Intellectual Property,” we
are not permitted to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded products in the member states of the EU, several other European countries, and South Africa.

Sales in other channels represented approximately 18% of our net sales during the year ended
January 3, 2009. We sell t-shirts, golf and sport shirts and fleece sweatshirts to third-party
embellishers primarily under our

Hanes

,

Hanes Beefy-T

and

Outer Banks

brands. Sales to third-party
embellishers accounted for approximately 8% of our net sales during the year ended January 3, 2009.
We also sell a significant range of our underwear, activewear and socks products under the

Champion

brand to wholesale clubs, such as Costco, and sporting goods stores, such as The



Sports Authority, Inc. We sell primarily legwear and underwear products under the

Hanes

and

L’eggs

brands to food,
drug and variety stores. We sell products that span across our Innerwear, Outerwear and Hosiery
segments to the U.S. military for sale to servicemen and servicewomen.

Inventory

Effective inventory management is a key component of our future success. Because our customers
do not purchase our products under long-term supply contracts, but rather on a purchase order
basis, effective inventory management requires close coordination with the customer base. Through
Kanban sales and production planning, inventory management, product scheduling, demand
prioritization and related initiatives that facilitate just-in-time production and ordering
systems, we seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively
managing inventory levels. We also employ various other types of inventory management techniques
that include collaborative forecasting and planning, vendor-managed inventory, key event management
and various forms of replenishment management processes. We have demand management planners in our
customer management group who work closely with customers to develop demand forecasts that are
passed to the supply chain. We also have professionals within the customer management group who
coordinate daily with our larger customers to help ensure that our customers’ planned inventory
levels are in fact available at their individual retail outlets. Additionally, within our supply
chain organization we have dedicated professionals who translate the demand forecast into our
inventory strategy and specific production plans. These individuals work closely with our customer
management team to balance inventory investment/exposure with customer service targets.

Seasonality and Other Factors

Our operating results are subject to some variability. Generally, our diverse range of product
offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. Sales are
typically higher in the last two quarters (July to December) of each fiscal year. Socks, hosiery
and fleece products generally have higher sales during this period as a result of cooler weather,
back-to-school shopping and holidays. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers’
decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer
demand. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products
ordered with minimal notice to us. For example, we experienced a shift in timing by our largest
retail customers of back-to-school programs from June to July in 2008. Our results of operations
are also impacted by fluctuations and volatility in the price of cotton and oil-related materials
and the timing of actual spending for our media, advertising and promotion expenses. Media,
advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on
the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions.

Marketing

Our strategy is to bring consumer-driven innovation to market in a compelling way. Our
approach is to build targeted, effective multimedia advertising and marketing campaigns to increase
awareness of our key brands. Driving growth platforms across categories is a major element of our
strategy as it enables us to meet key consumer needs and leverage advertising dollars. We believe
that the strength of our consumer insights, our distinctive brand propositions and our focus on
integrated marketing give us a competitive advantage in the fragmented apparel marketplace.

In 2008, we launched a number of new advertising and marketing initiatives:

•

We launched new “Look Who” advertising in June featuring Michael Jordan and Charlie
Sheen to support our new

Hanes Lay Flat Collar Undershirts

and

Hanes No Ride Up Boxer briefs

. The
campaign includes television advertising as well as online and video game advertising.

•

We introduced our new

Hanes No Ride Up Panty

with television advertising featuring
Sarah Chalke in another new “Look Who” advertising campaign.

•

Building on the 10-year strategic alliance with The Walt Disney Company that we entered
into in October 2007, we introduced a line of apparel inspired by the

Champion

items worn
by characters in Walt Disney Pictures’ “High School Musical 3: Senior Year” to coincide
with the opening of that movie in October 2008.



We also continued some of our existing advertising and marketing initiatives:

•

Our alliance with The Walt Disney Company includes a number of features.

Hanes

is the
presenting sponsor of the Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, one of the most
popular attractions at Disney-Hollywood Studios in Florida.

Hanes

has a customizable apparel
venue in Downtown Disney at Walt Disney World Resort that enables guests to design and
personalize their own custom t-shirts and other items.

Champion

has naming rights for the
stadium at Disney’s Wide World of Sports Complex, the nation’s premier amateur sports
venue. In addition to

Champion

Stadium,

Champion

has brand placement and promotional
opportunities throughout the complex. We have in-store promotional and brand building
opportunities at eight ESPN Zone restaurants and stores located across the country.

Hanes

and

Champion

have category exclusivity for select apparel at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim,
Calif., Walt Disney World Resort and Disney’s Wide World of Sports Complex Stadium, both
in Florida, and eight ESPN Zone stores. Our products, including t-shirts and tanks and
fleece sweatshirts, sweatpants, hoodies and other family fleece, including infant and
toddler items, are co-labeled, including

Disneyland Resort by Hanes

•

We continued our “How You Play” national advertising campaign for

Champion

that we
launched in 2007. The campaign, which is the first campaign for our

Champion

brand since
2003, includes print, out-of-home and online components and is designed to capture the
everyday moments of fun and sport in a series of cool and hip lifestyle images.

•

We continued the “Live Beautifully” campaign for our

Bali

brand, launched in the Spring
of 2007. The print, television and online ad campaign features Bali bras and panties from
its

Passion for Comfort

,

Seductive Curve

and

Cotton Creations

lines.

•

We continued our innovative and expressive advertising and marketing campaign called
“Girl Talk,” launched in September 2007, in which confident, everyday women talk about
their breasts, in support of our

Playtex 18 Hour

and

Playtex Secrets

product lines.

Distribution

As of January 3, 2009, we distributed our products for the U.S. market from a total of 22
distribution centers. These facilities include 20 facilities located in the U.S. and two
facilities located in regions where we manufacture our products. We internally manage and operate
16 of these facilities, and we use third-party logistics providers who operate the other six
facilities on our behalf. International distribution operations use a combination of third-party
logistics providers, as well as owned and operated distribution operations, to distribute goods to
our various international markets.

We are in the process of consolidating our distribution network to fewer larger facilities and
have reduced the number of distribution centers from the 48 that we maintained at the time of the
spin off to 36 as of January 3, 2009. In late 2008 we began preparing to ship products from a new
1.3 million square foot distribution center in Perris, California, and on January 13, 2009 began
shipping products from this facility to our customers.

Manufacturing and Sourcing

During the year ended January 3, 2009, approximately 66% of our finished goods sold were
manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and
operated by third-party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for
us, such as cutting and/or sewing. We sourced the remainder of our finished goods from third-party
manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our designs. We believe that our
balanced approach to product supply, which relies on a combination of owned, contracted and sourced
manufacturing located across different geographic regions, increases the efficiency of our
operations, reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply.

Finished Goods That Are Manufactured by Hanesbrands

The manufacturing process for finished goods that we manufacture begins with raw materials we
obtain from third parties. The principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and
synthetics. Our costs for cotton



yarn and cotton-based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton, which is
affected by, among other factors, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market
and the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer
countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. We attempt to
mitigate the effect of fluctuating raw material costs by entering into short-term supply agreements
that set the price we will pay for cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles in future periods. We also
enter into hedging contracts on cotton designed to protect us from severe market fluctuations in
the wholesale prices of cotton. In addition to cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles, we use thread
and trim for product identification, buttons, zippers, snaps and lace.

Fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may also influence the prices of items used in
our business, such as chemicals, dyestuffs, polyester yarn and foam. Alternate sources of these
materials and services are readily available. After they are sourced, cotton and synthetic
materials are spun into yarn, which is then knitted into cotton, synthetic and blended fabrics. We
spin a significant portion of the yarn and knit a significant portion of the fabrics we use in our
owned and operated facilities. To a lesser extent, we purchase fabric from several domestic and
international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production. These fabrics are cut and sewn
into finished products, either by us or by third-party contractors. Most of our cutting and sewing
operations are located in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin.

Rising fuel, energy and utility costs may have a significant impact on our manufacturing
costs. These costs may fluctuate due to a number of factors outside our control, including
government policy and regulation and weather conditions.

We continue to consolidate our manufacturing facilities and currently operate 52 manufacturing
facilities, down from 70 at the time of our spin off. In making decisions about the location of
manufacturing operations and third-party sources of supply, we consider a number of factors,
including local labor costs, quality of production, applicable quotas and duties, and freight
costs. During the second quarter of 2008, we added three company-owned sewing plants in Southeast
Asia — two in Vietnam and one in Thailand — giving us four sewing plants in Asia. In October
2008, we acquired a 370-employee embroidery facility in Honduras. For the past eight years, these
operations have produced embroidered and screen-printed apparel for us. This acquisition better
positions us for long-term growth in these segments. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we
commenced production at our 500,000 square foot socks manufacturing facility in El Salvador. This
facility, co-located with textile manufacturing operations that we acquired in 2007, provides a
manufacturing base in Central America from which to leverage our production scale at a lower cost
location. We also continued construction of a textile production plant in Nanjing, China, which
will be our first company-owned textile production facility in Asia. We expect production to
commence in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Nanjing textile facility will enable us to expand and
leverage our production scale in Asia as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres.

Finished Goods That Are Manufactured by Third Parties

In addition to our manufacturing capabilities, we also source finished goods we design from
third-party manufacturers, also referred to as “turnkey products.” Many of these turnkey products
are sourced from international suppliers by our strategic sourcing hubs in Hong Kong and other
locations in Asia.

All contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high quality standards. Further, all
contractors and third-party manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict supplier and
business practices guidelines. These requirements provide strict standards covering hours of work,
age of workers, health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws. Each new supplier must
be inspected and agree to comprehensive compliance terms prior to performance of any production on
our behalf. We audit compliance with these standards and maintain strict compliance performance
records. In addition to our audit procedures, we require certain of our suppliers to be Worldwide
Responsible Apparel Production, or “WRAP,” certified. WRAP is a recognized apparel certification
program that independently monitors and certifies compliance with certain specified manufacturing
standards that are intended to ensure that a given factory produces sewn goods under lawful,
humane, and ethical conditions. WRAP uses third-party, independent certification firms and requires
factory-by-factory certification.

Trade Regulation

We are exposed to certain risks of doing business outside of the United States. We import
goods from company-owned facilities in Asia, Central America, the Caribbean Basin and Mexico, and
from suppliers in those areas and in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. These import transactions
had been subject to constraints imposed



by bilateral agreements that imposed quotas that limited
the amount of certain categories of merchandise from certain countries that could be imported into
the United States and the EU.

Effective on January 1, 2005, the United States and other World Trade Organization, or “WTO,”
member countries, with few exceptions, removed quotas on textile and apparel goods from WTO member
countries including China. However in the middle of 2005, several countries, including the United
States, imposed special safeguard quotas on some Chinese textile and apparel goods pursuant special
provisions contained in China’s Accession Agreement to the WTO. These quotas expired at the end of
2008. Under different provisions of U.S. law, similar safeguard quotas may be re-imposed against
China or imposed against other countries in the future. Our management evaluates the possible
impact of these and similar actions on our ability to import products from China. If such
safeguards were to be re-imposed, we do not expect that these restraints would have a material
impact on us.

Our management monitors new developments and risks relating to duties, tariffs and quotas.
Changes in these areas have the potential to harm or, in some cases, benefit our business. In
response to the changing import environment resulting from the elimination of quotas, management
has chosen to continue its balanced approach to manufacturing and sourcing. We attempt to limit our
sourcing exposure through geographic diversification with a mix of company-owned and contracted
production, as well as shifts of production among countries and contractors. We will continue to
manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global
production environment.

We also monitor a number of international security risks. We are a member of the Customs-Trade
Partnership Against Terrorism, or “C-TPAT,” a partnership between the government and private sector
initiated after the events of September 11, 2001 to improve supply chain and border security.
C-TPAT partners work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to protect their supply chains from
concealment of terrorist weapons, including weapons of mass destruction. In exchange, U.S. Customs
and Border Protection provides reduced inspections at the port of arrival and expedited processing
at the border.

Competition

The apparel essentials market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Competition
generally is based upon price, brand name recognition, product quality, selection, service and
purchasing convenience. Our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and
foreign manufacturers. These competitors include Berskhire Hathaway Inc. through its subsidiary
Fruit of the Loom, Inc., Warnaco Group Inc., Maidenform Brands, Inc. and Gildan Activewear, Inc. in
our Innerwear business segment and Gildan Activewear, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc. through its
subsidiaries Russell Corporation and Fruit of the Loom, Inc., Nike, Inc., adidas AG through its
adidas and Reebok brands and Under Armour Inc. in our Outerwear business segment. We also compete
with many small manufacturers across all of our business segments, including our International
segment. Additionally, department stores and other retailers, including many of our customers,
market and sell apparel essentials products under private labels that compete directly with our
brands. We also face intense competition from specialty stores that sell private label apparel not
manufactured by us such as Victoria’s Secret, Old Navy and The Gap.

Our competitive strengths include our strong brands with leading market positions, our
high-volume, core essentials focus, our significant scale of operations and our strong customer
relationships.

•

Strong Brands with Leading Market Positions.

According to NPD, our brands hold either
the number one or number two U.S. market position by sales value in most product categories
in which we compete, for the 12 month period ended November 30, 2008. According to NPD, our
largest brand,

Hanes

, is the top-selling apparel brand in the United States by units sold,
for the 12 month period ended November 30, 2008.

•

High-Volume, Core Essentials Focus.

We sell high-volume, frequently replenished apparel
essentials. The majority of our core styles continue from year to year, with variations only in color,
fabric or design details, and are frequently replenished by consumers. We believe that our
status as a high-volume seller of core apparel essentials creates a more stable and
predictable revenue base and reduces our exposure to dramatic fashion shifts often observed
in the general apparel industry.

•

Significant Scale of Operations.

According to NPD, we are the largest seller of apparel
essentials in the United States as measured by sales value for the 12 month period ended
November 30, 2008. Most of our products are sold to large retailers that have high-volume
demands. We believe that we are able to leverage



our significant scale of operations to
provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing power and product design,
marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors.

•

Strong Customer Relationships.

We sell our products primarily through large,
high-volume retailers, including mass merchants, department stores and national chains. We
have strong, long-term relationships with our top customers, including relationships of
more than ten years with each of our top ten customers. We have aligned significant parts
of our organization with corresponding parts of our customers’ organizations. We also have
entered into customer-specific programs such as the

C9 by Champion

products marketed and
sold through Target stores.

Intellectual Property

sale in February 2006 of its European branded apparel business, an affiliate of Sun Capital
Partners, Inc., or “Sun Capital,” has an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to manufacture,
sell and distribute apparel products under the

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

trademarks in the member
states of the EU, as well as several other European nations and South Africa. We also own a number
of copyrights. Our trademarks and copyrights are important to our marketing efforts and have
substantial value. We aggressively protect these trademarks and copyrights from infringement and
dilution through appropriate measures, including court actions and administrative proceedings.

Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally remain valid as long as they are
in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Most of the trademarks in our portfolio,
including our core brands, are covered by trademark registrations in the countries of the world in
which we do business, with registration periods generally ranging between seven and 10 years
depending on the country. Trademark registrations can be renewed indefinitely as long as the
trademarks are in use. We have an active program designed to ensure that our trademarks are
registered, renewed, protected and maintained. We plan to continue to use all of our core
trademarks and plan to renew the registrations for such trademarks for as long as we continue to
use them. Most of our copyrights are unregistered, although we have a sizable portfolio of
copyrighted lace designs that are the subject of a number of registrations at the U.S. Copyright
Office.

We place high importance on product innovation and design, and a number of these innovations
and designs are the subject of patents. However, we do not regard any segment of our business as
being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we own proprietary
trade secrets, technology, and know how that we have not patented.

Shared Trademark Relationship with Sun Capital

In February 2006, Sara Lee sold its European branded apparel business to an affiliate of Sun
Capital. In connection with the sale, Sun Capital received an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free
license to manufacture, sell and distribute apparel products under the

Wonderbra

and

Japan. We are not permitted to sell

DIM

or

UNNO

branded apparel products outside of these countries
and Sun Capital is not permitted to sell

DIM

or

UNNO

branded apparel products inside these
countries. In addition, the rights to certain European-originated brands previously part of Sara
Lee’s branded apparel portfolio were transferred to Sun Capital and are not included in our brand
portfolio.

Licensing Relationship with Tupperware Corporation

In December 2005, Sara Lee sold its direct selling business, which markets cosmetics, skin
care products, toiletries and clothing in 18 countries, to Tupperware Corporation, or “Tupperware.”
In connection with the sale, Dart Industries Inc., or “Dart,” an affiliate of Tupperware, received
a three-year exclusive license agreement which expires in June 2009 to use the

trademarks for the manufacture and sale, under the applicable brands, of certain men’s and women’s
apparel in the Philippines, including underwear, socks, sportswear products, bras, panties and
girdles, and for the exhaustion of similar product inventory in Malaysia. Dart also received a
ten-year, royalty-free, exclusive license to use the

Girls’ Attitudes

trademark for the manufacture
and sale of certain toiletries, cosmetics, intimate apparel, underwear, sports wear, watches, bags
and towels in the Philippines. The rights and obligations under these agreements were assigned to
us as part of the spin off.

In connection with the sale of Sara Lee’s direct selling business, Tupperware also signed two
five-year distributorship agreements providing Tupperware with the right, which is exclusive for
the first three years of the agreements, to distribute and sell, through door-to-door and similar
channels,

apparel items in
Mexico that we have discontinued and/or determined to be obsolete. The agreements also provide
Tupperware with the exclusive right for five years to distribute and sell through such channels
such apparel items sold by us in the ordinary course of business. The agreements also grant a
limited right to use such trademarks solely in connection with the distribution and sale of those
products in Mexico.

Under the terms of the agreements, we reserve the right to apply for, prosecute and maintain
trademark registrations in Mexico for those products covered by the distributorship agreement. The
rights and obligations under these agreements were assigned to us as part of the spin off.

Corporate Social Responsibility

We have a formal corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) program that consists of five
initiatives: a global business practices ethics program for all employees worldwide; a facility
compliance program that seeks to ensure company and supplier plants meet our labor and social
compliance standards; a product safety program; a global environmental management system that seeks
to reduce the environmental impact of our operations; and a commitment to corporate philanthropy
which seeks to meet the “fundamental needs” of the communities in which we live and work. We
employ over 20 full-time CSR personnel across the globe to manage our program.

In February 2008, we joined the Fair Labor Association and will undergo the Fair Labor
Association’s two-year implementation process for accreditation of our global social compliance
program. The Fair Labor Association works with industry, civil society organizations and colleges
and universities to protect workers’ rights and improve working conditions in factories around the
world. Participating companies in the Fair Labor Association are required to fulfill 10 company
obligations, including conducting internal monitoring of facilities, submitting to independent
monitoring audits and verification, and managing and reporting information on their compliance
efforts. The Fair Labor Association conducts unannounced independent external monitoring audits of
a sample of a participating company’s plants and suppliers and publishes the results of those
audits (and any corrective action plans that may be needed) for the public to review.

We incorporate Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or “LEED”-based practices into
many remodeling and new construction projects for our facilities around the world. In May 2008, we
earned the U.S. Green Building Council’s sustainability certification for our Bentonville, Arkansas
sales office. The LEED certification was the first in Bentonville and the first for commercial
interiors in Arkansas. The approximately 10,000 square-foot office, which opened in August 2007 to
support our business with Wal-Mart, features advanced lighting, heating and cooling systems,
natural light for every workspace, energy-efficient appliances, and low-



emission construction
materials such as paint, adhesives, sealants, carpet, coatings and furniture. LEED for Commercial
Interiors is the tenant-improvement category of the U.S. Green Building Council’s nationally
accepted LEED Green Building Rating System. The category honors tenants without whole-building
control who follow rigorous sustainability guidelines to design or improve their interior space.
The LEED-certification process took seven months and required a third-party commissioning agent to
verify the achievement of U.S. Green Building Council standards, including the performance of
lighting and ventilation systems.

In addition, our new distribution center in Perris, California was built to stringent
standards set by the U.S. Green Building Council, and we will seek certification for the building
from the Green Building Council for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, which would make
it the largest LEED-certified warehouse in Southern California and one of the biggest in the world.
Sustainable features of this distribution center include reduction of energy usage through
extensive use of natural skylighting, motion-detection lighting, a design that does not require
heating or air conditioning for a comfortable working environment, reduction of water usage
compared with typical warehouses of its size through low-water bathroom fixtures and low-water
landscaping, innovative site grading techniques and use of locally produced concrete and steel and
many other LEED concepts such as use of paints, carpets and other materials with low volatile
organic compound content, an organic-focused pest control program that minimizes chemical pesticide
use, location near public transportation to reduce the parking lot size and reliance on automobile
transportation, preferred parking for low-emission and low-energy vehicles, and on-site bicycle
storage and shower and changing room facilities.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern
our activities, operations and products that may have adverse environmental, health and safety
effects, including laws and regulations relating to generating emissions, water discharges, waste,
product and packaging content and workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations
may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions. We are aware of hazardous
substances or petroleum releases at a few of our facilities and are working with the relevant
environmental authorities to investigate and address such releases. We also have been identified as
a “potentially responsible party” at a few waste disposal sites undergoing investigation and
cleanup under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(commonly known as Superfund) or state Superfund equivalent programs. Where we have determined that
a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated, we have
accrued amounts in our balance sheet for losses related to these sites. Compliance with
environmental laws and regulations and our remedial environmental obligations historically have not
had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any proposed regulations or
remedial obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital expenditures in order to
comply.

Government Regulation

We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that could affect our
business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer
Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the
rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and various environmental laws and
regulations. Our international businesses are subject to similar laws and regulations in the
countries in which they operate. Our operations also are subject to various international trade
agreements and regulations. See “— Trade Regulation.” While we believe that we are in compliance
in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, current governmental
regulations may change or become more stringent or unforeseen events may occur, any of which could
have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Employees

As of January 3, 2009, we had approximately 45,200 employees, approximately 10,200 of whom
were located in the United States. Of the employees located in the United States, approximately
2,200 were full or part-time employees in our stores within our direct to consumer channel. As of
January 3, 2009, in the United States, approximately 30 employees were covered by collective
bargaining agreements. A portion of our international employees were also covered by collective
bargaining agreements. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.



Item 1A.

Risk Factors

This section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our
financial results or operations or that could change, for the worse, existing trends in our
businesses. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or on
the trading prices of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that currently are
not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our
businesses and operations.

We are continuing to execute our consolidation and globalization strategy and this process involves
significant costs and the risk of operational interruption.

The implementation of our consolidation and globalization strategy, which is designed to
improve operating efficiencies and lower costs, has resulted and is likely to continue to result in
significant costs in the short-term and generate savings as well as higher inventory levels for the
next 12 to 15 months. As further plans are developed and approved, we expect to recognize
additional restructuring costs as we eliminate duplicative functions within the organization and
transition a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to lower-cost locations. As a
result of this strategy, we expect to incur approximately $250 million in restructuring and related
charges over the three year period following the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006, of
which approximately half is expected to be noncash. As of January 3, 2009, we have recognized
approximately $209 million and announced approximately $219 million in restructuring and related
charges related to this strategy since September 5, 2006. This process may also result in
operational interruptions, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

Our supply chain relies on an extensive network of foreign operations and any disruption to or
adverse impact on such operations may adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

We have an extensive global supply chain in which a significant portion of our products are
manufactured in or sourced from locations in Asia, Central America, the Caribbean Basin and Mexico
and we are continuing to add new manufacturing capacity in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean
Basin. Potential events that may disrupt our foreign operations include:

Disruptions in our foreign supply chain could negatively impact our business by interrupting
production in facilities outside the United States, increasing our cost of sales, disrupting
merchandise deliveries, delaying receipt of the products into the United States or preventing us
from sourcing our products at all. Depending on timing, these



events could also result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. All of
the foregoing can have an adverse affect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows.

Current economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit
and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of
which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows.

Worldwide economic conditions have recently deteriorated significantly in many countries and
regions, including the United States, and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Although
the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a
planned, rather than on an impulse, basis, our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by our
customers. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors, including, among others, general
business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer
credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, electricity power rates, gasoline prices, unemployment
trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factors are
outside of our control. Our customers’ purchases of discretionary items, including our products,
could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, when prices increase in response to
rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. For example, we
experienced a spike in oil related commodity prices during the summer of 2008. Increases in our
product costs may not be offset by comparable rises in the income of consumers of our products.
These consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or lower-priced products of our
competitors in response to higher prices for our products, or may choose not to purchase our
products at prices that reflect our domestic price increases that become effective from time to
time. If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions continue to challenge the
consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could
be adversely affected.

In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in
financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable
events for our customers, suppliers of raw materials and finished goods, logistics and other
service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and
derivatives transactions. In addition, the inability of these third parties to overcome these
difficulties may increase. For example, one of our customers, Mervyn’s, a regional retailer in
California and the Southwest that originally filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 in July
2008, announced in October 2008 its intention to wind down its business and conduct
going-out-of-business sales at remaining store locations. If third parties on which we rely for
raw materials, finished goods or services are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the
deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and provide us with the materials and services we
need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities or derivatives transactions do not perform
their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be
adversely affected.

Our customers generally purchase our products on credit, and as a result, our results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if our customers
experience financial difficulties.

During the past several years, various retailers, including some of our largest customers,
have experienced significant difficulties, including restructurings, bankruptcies and liquidations,
and the inability of retailers to overcome these difficulties may increase due to the recent
deterioration of worldwide economic conditions. This could adversely affect us because our
customers generally pay us after goods are delivered. Adverse changes in a customer’s financial
position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume
more credit risk relating to that customer’s future purchases or limit our ability to collect
accounts receivable relating to previous purchases by that customer. Any of these occurrences
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows.

Our indebtedness subjects us to various restrictions and could decrease our profitability and
otherwise adversely affect our business.

As described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources,” our indebtedness includes the $2.1 billion senior
secured credit facility that we entered into on September 5, 2006 (the “Senior Secured Credit
Facility”), the $450 million senior secured second lien credit facility that we entered into on
September 5, 2006 (the “Second Lien Credit Facility” and, together with
the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities”), our $500 million Floating Rate
Senior Notes due 2014 (the “Floating Rate Senior Notes”) and the $250 million accounts receivable
securitization facility that we entered into on November 27, 2007 (the “Receivables Facility”). The
Senior Secured Credit Facility, Second Lien Credit



Facility and the indenture governing the
Floating Rate Senior Notes contain restrictions that affect, and in some cases significantly limit
or prohibit, among other things, our ability to borrow funds, pay dividends or make other
distributions, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, or create liens on our
assets.

Our leverage also could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that
are less leveraged. These competitors could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic
acquisitions, secure additional financing for their operations by incurring additional debt, expend
capital to expand their manufacturing and production operations to lower-cost areas and apply
pricing pressure on us. In addition, because many of our customers rely on us to fulfill a
substantial portion of their apparel essentials demand, any concern these customers may have
regarding our financial condition may cause them to reduce the amount of products they purchase
from us. Our leverage could also impede our ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the
economy.

If we are unable to maintain financial ratios associated with our indebtedness, such failure could
cause the acceleration of the maturity of such indebtedness which would adversely affect our
business.

Covenants in the Credit Facilities and the Receivables Facility require us to maintain a
minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to EBITDA (earnings before income taxes,
depreciation expense and amortization), or leverage ratio. The recent deterioration of worldwide
economic conditions could impact our ability to maintain the financial ratios contained in these
agreements. If we fail to maintain these financial ratios, that failure could result in a default
that accelerates the maturity of the indebtedness under such facilities, which could require that
we repay such indebtedness in full, together with accrued and unpaid interest, unless we are able
to negotiate new financial ratios or waivers of our current ratios with our lenders. Even if we
are able to negotiate new financial ratios or waivers of our current financial ratios, we may be
required to pay fees or make other concessions that may adversely impact our business. Any one of
these options could result in significantly higher interest expense in 2009 and beyond. In
addition, these options could require modification of our interest rate derivative portfolio, which
could require us to make a cash payment in the event of terminating a derivative instrument or
impact the effectiveness of our interest rate hedging instruments and
require us to take non-cash charges. For information regarding our
compliance with these covenants, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Trends and Uncertainties Affecting
Liquidity.”

If we fail to meet our payment or other obligations, the lenders could foreclose on, and acquire
control of, substantially all of our assets.

In connection with our incurrence of indebtedness under the Credit Facilities, the lenders
under those facilities have received a pledge of substantially all of our existing and future
direct and indirect subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon exceptions for foreign
subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries. Additionally, these lenders generally have a lien on
substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. The
financial institutions that are party to the Receivables Facility have a lien on certain of our
domestic accounts receivables. As a result of these pledges and liens, if we fail to meet our
payment or other obligations under the Credit Facilities or the Receivables Facility, the lenders
under those facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and, at
their option, liquidate these assets.

Our indebtedness restricts our ability to obtain additional capital in the future.

The restrictions contained in the Credit Facilities and in the indenture governing the
Floating Rate Senior Notes could limit our ability to obtain additional capital in the future to
fund capital expenditures or acquisitions, meet our debt payment obligations and capital
commitments, fund any operating losses or future development of our business affiliates, obtain
lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous
transactions that monetize our assets, or conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities.

If we need to incur additional debt or issue equity in order to fund working capital and
capital expenditures or to make acquisitions and other investments, debt or equity financing may
not be available to us on acceptable terms
or at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing, we may be unable to maintain or
expand our business. If we raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity, any debt securities
or preferred stock issued will have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders
of our common stock in the event of a liquidation, and the terms of the debt securities may impose
restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through the issuance of equity, the issuance
would dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders.



To service our debt obligations, we may need to increase the portion of the income of our foreign
subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the United States, which could increase our income
tax expense.

The amount of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the United
States may significantly impact our U.S. federal income tax expense. We pay U.S. federal income
taxes on that portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to
the United States and be taxable. In order to service our debt obligations, we may need to increase
the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the United States,
which may significantly increase our income tax expense. Consequently, our income tax expense has
been, and will continue to be, impacted by our strategic initiative to make substantial capital
investments outside the United States.

Significant fluctuations and volatility in the price of cotton and other raw materials we purchase
may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows.

Cotton is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of many of our products. Our costs
for cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton, which is
affected by weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative
valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other
factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. While we do enter into short-term
supply agreements and hedges from time to time in an attempt to protect our business from the
volatility of the market price of cotton, our business can be affected by dramatic movements in
cotton prices, although cotton represents only 8% of our cost of sales. Cotton prices were 65 cents
per pound for the year ended January 3, 2009 and 56 cents per pound for the year ended December 29,
2007. The price of cotton currently in our inventory is in the mid 60 cents per pound range which
is the price that will impact our operating results in the first half of 2009. The prices for the
most recent cotton crop, which will impact our operating results in the second half of 2009, have
decreased to the low 50 cents per pound range.

We are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the
market price of cotton through short-term supply agreements and hedges, and our business can be
adversely affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices. For example, we estimate that a change
of $0.01 per pound in cotton prices would affect our annual raw material costs by $3 million, at
current levels of production. The ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be
quantified, as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain,
but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton would have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, during the summer of 2008 we experienced a spike in oil related commodity prices
and other raw materials used in our products, such as dyes and chemicals, and increases in other
costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs. These costs may fluctuate due to a number of
factors outside our control, including government policy and regulation and weather conditions.

Current market returns have had a negative impact on the return on plan assets for our pension and
other postemployment plans, which may require significant funding.

As widely reported, financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have been
experiencing extreme disruption in recent months. As a result of this disruption in the domestic
and international equity and bond markets, our pension plans and
other postemployment plans had a
decrease in asset values of approximately 32% during the year ended January 3, 2009. We are unable
to predict the severity or the duration of the current disruptions in the financial markets and the
adverse economic conditions in the United States, Europe and Asia. We are not required to make any
mandatory contributions to our plans in 2009. Nevertheless, the funded status of these plans, and
the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors that are
subject to an inherent degree
of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment. Under the Pension Protection
Act of 2006 (the “Pension Protection Act”), continued losses of asset values may necessitate
increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements. The
continued downward pressure on the asset values of these plans may require us to fund obligations
earlier than we had originally planned, which would have a negative impact on cash flows from
operations.



The loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials may interrupt our
supplies and materially harm our business.

We purchase all of the raw materials used in our products and approximately 34% of the apparel
designed by us from a limited number of third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Our ability to
meet our customers’ needs depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw
materials and finished products from our third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Our business,
financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our principal
third-party suppliers or manufacturers experience financial difficulties that they are not able to
overcome resulting from the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions, reproduction problems,
lack of capacity or transportation disruptions. The magnitude of this risk depends upon the timing
of any interruptions, the materials or products that the third-party manufacturers provide and the
volume of production.

Our dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished products subjects us to the
risk of supplier failure and customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products. Quality
failures by our third-party manufacturers or changes in their financial or business condition that
affect their production could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers and
thereby materially harm our business.

If we fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may be required to establish additional
inventory reserves or we may not carry enough inventory to meet customer demands, causing us to
suffer lower margins or losses.

We are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our inventory with our ability to meet
marketplace needs. We continually monitor our inventory levels to best balance current supply and
demand with potential future demand that typically surges when consumers no longer postpone
purchases in our product categories. Inventory reserves can result from the complexity of our
supply chain, a long manufacturing process and the seasonal nature of certain products. Increases
in inventory levels may also be needed to service our business as we continue to execute our
consolidation and globalization strategy. As a result, we could be subject to high levels of
obsolescence and excess stock. Based on discussions with our customers and internally generated
projections, we produce, purchase and/or store raw material and finished goods inventory to meet
our expected demand for delivery. However, we sell a large number of our products to a small number
of customers, and these customers generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods. If,
after producing and storing inventory in anticipation of deliveries, demand is lower than expected,
we may have to hold inventory for extended periods or sell excess inventory at reduced prices, in
some cases below our cost. There are inherent uncertainties related to the recoverability of
inventory, and it is possible that market factors and other conditions underlying the valuation of
inventory may change in the future and result in further reserve requirements. Excess inventory
charges can reduce gross margins or result in operating losses, lowered plant and equipment
utilization and lowered fixed operating cost absorption, all of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Conversely, we also are exposed to lost business opportunities if we underestimate market
demand and produce too little inventory for any particular period. Because sales of our products
are generally not made under contract, if we do not carry enough inventory to satisfy our
customers’ demands for our products within an acceptable time frame, they may seek to fulfill their
demands from one or several of our competitors and may reduce the amount of business they do with
us. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

We rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales, and the
loss of or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers would have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

During the year ended January 3, 2009, our top ten customers accounted for 65% of our net
sales and our top customers, Wal-Mart and Target, accounted for 27% and 16% of our net sales,
respectively. We expect that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of
our net sales in the future. In addition, our top customers are the largest market participants in
our primary distribution channels across all of our product lines. Any loss of or material
reduction in sales to any of our top ten customers, especially Wal-Mart and Target, would be
difficult to recapture, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.



We generally do not sell our products under contracts, and, as a result, our customers are
generally not contractually obligated to purchase our products, which causes some uncertainty as to
future sales and inventory levels.

We generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our
products, and as a result, most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis. For example, we
have no agreements with Wal-Mart that obligate Wal-Mart to purchase our products. If any of our
customers experiences a significant downturn in its business, or fails to remain committed to our
products or brands, the customer is generally under no contractual obligation to purchase our
products and, consequently, may reduce or discontinue purchases from us. In the past, such actions
have resulted in a decrease in sales and an increase in our inventory and have had an adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If such actions
occur again in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition will likely
be similarly affected.

Our existing customers may require products on an exclusive basis, forms of economic support and
other changes that could be harmful to our business.

Customers increasingly may require us to provide them with some of our products on an
exclusive basis, which could cause an increase in the number of stock keeping units, or “SKUs,” we
must carry and, consequently, increase our inventory levels and working capital requirements.
Moreover, our customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances, incentives and other forms of
economic support which reduce our gross margins and affect our profitability. Our financial
performance is negatively affected by these pricing pressures when we are forced to reduce our
prices without being able to correspondingly reduce our production costs.

We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and our market share and results of
operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the future.

The apparel essentials market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly. Competition is
generally based upon price, brand name recognition, product quality, selection, service and
purchasing convenience. Our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and
foreign manufacturers. These competitors include Berskhire Hathaway Inc. through its subsidiary
Fruit of the Loom, Inc., Warnaco Group Inc., Maidenform Brands, Inc. and Gildan Activewear, Inc. in
our Innerwear business segment and Gildan Activewear, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway Inc. through its
subsidiaries Russell Corporation and Fruit of the Loom, Inc., Nike, Inc., adidas AG through its
adidas and Reebok brands and Under Armour Inc. in our Outerwear business segment. We also compete
with many small manufacturers across all of our business segments, including our International
segment. Additionally, department stores, specialty stores and other retailers, including many of
our customers, market and sell apparel essentials products under private labels that compete
directly with our brands. These customers may buy goods that are manufactured by others, which
represents a lost business opportunity for us, or they may sell private label products manufactured
by us, which have significantly lower gross margins than our branded products. We also face intense
competition from specialty stores that sell private label apparel not manufactured by us, such as
Victoria’s Secret, Old Navy and The Gap. Increased competition may result in a loss of or a
reduction in shelf space and promotional support and reduced prices, in each case decreasing our
cash flows, operating margins and profitability. Our ability to remain competitive in the areas of
price, quality, brand recognition, research and product development, manufacturing and distribution
will, in large part, determine our future success. If we fail to compete successfully, our market
share, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

Sales of and demand for our products may decrease if we fail to keep pace with evolving consumer
preferences and trends, which could have an adverse effect on net sales and profitability.

Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer
preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable product
offerings. If we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify or react to changing styles or
trends or misjudge the market for our products, our sales may be lower than expected and we may be
faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory. In response, we may be forced
to increase our marketing promotions, provide markdown allowances to
our customers or liquidate excess merchandise, any of which could have a material adverse
effect on our net sales and profitability. Our brand image may also suffer if customers believe
that we are no longer able to offer innovative products, respond to consumer preferences or
maintain the quality of our products.



We are prohibited from selling our Wonderbra and Playtex intimate apparel products in the EU, as
well as certain other countries in Europe and South Africa, and therefore are unable to take
advantage of business opportunities that may arise in such countries.

In February 2006, Sara Lee sold its European branded apparel business to Sun Capital. In
connection with the sale, Sun Capital received an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to
manufacture, sell and distribute apparel products under the

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

trademarks in the
member states of the EU, as well as Russia, South Africa, Switzerland and certain other nations in
Europe. Due to the exclusive license, we are not permitted to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded
products in these nations and Sun Capital is not permitted to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded
products outside of these nations. Consequently, we will not be able to take advantage of business
opportunities that may arise relating to the sale of

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

products in these
nations. For more information on these sales restrictions see “Business — Intellectual Property.”

Our business could be harmed if we are unable to deliver our products to the market due to problems
with our distribution network.

We distribute our products from facilities that we operate as well as facilities that are
operated by third-party logistics providers. These facilities include a combination of owned,
leased and contracted distribution centers. We are in the process of consolidating our
distribution network to fewer larger facilities, including the recent opening of a 1.3 million
square foot facility in Perris, California. This consolidation of our distribution network will
involve significant change, including movement of product during the transitional period,
implementation of new warehouse management systems and technology, and opening of new distribution
centers and new third-party logistics providers to replace parts of our legacy distribution
network. Because substantially all of our products are distributed from a relatively small number
of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by extraordinary weather conditions or
natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods or fires near our distribution
centers. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the
adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions to our distribution network. In
addition, our distribution network is dependent on the timely performance of services by third
parties, including the transportation of product to and from our distribution facilities. If we are
unable to successfully operate our distribution network, our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure with respect to our
information technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.

Our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on our
information technology systems. As part of our efforts to consolidate our operations, we also
expect to continue to incur costs associated with the integration of our information technology
systems across our company over the next several years. This process involves the consolidation or
possible replacement of technology platforms so that our business functions are served by fewer
platforms, and has resulted in operational inefficiencies and in some cases increased our costs. We
are subject to the risk that we will not be able to absorb the level of systems change, commit the
necessary resources or focus the management attention necessary for the implementation to succeed.
Many key strategic initiatives of major business functions, such as our supply chain and our
finance operations, depend on advanced capabilities enabled by the new systems and if we fail to
properly execute or if we miss critical deadlines in the implementation of this initiative, we
could experience serious disruption and harm to our business. The failure of these systems to
operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in
integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems
could adversely impact the operations of our business.

If we experience a data security breach and confidential customer information is disclosed, we may
be subject to penalties and experience negative publicity, which could affect our customer
relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business.

In addition, we and our customers could suffer harm if customer information were accessed by
third parties due to a security failure in our systems. The collection of data and processing of
transactions through our direct-to-consumer internet and catalog operations require us to receive
and store a large amount of personally identifiable data. This type of data is subject to
legislation and regulation in various jurisdictions. Recently, data security breaches suffered by
well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention,
prompting state and federal legislative proposals addressing data privacy and security. If some of
the current



proposals are adopted, we may be subject to more extensive requirements to protect the
customer information that we process in connection with the purchases of our products. We may
become exposed to potential liabilities with respect to the data that we collect, manage and
process, and may incur legal costs if our information security policies and procedures are not
effective or if we are required to defend our methods of collection, processing and storage of
personal data. Future investigations, lawsuits or adverse publicity relating to our methods of
handling personal data could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows due to the costs and negative market reaction relating to such
developments.

Compliance with environmental and other regulations could require significant expenditures.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern
our activities, operations and products that may have adverse environmental, health and safety
effects, including laws and regulations relating to generating emissions, water discharges, waste,
product and packaging content and workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations
may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions. Future events that could give
rise to manufacturing interruptions or environmental remediation include changes in existing laws
and regulations, the enactment of new laws and regulations, a release of hazardous substances on or
from our properties or any associated offsite disposal location, or the discovery of contamination
from current or prior activities at any of our properties. While we are not aware of any proposed
regulations or remedial obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital expenditures in
order to comply, any such regulations or obligations could adversely affect our business, results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

International trade regulations may increase our costs or limit the amount of products that we can
import from suppliers in a particular country, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

Because a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located, or
our products are sourced from, outside the United States, we are subject to international trade
regulations. The international trade regulations to which we are subject or may become subject
include tariffs, safeguards or quotas. These regulations could limit the countries in which we
produce or from which we source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or
obtaining materials originating from certain countries. Restrictions imposed by international trade
regulations can have a particular impact on our business when, after we have moved our operations
to a particular location, new unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable
regulations currently in effect are changed. The countries in which our products are manufactured
or into which they are imported may from time to time impose additional new regulations, or modify
existing regulations, including:

Adverse international trade regulations, including those listed above, would have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Due to the extensive nature of our foreign operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates could negatively impact our results of operations.

We sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars; however, we
purchase many of our raw materials, including cotton, our primary raw material, pay a portion of
our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies. As a result, when the
U.S. dollar weakens against any of these currencies, our cost of sales could increase
substantially. Outside the United States, we may pay for materials or finished products in U.S.
dollars, and in some cases a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could effectively increase our costs
where we use foreign currency to purchase the U.S. dollars we need to make such payments. We use
foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in
foreign exchange rates. We are also exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our Consolidated
Financial Statements due to the translation of operating results and financial position of our
foreign subsidiaries.

We had approximately 45,200 employees worldwide as of January 3, 2009, and our business operations
and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our
employees or changes to U.S. or foreign employment regulations.

We had approximately 45,200 employees worldwide as of January 3, 2009. This means we have a
significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our
employees, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage
requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship
requirements and payroll taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs.
Approximately 35,000 of those employees were outside of the United States. A significant increase
in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have employees could have a significant
impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps
to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs, expend resources
responding to such increases and lower our margins.

In addition, some of our employees are members of labor organizations or are covered by
collective bargaining agreements. If there were a significant increase in the number of our
employees who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining
agreements, we would become vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action by these
employees that could have an adverse effect on our business.

We may suffer negative publicity if we or our third-party manufacturers violate labor laws or
engage in practices that are viewed as unethical or illegal, which could cause a loss of business.

We cannot fully control the business and labor practices of our third-party manufacturers, the
majority of whom are located in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. If one of our own
manufacturing operations or one of our third-party manufacturers violates or is accused of
violating local or international labor laws or other applicable regulations, or engages in labor or
other practices that would be viewed in any market in which our products are sold as unethical, we
could suffer negative publicity, which could tarnish our brands’ image or result in a loss of
sales. In addition, if such negative publicity affected one of our customers, it could result in a
loss of business for us.

Our business depends on our senior management team and other key personnel.

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other
key personnel, some of whom have unique talents and experience and would be difficult to replace.
The loss or interruption of the
services of a member of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a
material adverse effect on our business during the transitional period that would be required for a
successor to assume the responsibilities of the position. Our future success will also depend on
our ability to attract and retain key managers, sales people and others. We may not be able to
attract or retain these employees, which could adversely affect our business.



The success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation of our brands, including brands
that we license to other parties. If other parties take actions that weaken, harm the reputation of
or cause confusion with our brands, our business, and consequently our sales, results of operations
and cash flows, may be adversely affected.

We license some of our important trademarks to third parties. For example, we license

Champion

to third parties for athletic-oriented accessories. Although we make concerted efforts to protect
our brands through quality control mechanisms and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees,
there is a risk that some licensees may not be in full compliance with those mechanisms and
obligations. In that event, or if a licensee engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks
that would cause us reputational harm, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand’s
business, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, any misuse of the

Wonderbra

or

Playtex

brands by Sun Capital could result in negative publicity and a loss of sales
for our products under these brands, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We design, manufacture, source and sell products under trademarks that are licensed from third
parties. If any licensor takes actions related to their trademarks that would cause their brands or
our company reputational harm, our business may be adversely affected.

We design, manufacture, source and sell a number of our products under trademarks that are
licensed from third parties such as our Polo Ralph Lauren men’s underwear. Because we do not
control the brands licensed to us, our licensors could make changes to their brands or business
models that could result in a significant downturn in a brand’s business, adversely affecting our
sales and results of operations. If any licensor engages in behavior with respect to the licensed
marks that would cause us reputational harm, or if any of the brands licensed to us violates the
trademark rights of another or are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, we could experience a
significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely affecting our sales and results of
operations, and we may be required to expend significant amounts on public relations, advertising
and, possibly, legal fees.

Businesses that we may acquire may fail to perform to expectations, and we may be unable to
successfully integrate acquired businesses with our existing business.

From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support and
strengthen our business. We may not be able to realize all or a substantial portion of the
anticipated benefits of acquisitions that we may consummate. Newly acquired businesses may not
achieve expected results of operations, including expected levels of revenues, and may require
unanticipated costs and expenditures. Acquired businesses may also subject us to liabilities that
we were unable to discover in the course of our due diligence, and our rights to indemnification
from the sellers of such businesses, even if obtained, may not be sufficient to offset the relevant
liabilities. In addition, the integration of newly acquired businesses may be expensive and
time-consuming and may not be entirely successful. Integration of the acquired businesses may also
place additional pressures on our systems of internal control over financial reporting. If we are
unable to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or if acquired businesses fail to
produce targeted results, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
condition.

Our historical financial information and operations for periods prior to the spin off are not
necessarily indicative of our results as a separate company and therefore may not be reliable as an
indicator of our future financial results.

Our historical financial statements for periods prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006
were created from Sara Lee’s financial statements using our historical results of operations and
historical bases of assets and liabilities as part of Sara Lee. Accordingly, historical financial
information for periods prior to the spin off is not necessarily indicative of what our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows would have been if we had been a separate,
stand alone entity during those periods. Our historical financial information for periods prior
to the spin off is also not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations, financial
position and cash flows will be in the future and, for periods prior to the spin off, does not
reflect many significant changes in our capital structure, funding and operations resulting from
the spin off. While our results of operations for periods prior to the spin off include all costs
of Sara Lee’s branded apparel business, these costs and expenses do not include all of the costs
that would have been incurred by us had we been an independent company during those periods. In
addition, we have
not made adjustments to our historical financial information to reflect changes, many of which
are significant, that occurred in our cost structure, financing and operations as a result of the
spin off, including the substantial debt we



incurred and pension liabilities we assumed in
connection with the spin off. In addition, our effective income tax rate as reflected in our
historical financial information for periods prior to the spin off has not been and may not be
indicative of our future effective income tax rate.

If the IRS determines that our spin off from Sara Lee does not qualify as a “tax-free” distribution
or a “tax-free” reorganization, we may be subject to substantial liability.

Sara Lee has received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the “IRS,”
to the effect that, among other things, the spin off qualifies as a tax-free distribution for U.S.
federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
the “Internal Revenue Code,” and as part of a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of
the Internal Revenue Code, and the transfer to us of assets and the assumption by us of liabilities
in connection with the spin off will not result in the recognition of any gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes to Sara Lee.

Although the private letter ruling relating to the qualification of the spin off under
Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code generally is binding on the IRS, the
continuing validity of the ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and
assumptions made in connection with obtaining such private letter ruling. Also, as part of the
IRS’s general policy with respect to rulings on spin off transactions under Section 355 of the
Internal Revenue Code, the private letter ruling obtained by Sara Lee is based upon representations
by Sara Lee that certain conditions which are necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under Section
355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code have been satisfied, rather than a
determination by the IRS that these conditions have been satisfied. Any inaccuracy in these
representations could invalidate the ruling.

If the spin off does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
then, in general, Sara Lee would be subject to tax as if it has sold the common stock of our
company in a taxable sale for its fair market value. Sara Lee’s stockholders would be subject to
tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of our common
stock that was distributed to them, taxed as a dividend (without reduction for any portion of a
Sara Lee’s stockholder’s basis in its shares of Sara Lee common stock) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and possibly for purposes of state and local tax law, to the extent of a Sara Lee’s
stockholder’s pro rata share of Sara Lee’s current and accumulated earnings and profits (including
any arising from the taxable gain to Sara Lee with respect to the spin off). It is expected that
the amount of any such taxes to Sara Lee’s stockholders and to Sara Lee would be substantial.

Pursuant to a tax sharing agreement we entered into with Sara Lee in connection with the spin
off, we agreed to indemnify Sara Lee and its affiliates for any liability for taxes of Sara Lee
resulting from: (1) any action or failure to act by us or any of our affiliates following the
completion of the spin off that would be inconsistent with or prohibit the spin off from qualifying
as a tax-free transaction to Sara Lee and to Sara Lee’s stockholders under Sections 355 and
368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, or (2) any action or failure to act by us or any of our
affiliates following the completion of the spin off that would be inconsistent with or cause to be
untrue any material, information, covenant or representation made in connection with the private
letter ruling obtained by Sara Lee from the IRS relating to, among other things, the qualification
of the spin off as a tax-free transaction described under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Our indemnification obligations to Sara Lee and its affiliates are not
limited in amount or subject to any cap. We expect that the amount of any such taxes to Sara Lee
would be substantial.

Anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws, as well as Maryland law and our stockholder
rights agreement, may reduce the likelihood of any potential change of control or unsolicited
acquisition proposal that you might consider favorable.

Our charter permits our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter
to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of
any class or series that we have the authority to issue. In addition, our board of directors may
classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the
preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers and other terms of
the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could establish a series of
preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a
change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the
best interest of our stockholders. Our board of directors also is permitted, without stockholder
approval, to implement a classified board structure at any time.



Our bylaws, which only can be amended by our board of directors, provide that nominations of
persons for election to our board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a
stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by our board of directors or by
a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice
procedures of our bylaws. Also, under Maryland law, business combinations between us and an
interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder, including mergers,
consolidations, share exchanges or, in circumstances specified in the statute, asset transfers or
issuances or reclassifications of equity securities, are prohibited for five years after the most
recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. An interested
stockholder includes any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our shares
or any affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date
in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our stock. A person is
not an interested stockholder under the statute if our board of directors approved in advance the
transaction by which he otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in
approving a transaction, our board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to
compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by our
board. After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between us and an interested
stockholder generally must be recommended by our board of directors and approved by two
supermajority votes or our common stockholders must receive a minimum price, as defined under
Maryland law, for their shares. The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions,
including business combinations that are exempted by our board of directors prior to the time that
the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.

In addition, we have adopted a stockholder rights agreement which provides that in the event
of an acquisition of or tender offer for 15% of our outstanding
common stock, our stockholders, other than the acquiror,
shall be granted rights to purchase our common stock at a certain price. The stockholder rights
agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire our common stock without the
approval of our board of directors.

These and other provisions of Maryland law or our charter and bylaws could have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium
price for our common stock or otherwise be considered favorably by our stockholders.

Item 2.

Properties

We own and lease properties supporting our administrative, manufacturing, distribution and
direct outlet activities. We own our approximately 470,000 square-foot headquarters located in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which houses our various sales, marketing and corporate business
functions. Research and development as well as certain product-design functions also are located in
Winston-Salem, while other design functions are located in New York City. Our products are
manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and
operated by third-party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for
us, such as cutting and/or sewing. We source the remainder of our finished goods from third-party
manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our designs.

As of January 3, 2009, we owned and leased properties in 23 countries, including 52
manufacturing facilities and 22 distribution centers, as well as office facilities. The leases for
these properties expire between January 4, 2009 and 2019, with the exception of some seasonal
warehouses that we lease on a month-by-month basis. For more information about our capital lease
obligations, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Future Contractual Obligations and Commitments.”

As of January 3, 2009, we also operated 213 direct outlet stores in 40 states, most of which
are leased under
five-year, renewable lease agreements. We believe that our facilities, as well as equipment,
are in good condition and meet our current business needs.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities

Market for our Common Stock

Our common stock currently is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or the “NYSE,”
under the symbol “HBI.” A “when-issued” trading market for our common stock on the NYSE began on
August 16, 2006, and “regular way” trading of our common stock began on September 6, 2006. Prior to
August 16, 2006, there was no public market for our common stock. Each share of our common stock
has attached to it one preferred stock purchase right. These rights initially will be transferable
with and only with the transfer of the underlying share of common stock. We have not made any
unregistered sales of our equity securities.

The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock for the
indicated periods:

Holders of Record

On February 2, 2009, there were 44,338 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of
the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of
stockholders, we are unable to determine the exact number of beneficial stockholders represented by
these record holders, but we believe that there were more than 98,000 beneficial owners of our
common stock as of February 2, 2009.

Dividends

We currently do not pay regular dividends on our outstanding stock. The declaration of any
future dividends and, if declared, the amount of any such dividends, will be subject to our actual
future earnings, capital requirements, regulatory restrictions, debt covenants, other contractual
restrictions and to the discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into
account such matters as general business conditions, our financial condition and results of
operations, our capital requirements, our prospects and such other factors as our board of
directors may deem relevant.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

There were no purchases by Hanesbrands during the quarter ended January 3, 2009 of equity
securities that are registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.

Performance Graph

The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with
the comparable cumulative return of the S&P MidCap 400 Index and the S&P 1500 Apparel, Accessories
& Luxury Goods Index. The graph assumes that $100 was invested in our common stock and each index on
August 11, 2006, the effective date of the registration of our common stock under Section 12 of the
Exchange Act, although a “when-issued” trading market for our common stock did not begin until
August 16, 2006, and “regular way” trading did not



begin until September 6, 2006. The stock price
performance on the following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN

Compliance with Certain New York Stock Exchange Requirements

As required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard A. Noll, our Chief Executive
Officer must certify to the New York Stock Exchange each year that he is not aware of any violation
by Hanesbrands of New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards as of the date of
his certification, qualifying the certification to the extent necessary. Mr. Noll’s certification
filed with the New York Stock Exchange on May 15, 2008 did not contain any qualifications. We are
filing, as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the certifications required by Section 302
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Item 6.

Selected Financial Data

The following table presents our selected historical financial data. The statement of
income data for the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, the six-month period ended
December 30, 2006 and the year ended July 1, 2006 and the balance sheet data as of January 3, 2009
and December 29, 2007 have been derived from our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statement of income data for the years ended July
2, 2005 and July 3, 2004 and the balance sheet data as of December 30, 2006, July 1, 2006, July 2,
2005 and July 3, 2004 has been derived from our consolidated financial statements not included in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In October 2006, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from
the Saturday closest to June 30 to the Saturday closest to December 31. As a result of this change,
our consolidated financial statements include presentation of the transition period beginning on
July 2, 2006 and ending on December 30, 2006.

Our historical financial data for periods prior to our spin off from Sara Lee on September 5,
2006 is not necessarily indicative of our future performance or what our financial position and
results of operations would have been if we had operated as a
separate, stand alone entity during
all of the periods shown. The data should be read in conjunction with our historical financial
statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

shares of our common stock outstanding, plus the potential dilution
that could occur if restricted stock units and options granted under
our equity-based compensation arrangements were exercised or converted
into common stock.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations, or MD&A, contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Please see “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a
discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. This
discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and related notes
thereto and the other disclosures contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On
October 26, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from the Saturday
closest to June 30 to the Saturday closest to December 31. We refer to the resulting transition
period from July 2, 2006 to December 30, 2006 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the six months
ended December 30, 2006. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not
necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods, and our actual results
may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various
factors, including but not limited to those listed under “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K and included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

MD&A is a supplement to our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and is provided to enhance your understanding of our
results of operations and financial condition. Our MD&A is organized as follows:

Overview

Our Company

We are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands, including

Hanes, Champion, C9 by Champion, Playtex, Bali, L’eggs, Just My Size, barely there

,

Wonderbra,
Stedman, Outer Banks, Zorba, Rinbros

and

Duofold.

We design, manufacture, source and sell a broad
range of apparel essentials such as t-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear, kids’ underwear,
casualwear, activewear, socks and hosiery.

According to NPD, our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S. market position by
sales value in most product categories in which we compete, for the 12 month period ended November
30, 2008. In 2008,

Hanes

was number one for the fifth consecutive year on the Women’s Wear Daily
“Top 100 Brands Survey” for apparel and accessory brands that women know best and was number one
for the fifth consecutive year as the most preferred men’s, women’s and children’s apparel brand of consumers in Retailing Today magazine’s “Top
Brands Study.” Additionally, the company had five of the top ten intimate apparel brands preferred
by consumers in the Retailing Today study —

Hanes, Playtex, Bali, Just My Size

and

L’eggs

.



Our distribution channels include direct to consumer sales at our outlet stores, national
chains and department stores and warehouse clubs, mass-merchandise outlets and international sales.
For the year ended January 3, 2009, approximately 44% of our net sales were to mass merchants, 18%
were to national chains and department stores, 9% were direct to consumers, 11% were in our
International segment and 18% were to other retail channels such as embellishers, specialty
retailers, warehouse clubs and sporting goods stores.

Our Segments

Our operations are managed in five operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment
for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Outerwear, International, Hosiery and Other. These
segments are organized principally by product category and geographic location. Management of each
segment is responsible for the operations of these businesses but share a common supply chain and
media and marketing platforms.



Business and Industry Trends

We are operating in an uncertain and volatile economic environment, which could have
unanticipated adverse effects on our business. The current retail environment has been impacted by
recent volatility in the financial markets, including declines in stock prices, and by uncertain
economic conditions. Increases in food and fuel prices, changes in the credit and housing markets
leading to the current financial and credit crisis, actual and potential job losses among many
sectors of the economy, significant declines in the stock market resulting in large losses to
consumer retirement and investment accounts, and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and
economic policies have all added to declines in consumer confidence and curtailed retail spending.

We expect the weak retail environment to continue and do not expect macroeconomic conditions
to be conducive to growth in 2009. Achieving financial results that compare favorably with
year-ago results will be challenging in the first half of 2009. In the first quarter of 2009, we
expect a sales decline that is more or less consistent with the fourth quarter 2008 trend and
reflects expected lower casualwear sales in the Outerwear segment primarily in the first half of
2009. We also expect substantial pressure on profitability due to the economic climate,
significantly higher commodity costs, increased pension costs and increased costs associated with
implementing our price increase that is not effective for the entire first quarter of 2009,
including repackaging costs.

The apparel essentials market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly. Competition
is generally based upon price, brand name recognition, product quality, selection, service and
purchasing convenience. The majority of our core styles continue from year to year, with variations
only in color, fabric or design details. Some products, however, such as intimate apparel,
activewear and sheer hosiery, do have an emphasis on style and innovation. Our businesses face
competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers, as well as smaller
companies, department stores, specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell apparel
essentials products under private labels that compete directly with our brands.

Our top ten customers accounted for 65% of our net sales and our top customer,
Wal-Mart, accounted for over $1.1 billion of our sales for the year ended January 3, 2009. Our
largest customers in the year ended January 3, 2009 were Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl’s, which
accounted for 27%, 16% and 6% of total sales, respectively. The growth in retailers can create
pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek to have greater concessions in their
purchase of our products, while they can be increasingly demanding that we provide them with some
of our products on an exclusive basis. To counteract these effects, it has become increasingly
important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as
our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in today’s challenging economic
environment. In addition, during the past several years, various retailers, including some of our
largest customers, have experienced significant difficulties, including restructurings,
bankruptcies and liquidations, and the ability of retailers to overcome these difficulties may
increase due to the recent deterioration of worldwide economic conditions.

Anticipating changes in and managing our operations in response to consumer preferences
remains an important element of our business. In recent years, we have experienced changes in our
net sales, revenues and cash flows in accordance with changes in consumer preferences and trends.
For example, we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall
decline in the industry and with shifts in consumer preferences. The Hosiery segment only comprised
5% of our net sales in the year ended January 3, 2009 however, and as a result, the decline in the
Hosiery segment has not had a significant impact on our net sales, revenues or cash flows.
Generally, we manage the Hosiery segment for cash, placing an emphasis on reducing our cost
structure and managing cash efficiently.

Our Key Business Strategies

Sell more, spend less and generate cash are our broad strategies to build our brands,
reduce our costs and generate cash.

Sell More

Through our “sell more” strategy, we seek to drive profitable growth by consistently offering
consumers brands they love and trust and products with unsurpassed value. Key initiatives we are
employing to implement this strategy include:



•

Build big, strong brands in big core categories with innovative key items.

Our ability
to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success. Our design,
research and product development teams, in partnership with our marketing teams, drive our
efforts to bring innovations to market. We seek to leverage our insights into consumer
demand in the apparel essentials industry to develop new products within our existing lines
and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing, addressing
changing customer needs and industry trends. We also support our key brands with targeted,
effective advertising and marketing campaigns.

•

Foster strategic partnerships with key retailers via “team selling.”

We foster
relationships with key retailers by applying our extensive category and product knowledge,
leveraging our use of multi-functional customer management teams and developing new
customer-specific programs such as

C9 by Champion

for Target. Our goal is to strengthen and
deepen our existing strategic relationships with retailers and develop new strategic
relationships.

•

Use Kanban concepts to have the right products available in the right quantities at the
right time.

Through Kanban, a multi-initiative effort that determines production
quantities, and in doing so, facilitates just-in-time production and ordering systems, we
seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively
managing inventory levels.

Spend Less

Through our “spend less” strategy, we seek to become an integrated organization that leverages
its size and global reach to reduce costs, improve flexibility and provide a high level of service.
Key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include:

•

Globalizing our supply chain by balancing across hemispheres into “economic” clusters
with fewer, larger facilities.

As a provider of high-volume products, we are continually
seeking to improve our cost-competitiveness and operating flexibility through supply chain
initiatives. Through our consolidation and globalization strategy, which is discussed in
more detail below, we will continue to transition additional parts of our supply chain to
lower-cost locations in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin in an effort to
optimize our cost structure. As part of this process, we are using Kanban concepts to
optimize the way we manage demand, to increase manufacturing flexibility to better respond
to demand variability and to simplify our finished goods and the raw materials we use to
produce them. We expect that these changes in our supply chain will result in significant
cost efficiencies and increased asset utilization.

•

Leverage our global purchasing and manufacturing scale.

Historically, we have had a
decentralized operating structure with many distinct operating units. We are in the process
of consolidating purchasing, manufacturing and sourcing across all of our product
categories in the United States. We believe that these initiatives will streamline our
operations, improve our inventory management, reduce costs and standardize processes.

Generate Cash

Through our “generate cash” strategy, we seek to effectively generate and invest cash at or
above our weighted average cost of capital to provide superior returns for both our equity and debt
investors. Key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include:

•

Optimizing our capital structure to take advantage of our business model’s strong and
consistent cash flows.

Maintaining appropriate debt leverage and utilizing excess cash to,
for example, pay down debt, invest in our own stock and selectively pursue strategic
acquisitions are keys to building a stronger business and generating additional value for
investors.

•

Continuing to improve turns for accounts receivables, inventory, accounts payable and
fixed assets.

Our ability to generate cash is enhanced through more efficient management of
accounts receivables, inventory, accounts payable and fixed assets.



Consolidation and Globalization Strategy

We expect to continue our restructuring efforts as we continue to execute our consolidation
and globalization strategy. We have closed plant locations, reduced our workforce, and relocated
some of our manufacturing capacity to lower cost locations in Asia, Central America and the
Caribbean Basin. For example, during the year ended January 3, 2009, in furtherance of our
consolidation and globalization strategy, we approved actions to close 11 manufacturing facilities
and three distribution centers and eliminate
approximately 6,800 positions in Mexico, the United States, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador.
In addition, approximately 200 management and administrative positions were
eliminated, with the majority of these positions based in the United States. We also have
recognized accelerated depreciation with respect to owned or leased assets associated with
manufacturing facilities and distribution centers which closed during 2008 or we anticipate closing
in the next several years as part of our consolidation and globalization strategy. While we believe
that this strategy has had and will continue to have a beneficial impact on our operational
efficiency and cost structure, we have incurred significant costs to implement these initiatives.
In particular, we have recorded charges for severance and other employment-related obligations
relating to workforce reductions, as well as payments in connection with lease and other contract
terminations. In addition, we incurred charges for one-time write-offs of stranded raw materials
and work in process inventory determined not to be salvageable or cost-effective to relocate
related to the closure of manufacturing facilities. These amounts are included in the “Cost of
sales,” “Restructuring” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” lines of our statements
of income.

Our significant supply chain capital spending and acquisition actions during 2008 include:

•

During the second quarter of 2008, we added three company-owned sewing plants in
Southeast Asia — two in Vietnam and one in Thailand — giving us four sewing plants in
Asia.

•

In October 2008, we acquired a 370-employee embroidery facility in Honduras. For the
past eight years, these operations have produced embroidered and screen-printed apparel for
us. This acquisition better positions us for long-term growth in these segments.

•

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we commenced production at our 500,000 square foot
socks manufacturing facility in El Salvador. This facility, co-located with textile
manufacturing operations that we acquired in 2007, provides a manufacturing base in Central
America from which to leverage our production scale at a lower cost location.

•

We continued construction of a textile production plant in Nanjing, China, which will be
our first company-owned textile production facility in Asia. We expect production to
commence in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Nanjing textile facility will enable us to
expand and leverage our production scale in Asia as we balance our supply chain across
hemispheres.

We have made significant progress in our multiyear goal of generating gross savings
that could approach or exceed $200 million. As a result of the restructuring actions taken since
our spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006, our cost structure was reduced and efficiencies
improved, generating savings of $62 million during the year ended January 3, 2009. In addition to
the saving generated from restructuring actions, we benefited from $14 million in savings related
to other cost reduction initiatives during the year ended January 3, 2009. Of the seven
manufacturing facilities and distribution centers approved for closure in 2006, two were closed in
2006 and five were closed in 2007. Of the 19 manufacturing facilities and distribution centers
approved for closure in 2007, 10 were closed in 2007 and nine were closed in 2008. Of the 14
manufacturing facilities and distribution centers approved for closure in 2008, nine were closed in
2008 and five are expected to close in 2009. For more information about our restructuring actions,
see Note 5, titled “Restructuring” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

The continued implementation of our globalization and consolidation strategy, which is
designed to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs, has resulted and is likely to continue
to result in significant costs in the short-term and generate savings as well as higher inventory
levels for the next 12 to 15 months. As further plans are developed and approved, we expect to
recognize additional restructuring costs as we eliminate duplicative functions within the
organization and transition a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to lower-cost
locations. As a result of this strategy, we expect to incur approximately $250 million in
restructuring and related charges over the three year period following the spin off from Sara Lee
on September 5, 2006, of which approximately half is



expected to be noncash. As of January 3, 2009,
we have recognized approximately $209 million and announced approximately $219 million in
restructuring and related charges related to these efforts since September 5, 2006. Of these
charges, approximately $84 million relates to accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment
for facilities that have been or will be closed, approximately $79 million relates to employee
termination and other benefits, approximately $19 million relates to write-offs of stranded raw
materials and work in process inventory determined not to be salvageable or cost-effective to
relocate, approximately $17 million relates to lease termination and other costs and approximately
$10 million related to impairments of fixed assets.

Seasonality and Other Factors

Our operating results are subject to some variability. Generally, our diverse range of
product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. Sales
are typically higher in the last two quarters (July to December) of each fiscal year. Socks,
hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during this period as a result of cooler
weather, back-to-school shopping and holidays. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by
customers’ decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated
consumer demand. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of
products ordered with minimal notice to us. For example, we experienced a shift in timing by our
largest retail customers of back-to-school programs from June to July in 2008. Our results of
operations are also impacted by fluctuations and volatility in the price of cotton and oil-related
materials and the timing of actual spending for our media, advertising and promotion expenses.
Media, advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year
depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product
introductions.

Although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by
consumers on a planned, rather than on an impulse, basis, our sales are impacted by discretionary
spending by our customers. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors, including, among
others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the
availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, electricity power rates,
gasoline prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and
spending. Many of these factors are outside of our control. Our customers’ purchases of
discretionary items, including our products, could decline during periods when disposable income is
lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived
unfavorable economic conditions. These consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or
lower-priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products, or may
choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our domestic price increases that become
effective from time to time.

Inflation and Changing Prices

Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor
may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, a significant portion of our
products are manufactured in other countries and a further decline in the value of the U.S. dollar
may result in higher manufacturing costs. Similarly, the cost of the materials that are used in our
manufacturing process, such as oil related commodity prices, rose during the summer of 2008 as a
result of inflation and other factors. In addition, inflation often is accompanied by higher
interest rates, which could have a negative impact on spending, in which case our margins could
decrease. Moreover, increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in income, which also could
have a negative impact on spending. If we incur increased costs that are unable to be recouped, or
if consumer spending continues to decrease generally, our business, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected. In an effort to mitigate the impact
of these incremental costs on our operating results, we informed our retail customers during 2008
that we would be raising domestic prices effective during the first quarter of 2009. We are
implementing an average gross price increase of four percent in our domestic product categories.
The range of price increases varies by individual product category.

Our costs for cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of
cotton, which is affected by weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the
relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that
are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. While we do enter into short-term supply
agreements and hedges from time to time in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility
of the market price of cotton, our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices,
although cotton represents only 8% of our cost of sales. Cotton prices were 65 cents per pound for
the year ended January 3, 2009 and 56 cents per pound for the year ended December 29, 2007. The
price of cotton currently in our inventory is in the mid 60 cents per pound range which is



the price that will impact our operating results in the first half of 2009. The prices for the most
recent cotton crop, which will impact our operating results in the second half of 2009, have
decreased to the low 50 cents per pound range. In addition, during the summer of 2008 we
experienced a spike in oil related commodity prices and other raw materials used in our products,
such as dyes and chemicals, and increases in other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs.
Further discussion of the market sensitivity of cotton is included in “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk.”

Components of Net Sales and Expense

Net sales

We generate net sales by selling apparel essentials such as t-shirts, bras, panties, men’s
underwear, kids’ underwear, socks, hosiery, casualwear and activewear. Our net sales are recognized
net of discounts, coupons, rebates, volume-based incentives and cooperative advertising costs. We
recognize revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii) the sales price is
fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer
and (iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, which occurs primarily upon shipment.
Net sales include an estimate for returns and allowances based upon historical return experience.
We also offer a variety of sales incentives to resellers and consumers that are recorded as
reductions to net sales.

Cost of sales

Our cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing finished goods, which consists of labor,
raw materials such as cotton and petroleum-based products and overhead costs such as depreciation
on owned facilities and equipment. Our cost of sales also includes finished goods sourced from
third-party manufacturers that supply us with products based on our designs as well as charges for
slow moving or obsolete inventories. Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from
a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory
item is sold. Our costs of sales do not include shipping costs, comprised of payments to third
party shippers, or handling costs, comprised of warehousing costs in our distribution facilities,
and thus our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities that include such costs
in cost of sales.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses include selling, advertising, costs of
shipping, handling and distribution to our customers, research and development, rent on leased
facilities, depreciation on owned facilities and equipment and other general and administrative
expenses. Also included for periods presented prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006 are
allocations of corporate expenses that consist of expenses for business insurance, medical
insurance, employee benefit plan amounts and, because we were part of Sara Lee those periods,
allocations from Sara Lee for certain centralized administration costs for treasury, real estate,
accounting, auditing, tax, risk management, human resources and benefits administration. These
allocations of centralized administration costs were determined on bases that we and Sara Lee
considered to be reasonable and take into consideration and include relevant operating profit,
fixed assets, sales and payroll. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include
management payroll, benefits, travel, information systems, accounting, insurance and legal
expenses.

Restructuring

We have from time to time closed facilities and reduced headcount, including in connection
with previously announced restructuring and business transformation plans. We refer to these activities as
restructuring actions. When we decide to close facilities or reduce headcount, we take estimated
charges for such restructuring, including charges for exited non-cancelable leases and other
contractual obligations, as well as severance and benefits. If the actual charge is different from
the original estimate, an adjustment is recognized in the period such change in estimate is
identified.



Other (income) expenses

Our other (income) expenses include charges such as losses on early extinguishment of debt and
certain other non-operating items.

Interest expense, net

As part of the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006, we incurred $2.6 billion
of debt. Since the spin off, we have made changes in our financing structuring and have made net
principal payments of $423 million of debt. In December 2006, we issued $500 million of Floating
Rate Senior Notes and the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the debt incurred at the spin
off. In November 2007, we entered into the Receivables Facility which provides for up to $250
million in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing, all of which we borrowed and used to repay
a portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facility. In addition, we have amended the terms of our
Senior Secured Credit Facility and Second Lien Credit Facility to provide more flexibility to
change our financial structure in the future.

Our interest expense is net of interest income. Interest income is the return we earned on our
cash and cash equivalents and, historically, on money we loaned to Sara Lee as part of its
corporate cash management practices. Our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Income tax expense (benefit)

Our effective income tax rate fluctuates from period to period and can be materially impacted
by, among other things:

•

changes in the mix of our earnings from the various jurisdictions in which we operate;

•

the tax characteristics of our earnings;

•

the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we repatriate to the
United States, which may increase our tax expense and taxes paid; and

•

the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing positions in the
jurisdictions in which we transact business.

Highlights from the Year Ended January 3, 2009



•

We repurchased $30 million of company stock during the year ended January 3, 2009.

•

We ended 2008 with $463 million of borrowing availability under our $500 million
revolving loan facility (the “Revolving Loan Facility”), $67 million in cash and cash
equivalents and $67 million of borrowing availability under our international loan
facilities, compared to $430 million, $174 million and $89 million, respectively, at the
end of 2007.

Consolidated net sales were lower by $226 million or 5% in 2008 compared to 2007
primarily due to weak sales at retail, which reflect a difficult economic and retail environment in
which the ultimate consumers of our products have been significantly limiting their discretionary
spending and visiting retail stores less frequently. The economic recession continued to impact
consumer spending, resulting in one of the worst holiday shopping seasons in 40 years as retail
sales fell for the sixth straight month in December. Our Innerwear, Outerwear, Hosiery and Other
segment net sales were lower by $154 million (6%), $41 million (3%), $38 million (14%) and $35
million (62%), respectively, and were partially offset by higher net sales in our International
segment of $38 million (9%). Although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and
tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned, rather than on an impulse, basis, weakness in the
retail environment can impact our results in the short-term, as it did in 2008. The total impact
of the 53

rd

week in 2008, which is included in the amounts above, was a $54 million
increase in sales.

The lower net sales in our Innerwear segment were primarily due to a decline in the
intimate apparel, socks, thermals and sleepwear product categories. Total intimate apparel net sales were $102 million
lower in 2008 compared to 2007. We experienced lower intimate apparel sales in our smaller brands
(

barely there

,

Just My Size

and

Wonderbra

) of $49 million, our

Hanes

brand of $42 million and our
private label brands of $10 million which we believe was primarily attributable to weaker sales at
retail as noted above. In 2008 compared to 2007, our

Playtex

brand intimate apparel net sales were
higher by $10 million and our

Bali

brand intimate apparel net sales were lower by $11 million. Net
sales in our male underwear product category were $8 million lower, which includes



the impact of exiting a license arrangement for a boys’ character underwear program in early 2008 that lowered
sales by $15 million. In addition, net sales of socks, thermals and sleepwear product categories
were lower in 2008 compared to 2007 by $32 million, $10 million and $4 million, respectively.

In our Outerwear segment, net sales of our

Champion

brand activewear were $34 million
higher in 2008 compared to 2007, and were offset by lower net sales of our casualwear product
categories of $79 million. Net sales in our Hosiery segment declined substantially more than the
long-term trend primarily due to lower sales of the

Hanes

brand to national chains and department
stores and our

L’eggs

brand to mass retailers and food and drug stores in 2008 compared to 2007. We
expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the
industry and with shifts in consumer preferences.

The overall lower net sales were partially offset by higher net sales in our
International segment that were driven by a favorable impact of $22 million related to foreign
currency exchange rates and by the growth in our casualwear businesses in Europe and Asia. The
favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates was primarily due to the strengthening of the
Japanese yen, Euro and Brazilian real.

The decline in net sales for our Other segment is primarily due to the continued vertical
integration of a yarn and fabric operation acquisition from 2006 with less focus on sales of
nonfinished fabric and yarn to third parties. We expect this decline to continue and sales for this
segment to ultimately become insignificant to us as we complete the implementation of our
consolidation and globalization efforts.

As a percent of net sales, our gross profit percentage was 32.4% in 2008 compared to
32.2% in 2007. While the gross profit percentage was higher, gross profit dollars were lower due to
lower sales volume of $85 million, unfavorable product sales mix of $35 million, higher cotton
costs of $30 million, higher production costs of $20 million related to higher energy and oil
related costs including freight costs and other vendor price increases of $12 million. The cotton
prices reflected in our results were 65 cents per pound in 2008 as compared to 56 cents per pound
in 2007. Energy and oil related costs were higher due to a spike in oil related commodity prices
during the summer of 2008. Our results will continue to reflect higher costs for cotton and oil
related materials until these costs cease to be reflected on our balance sheet in the first half of
2009 and we will start to benefit in the second half of 2009 from lower commodity costs. In
addition, in connection with the consolidation and globalization of our supply chain, we incurred
one-time restructuring related write-offs of stranded raw materials and work in process inventory
determined not to be salvageable or cost-effective to relocate of $19 million in 2008, which were
offset by lower accelerated depreciation of $13 million.

These higher expenses were primarily offset by savings from our cost reduction initiatives and
prior restructuring actions of $41 million, lower other manufacturing overhead costs of $24 million
primarily related to better volumes earlier in the year, lower on-going excess and obsolete
inventory costs of $14 million, lower sales incentives of $11 million, $10 million of lower duty
costs primarily related to higher refunds of $9 million, a $9 million favorable impact related to
foreign currency exchange rates, $8 million of favorable one-time out of period cost recognition
related to the capitalization of certain inventory supplies to be on a consistent basis across all
business lines, $4 million of lower start-up and shut down costs associated with our consolidation
and globalization of our supply chain and higher product sales pricing of $3 million. Our duty refunds were
higher in 2008 primarily due to the final passage of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United
States Free Trade Agreement in Costa Rica as a result of which we can, on a one-time basis, recover
duties paid since January 1, 2004 totaling approximately $15 million. The lower excess and obsolete
inventory costs in 2008 are attributable to both our continuous evaluation of inventory levels and
simplification of our product category offerings since the spin off. We realized the benefits of
driving down obsolete inventory levels through aggressive management and promotions and realized
the benefits from decreases in style counts ranging from 7% to 30% in our various product category
offerings. The quality of our inventory remained good with obsolete inventory down 23% from last
year. The favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact in our International segment was
primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen, Euro and Brazilian real.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $31 million lower in 2008
compared to 2007. Our cost reduction efforts resulted in lower expenses in 2008 compared to 2007
related to savings of $21 million from our prior restructuring actions for compensation and related
benefits, lower consulting expenses related to various areas of $5 million, lower non-media related
media, advertising and promotion expenses (“MAP”) expenses of $3 million, lower accelerated
depreciation of $3 million, lower postretirement healthcare and life insurance expense of $2
million and lower stock compensation expense of $2 million.

Our media related MAP expenses were $11 million lower in 2008 as compared to 2007. While our
spending for media related MAP was down in 2008, it was the second highest spending level in our
history. We supported our key brands with targeted, effective advertising and marketing campaigns
such as the launch of

Hanes No Ride Up Panties

and marketing initiatives for

Champion

and

Playtex

in the first half of 2008 and significantly lowered our overall spending during the second half of
2008. In contrast, in 2007, our media related MAP spending was spread across multiple product
categories and brands. MAP expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending
on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions.

In addition, spin off and related charges of $3 million recognized in 2007 did not recur in
2008. Our pension income of $12 million was higher by $9 million, which included an adjustment that
reduced pension expense in 2007 related to the final separation of our pension assets and
liabilities from those of Sara Lee.

We experienced higher bad debt expense of $7 million primarily related to the Mervyn’s
bankruptcy, higher computer software amortization costs of $5 million, higher technology consulting
and related expenses of $4 million and higher distribution expenses of $4 million in 2008 compared
to 2007. The higher technology consulting and computer software amortization costs are related to
our efforts to integrate our information technology systems across our company which involves
reducing the number of information technology platforms serving our business functions. The higher
distribution expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 were primarily related to higher volumes in our
international business, higher postage and freight costs and higher rework expenses in our
distribution centers. We also incurred higher expenses of $3 million in 2008 compared to 2007 as a
result of opening 10 retail stores over the last 12 months. In addition, we incurred $7 million in
amortization of gain on curtailment of postretirement benefits in 2007 which did not recur in 2008.

In December 2006, we notified retirees and employees of the phase out of premium subsidies for
early retiree medical coverage and move to an access-only plan for early retirees by the end of
2007. In December 2007, in connection with the termination of the postretirement medical plan, we
recognized a final gain on curtailment of plan benefits of $32 million. Concurrently with the
termination of the existing plan, we established a new access only plan that is fully paid by the

During 2008, we approved actions to close 11 manufacturing facilities and three
distribution centers and eliminate approximately 6,800 positions in Mexico,
the United States, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador. The production capacity represented by the manufacturing
facilities has been relocated to lower cost locations in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean
Basin. The distribution capacity has been relocated to our West Coast distribution facility in
California in order to expand capacity for goods we source from Asia. In addition, approximately
200 management and administrative positions were eliminated, with the majority of these positions
based in the United States. We recorded a charge of $34 million related to employee termination
and other benefits recognized in accordance with benefit plans previously communicated to the
affected employee group, fixed asset impairment charges of $9 million and charges related to
exiting supply contracts of $11 million, which was partially offset by $4 million of favorable
settlements of contract obligations for lower amounts than previously estimated.

In 2008, we recorded $19 million in one-time write-offs of stranded raw materials and
work in process inventory determined not to be salvageable or cost-effective to relocate related to
the closure of manufacturing facilities in the “Cost of sales” line. In addition, in connection
with our consolidation and globalization strategy, in 2008 and 2007, we recognized non-cash charges
of $24 million and $37 million, respectively, in the “Cost of sales” line and a non-cash charge of
$3 million in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line in 2007 related to
accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment for facilities that have been closed or will be
closed.

These actions, which are a continuation of our consolidation and globalization
strategy, are expected to result in benefits of moving production to lower-cost manufacturing
facilities, leveraging our large scale in high-volume products and consolidating production
capacity.

During 2007, we incurred $44 million in restructuring charges which primarily related to a
charge of $32 million related to employee termination and other benefits associated with plant
closures approved during that period and the elimination of certain management and administrative
positions, a $10 million charge for estimated lease termination costs associated with facility
closures and a $2 million impairment charge associated with facility closures.

partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses of $31 million. The lower

which exceeded our savings from executing our consolidation and globalization strategy during 2008.

Credit Facility for the prepayment of $125 million of principal in December 2008. During 2007, we
recognized losses on early extinguishment of debt related to unamortized debt issuance costs on the
Senior Secured Credit Facility for prepayments of $428 million of principal in 2007, including a
prepayment of $250 million that was made in connection with funding from the Receivables Facility

Interest expense, net was lower by $44 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The lower
interest expense is primarily attributable to a lower weighted average interest rate, $32 million
of which resulted from a lower London Interbank Offered Rate, or “LIBOR,” and $4 million of which
resulted from reduced interest rates achieved through changes in our financing structure such as
the February 2007 amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility that
we entered into in November 2007. In addition, interest expense was reduced by $8 million as a
result of our net prepayments of long-term debt during 2007 and 2008 of $303 million. Our weighted
average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 6.09% during 2008 compared to 7.74% in 2007.

At January 3, 2009, we had outstanding interest rate hedging arrangements whereby we have
capped the interest rate on $400 million of our floating rate debt at 3.50% and had fixed the
interest rate on $1.4 billion of our floating rate debt at 4.16%. Approximately 82% of our total
debt outstanding at January 3, 2009 was at a fixed or capped LIBOR rate.

Our annual effective income tax rate was 22.0% in 2008 compared to 31.5% in 2007. The lower
income tax expense is attributable primarily to lower pre-tax income and a lower effective income
tax rate. The lower effective income tax rate is primarily due to higher unremitted earnings from
foreign subsidiaries in 2008 taxed at rates less than the U.S. statutory rate. Our annual effective
tax rate reflects our strategic initiative to make substantial capital investments outside the
United States in our global supply chain in 2008.

Overall net sales in the Innerwear segment were lower by $154 million or 6% in 2008
compared to 2007. The difficult economic and retail environment significantly impacted consumers’
discretionary spending which resulted in lower sales in our intimate apparel, socks, thermals and
sleepwear product categories. Total intimate apparel net sales were $102 million lower in 2008
compared to 2007. We experienced lower intimate apparel sales in our smaller brands (

barely there

,

Just My Size

and

Wonderbra

) of $49 million, our

Hanes

brand of $42 million and our private label
brands of $10 million which we believe was primarily attributable to weaker sales at retail. In
2008 compared to 2007, our

Playtex

brand intimate apparel net sales were higher by $10 million and
our

Bali

brand intimate apparel net sales were lower by $11 million. The growth in our

Playtex

brand sales was supported by successful marketing initiatives in the first half of 2008. Net sales
in our male underwear product category were $8 million lower, which includes the impact of exiting
a license arrangement for a boys’ character underwear program in early 2008 that lowered sales by
$15 million. The lower net sales in our socks product category reflects a decline in kids’ and
men’s

Hanes

brand net sales of $19 million and

Champion

brand net sales of $11 million primarily
related to the loss of a men’s program for one of our customers. In addition, net sales of thermals
and sleepwear product categories were lower in 2008 compared to 2007 by $10 million and $4 million,
respectively. The total impact of the 53

rd

week in 2008, which is included in the
amounts above, was a $34 million increase in sales for the Innerwear segment.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage in the Innerwear segment
was 36.9% in 2008 compared to 36.8% in 2007. While the gross profit percentage was higher, gross
profit dollars were lower due to lower sales volume of $67 million, unfavorable product sales mix
of $28 million, higher cotton costs of $12 million, higher production costs of $10 million related
to higher energy and oil related costs including freight costs, other vendor price increases of $7
million and lower product sales pricing of $4 million. These higher costs were offset by savings
from our cost reduction initiatives and prior restructuring actions of $27 million, lower sales
incentives of $21 million, $11 million of lower duty costs primarily related to higher refunds and
$8 million of favorable one-time out of period cost recognition related to the capitalization of
certain inventory supplies to be on a consistent basis across all business lines. In addition, we
incurred lower on-going excess and obsolete inventory costs of $8 million arising from realizing
the benefits of driving down obsolete inventory levels through aggressive management and promotions
and simplifying our product category offerings which reduced our style counts ranging from 7% to
30% in our various product category offerings.

The lower Innerwear segment operating profit in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily
attributable to lower gross profit and higher bad debt expense of $4 million primarily related to
the Mervyn’s bankruptcy. We also incurred higher expenses of $3 million in 2008 compared to 2007
as a result of opening 10 retail stores over the last 12 months. These higher costs were partially
offset by savings of $15 million from prior restructuring actions primarily for compensation and
related benefits, lower media related MAP expenses of $8 million and lower non-media related MAP
expenses of $7 million. A significant portion of the selling, general and administrative expenses
in each segment is an allocation of our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses,
however certain expenses that are specifically identifiable to a segment are charged directly to
each segment. The allocation methodology for the consolidated selling, general and administrative
expenses for 2008 is consistent with 2007. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative
expenses before segment allocations was $31 million lower in 2008 compared to 2007.

Net sales in the Outerwear segment were lower by $41 million or 3% in 2008 compared to
2007, primarily as a result of higher net sales of

Champion

brand activewear of $34 million offset
by lower net sales of retail casualwear of $55 million and lower net sales through our
embellishment channel of $24 million, primarily in promotional t-shirts and sportshirts. Our

Champion

brand sales continue to benefit from our investment in the brand through our marketing
initiatives. Our “How You Play” marketing campaign has received a very positive response from
consumers. The lower retail casualwear net sales of $55 million reflect a $6 million impact related
to the loss of seasonal programs continuing into the first half of 2009. We expect the impact on
2009 net sales of losing these programs, which consist of recurring seasonal programs that were
renewed in prior years but were not renewed for 2009, to occur primarily in the first half of 2009;
losses may be offset by any new seasonal programs we may add. The total impact of the

rd

week in 2008, which is included in the amounts above, was a $14 million increase in
sales for the Outerwear segment.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage in the Outerwear segment
was 22.1% in 2008 compared to 21.6% in 2007. While the gross profit percentage was higher, gross
profit dollars were lower due to higher cotton costs of $18 million, higher production costs of $10
million related to higher energy and oil related costs including freight costs, lower sales volume
of $9 million, higher sales incentives of $8 million and other vendor price increases of $3
million. These higher costs were partially offset by lower other manufacturing overhead costs of
$23 million, savings of $11 million from our cost reduction initiatives and prior restructuring
actions, higher product sales pricing of $7 million, lower on-going excess and obsolete inventory
costs of $2 million and favorable product sales mix of $2 million.

The lower Outerwear segment operating profit in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily
attributable to lower gross profit, higher distribution expenses of $5 million, higher technology
consulting and related expenses of $3 million, higher non-media related MAP expenses of $3 million
and higher bad debt expense of $2 million primarily related to the Mervyn’s bankruptcy. These
higher costs were partially offset by savings of $6 million from our cost reduction initiatives and

consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses, however certain expenses that are

Overall net sales in the International segment were higher by $38 million or 9% in

impact of foreign currency and the 53

rd

week, in Europe of $20 million, Asia of $18
million and Canada of $2 million. The growth in our European casualwear business was driven by the
strength of the

Stedman

brand that is sold in the embellishment channel. Higher sales in our

Champion

brand casualwear business in Asia and our

Champion

and

Hanes

brands male underwear business in Canada also contributed to the sales growth. Changes in foreign currency
exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of $22 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The
favorable impact was primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen, Euro and Brazilian
real. The total impact of the 53

the International segment.



As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage was 40.8% in 2008 compared
to 2007 at 41.3%. While the gross profit percentage was lower, gross profit dollars were higher for
2008 compared to 2007 as a result of a favorable impact related to foreign currency exchange rates
of $9 million, favorable product sales mix of $7 million and lower on-going excess and obsolete
inventory costs of $3 million partially offset by higher sales incentives of $6 million.

The higher International segment operating profit in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily
attributable to the higher gross profit partially offset by higher distribution expenses of $3
million, higher media-related MAP expenses of $2 million and higher non-media related MAP expenses
of $2 million. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which are included in the impact on
gross profit above, had a favorable impact on segment operating profit of $4 million in 2008

and

DKNY

license agreement and lower sales of our

Just My Size

brand of $3 million. We expect the trend of
declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry and with
shifts in consumer preferences. Generally, we manage the Hosiery segment for cash, placing an
emphasis on reducing our cost structure and managing cash efficiently. The total impact of the

rd

week in 2008, which is included in the amounts above, was a $4 million increase in
sales for the Hosiery segment.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage was 47.1% in 2008 compared to 47.2%
in 2007. The lower gross profit percentage for 2008 compared to 2007 is the result of unfavorable
product sales mix of $17 million and lower sales volume of $10 million, offset by savings of $4
million from our cost reduction initiatives and prior restructuring actions, lower sales incentives
of $4 million and lower other manufacturing overhead costs of $2 million.

The lower Hosiery segment operating profit in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable
to lower gross profit partially offset by lower distribution expenses of $5 million, savings of $2
million from our cost reduction initiatives and prior restructuring actions, lower non-media
related MAP expenses of $2 million and lower spending of $3 million in numerous areas. A
significant portion of the selling, general and administrative expenses in each segment is an
allocation of our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses, however certain
expenses that are specifically identifiable to a segment are charged directly to each segment. The
allocation methodology for the consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses for 2008
is consistent with 2007. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses before
segment allocations was $31 million lower in 2008 compared to 2007.

The decline in net sales in our Other segment is primarily due to the continued vertical
integration of a yarn and fabric operation acquisition from 2006 with less focus on sales of
nonfinished fabric and yarn to third parties. We expect this decline to continue and sales for this
segment to ultimately become insignificant to us as we complete the



implementation of our consolidation and globalization efforts. Net sales in this segment are
generated for the purpose of maintaining asset utilization at certain manufacturing facilities and
generating break even margins.

General Corporate Expenses

General corporate expenses were lower in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to $11 million of
higher foreign exchange transaction gains, $6 million of higher gains on sales of assets, $3
million of lower start-up and shut-down costs associated with our consolidation and globalization
of our supply chain and $3 million of spin off and related charges recognized in 2007 which did not
recur in 2008. These lower expenses were partially offset by $7 million in amortization of gain on
curtailment of postretirement benefits in 2007 which did not recur in 2008, $7 million in losses
from foreign currency derivatives and a $3 million adjustment that reduced pension expense in 2007
related to the final separation of our pension assets and liabilities from those of Sara Lee.

Consolidated net sales were higher by $71 million or 2% in 2007 compared to 2006. Our
Outerwear, International and Other segment net sales were higher by $68 million (6%), $22 million
(5%) and $12 million (27%), respectively, and were offset by lower segment net sales in Innerwear
of $18 million (1%) and Hosiery of $12 million (4%).

The overall higher net sales were primarily due to double digit growth in sales volume
in

Champion

brand sales, growth in

Hanes

brand casualwear, socks, sleepwear, intimate apparel and
men’s underwear sales and

Bali

brand intimate apparel sales. Our

Champion

brand sales have
increased by double-digits in each of the last three years. The higher net sales were offset
primarily by lower sales of promotional t-shirts sold primarily through our embellishment channel,
lower

Playtex

brand intimate apparel sales, lower

Hanes

brand kids’ underwear sales and lower
licensed men’s underwear sales in the department store channel.

Our strategy of investing in our largest and strongest brands generated growth in
2007. In 2007, we launched a number of new advertising and marketing initiatives for our top
brands, including our

Hanes ComfortSoft

campaigns,

Bali Passion for Comfort

,

Playtex

“Girl Talk”
and most recently our

Champion

“How you Play” advertising campaign which is the first campaign for
the brand since 2003. We also announced a 10-year strategic alliance with The Walt Disney Company
that includes basic apparel exclusivity for the

Hanes

and

Champion

brands, product co-branding,
attraction sponsorships and other brand visibility and signage at Disney properties. The alliance
included the naming rights for the stadium at Disney’s Wide World of Sports Complex, now known as

Champion

Stadium.

Net sales in the Hosiery segment were lower primarily due to lower sales of the

L’eggs

brand to mass retailers and food and drug stores. We expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to
continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry and with shifts in consumer
preferences. The higher net sales from our Other segment primarily resulted from an immaterial
change in the way we recognized sales to third party suppliers in 2006. The full year change was
reflected in 2006 with a $5 million impact on net sales and minimal impact on net income.

The changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of $15
million in 2007 compared to 2006.

As a percent of net sales, our gross profit percentage was 32.2% in 2007 compared to
32.8% in 2006. The lower gross profit percentage was primarily due to higher cotton costs of $21
million, higher excess and obsolete inventory costs of $21 million, $16 million of higher
accelerated depreciation, $16 million of unfavorable product sales mix and $13 million of higher
start-up and shut down costs associated with the consolidation and globalization of our supply
chain. In addition, gross profit was negatively impacted by higher incentives of $14 million of
which $16 million resulted from a change in the classification of certain sales incentives in 2007
which were previously classified as media, advertising and promotion expenses in 2006. This change
in classification was made in accordance with EITF 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products), because the estimated fair
value of the identifiable benefit was no longer obtained beginning in 2007.

Cotton prices, which were approximately 50 cents per pound in 2006, returned to the
ten year historical average of approximately 56 cents per pound in 2007. The higher excess and
obsolete inventory costs in 2007 compared to 2006 are primarily attributable to $9 million of costs
associated with the rationalization of our socks product category offerings and $5 million related
to exiting a licensing arrangement for a kids’ underwear program. The



remaining $7 million of higher excess and obsolete costs aggregates all other product categories as
part of our continuous evaluation of both inventory levels and simplification of our product
category offerings. The higher accelerated depreciation in 2007 was a result of facilities closed
or to be closed in connection with our consolidation and globalization strategy.

These higher costs were offset primarily by savings from our cost reduction initiatives and
prior restructuring actions of $30 million, lower allocations of overhead costs of $24 million, $19
million of improved plant performance, $13 million of higher sales volume, lower duty costs of $9
million, primarily due to the receipt of $8 million in duty refunds relating to duties paid several
years ago, and $4 million of lower spending in numerous other areas.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $53 million lower in 2007 compared
to 2006. Our expenses were lower primarily due to lower spin off and related charges of $45
million, $12 million of savings from prior restructuring actions, $10 million of lower distribution
expenses and $7 million in amortization of gain on curtailment of postretirement benefits. Our MAP
expenses were lower by $41 million, primarily with respect to non-media related MAP expenses. The
lower non-media related MAP expenses are primarily attributable to $25 million of cost reduction
initiatives and better deployment of these resources and $16 million due to a change in the
classification of certain sales incentives in 2007 which were classified as MAP expenses in 2006.
MAP expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our
advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions. In addition, pension
expense was reduced by $3 million in 2007 as a result of the final separation of our pension assets
and liabilities from those of Sara Lee.

Our
cost reduction efforts during 2007 allowed us to offset
$7 million of higher stand alone
expenses associated with being an independent company and make investments in our strategic
initiatives resulting in $16 million of higher media related MAP expenses and $13 million in higher
technology consulting expenses in 2007. In addition, our allocations of overhead costs were $24
million lower during 2007 compared to 2006. Accelerated depreciation was $3 million higher in 2007
as a result of facilities closed or to be closed in connection with our consolidation and
globalization strategy.

In December 2006, we notified retirees and employees of the phase out of premium subsidies for
early retiree medical coverage and move to an access-only plan for early retirees by the end of
2007. We also eliminated the medical plan for retirees ages 65 and older as a result of coverage
available under the expansion of Medicare with Part D drug coverage and eliminated future
postretirement life benefits. The gain on curtailment in 2006 represented the unrecognized amounts
associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining
service period of the participants prior to the December 2006 amendments. In 2007, we recognized $7
million in postretirement benefit income which was recorded in “Selling, general and administrative
expenses,” primarily representing the amortization of negative prior service costs, which was
partially offset by service costs,
interest costs on the accumulated benefit obligation and actuarial gains and losses
accumulated in the plan. In December 2007, we terminated the existing plan and recognized a final
gain on curtailment of plan benefits of $32 million. Concurrently with the termination of the
existing plan, we established a new access only plan that is fully paid by the participants.

During 2007, we approved actions to close 16 manufacturing facilities and three
distribution centers affecting 6,213 employees in the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the United
States, Brazil and Canada, while moving production to lower-cost
operations in Asia, Central
America and the Caribbean Basin. In addition, 428 management and administrative positions were eliminated, with the
majority of these positions based in the United States. These actions resulted in a charge of $32
million, representing costs associated with the planned termination of 6,641 employees, primarily
attributable to employee and other termination benefits recognized in accordance with benefit plans
previously communicated to the affected employee group. In addition, we recognized a charge of $10
million for estimated lease termination costs and $2 million primarily related to impairment
charges associated with facility closures approved in prior periods, for facilities that were
exited during 2007.

Of the seven manufacturing facilities and distribution centers that were approved for
closure in 2006, two were closed in 2006 and five were closed in 2007. Of the 19 manufacturing
facilities and distribution centers that were approved for closure in 2007, 10 were closed in 2007
and nine were expected to close in 2008.

In connection with our consolidation and globalization strategy, non-cash charges of
$37 million and $3 million, respectively, of accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment
for facilities closed or to be closed is reflected in “Cost of sales” and “Selling, general and
administrative expenses.”

These actions, which are a continuation of our consolidation and globalization strategy, are
expected to result in benefits of moving production to lower-cost manufacturing facilities,
leveraging our large scale in high-volume products and consolidating production capacity.

Interest expense, net was higher in 2007 by $120 million compared to 2006 primarily as
a result of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5,
2006, consisting of $2.6 billion pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Second Lien
Credit Facility and the Bridge Loan Facility. In December 2006, we issued $500 million of Floating
Fate Senior Notes and the net proceeds were used to repay the Bridge Loan Facility.

In February 2007, we entered into a first amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility with
our lenders, which primarily lowered the applicable borrowing margin with respect to the Term B
loan facility from 2.25% to 1.75% on LIBOR based loans and from 1.25% to 0.75% on Base Rate loans.
In November 2007, we entered into the Receivables Facility with conduits that issue commercial
paper in the short-term market and are not affiliated with us, which provides for up to $250
million in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing and is secured by certain domestic trade
receivables. The borrowing rate is generally the conduits’ cost to issue commercial paper, plus
certain dealer fees, which equated to 5.93% from November 27, 2007 through December 29, 2007. Our
weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt in 2007 was 7.74%.

Our effective income tax rate was 31.5% in 2007 compared to 25.5% in 2006. The higher
effective tax rate is attributable primarily to our new independent structure and higher remitted
earnings from foreign subsidiaries in 2007.

Our effective tax rate is heavily influenced by the amount of permanent capital
investment we make outside the United States to fund our supply chain consolidation and
globalization strategy rather than remitting those earnings back to the United States.

As we continue to fund our supply chain consolidation and globalization strategy in future
years, we may elect to permanently invest earnings from foreign subsidiaries which would result in
a lower overall effective tax rate.

Overall net sales in the Innerwear segment were slightly lower by $18 million or 1% in 2007
compared to 2006. We experienced lower sales volume of

Playtex

brand intimate apparel sales of $23
million, lower

Hanes

brand kids’ underwear sales of $21 million, lower licensed men’s underwear
sales in the department store channel of $10 million and $3 million lower

Just My Size

brand sales.
The lower net sales were partially offset by higher

Hanes

brand socks, sleepwear, intimate
apparel sales and men’s underwear of $11 million, $8 million, $5 million and $4 million,
respectively, and higher

Bali

brand sales of $12 million.

Net sales for the

Hanes

brand were higher in most key categories, except for kid’s underwear.

Hanes

men’s underwear benefited from an increased focus on core products and better overall
performance at retail during the year-end holiday season. Total socks sales, which exceeded $340
million in 2007, were higher by 4%, primarily due to new programs at our top two customers. Our

Bali

brand sales were higher primarily as a result of our

Passion for Comfort

media campaign
launched in 2007.

Playtex

brand sales were lower in 2007 due to soft department store retail sales
and a reduction in retail inventory primarily in the first three quarters of 2007.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage in the Innerwear segment was 36.8%
in 2007 compared to 37.4% in 2006. The gross profit percentage was lower due to unfavorable product
sales mix of $19 million, higher excess and obsolete inventory costs of $13 million, unfavorable
product sales pricing of $12 million, $9 million in higher cotton costs and unfavorable plant
performance of $4 million. The higher excess and obsolete inventory costs in 2007 compared to 2006
are primarily attributable to $9 million of costs associated with the rationalization of our socks
product category offerings and $5 million related to exiting a licensing arrangement for a kids’
underwear program. In addition, gross profit was negatively impacted by higher incentives of $15
million primarily due to a change in the classification of certain sales incentives in 2007 which
were classified as media, advertising and promotion expenses in 2006. These higher expenses were
partially offset by lower allocations of overhead costs of $15 million, lower duty costs of $14
million primarily due to the receipt of $7 million in duty refunds relating to duties paid several
years ago, $10 million of higher sales volume and $10 million in savings from our cost reduction
initiatives and prior restructuring actions.

The lower Innerwear segment operating profit in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily
attributable to lower gross profit and a higher allocation of selling, general and administrative
expenses of $22 million. These higher expenses were partially offset by lower MAP expenses of $11
million, primarily due to a change in the classification of certain sales incentives in 2007 which
were classified as MAP expenses in 2006. Our consolidated selling, general and administrative
expenses before segment allocations were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to lower spin
off and related charges, savings from prior restructuring actions, lower distribution expenses,
amortization of gain on curtailment of postretirement benefits, lower MAP expenses and lower
pension expense offset by higher stand alone expenses, lower allocations of overhead costs, higher
accelerated depreciation and higher technology consulting expenses.

Net sales in the Outerwear segment were higher by $68 million in 2007 compared to 2006
primarily as a result of higher

Champion

brand activewear and

Hanes

brand retail casualwear net
sales. Overall activewear and retail casualwear net sales were higher by $60 million and $50
million, respectively, in 2007 compared to 2006. The higher net sales were partially offset by
lower net sales in our casualwear business as a result of lower sales of promotional t-shirts sold
primarily through our embellishment channel of $42 million, most of which occurred in the



first half of 2007.

Champion,

our second largest brand, benefited from higher penetration in
the sporting goods channel, and, together with

C9 by Champion,

in the mid-tier department store
channel. In 2007, we expanded the depth and breadth of distribution in sporting goods with our

Champion Double Dry

performance products.

Champion

sales have increased by double-digits in each
of the three years ended December 2007.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage in the Outerwear segment was 21.6%
in 2007 compared to 19.4% in 2006. The improvement in gross profit is primarily attributable to
improved plant performance of $18 million, savings from our cost reduction initiatives and prior
restructuring actions of $16 million, higher sales volume of $13 million, lower allocations of
overhead costs of $9 million and favorable product sales pricing of $8 million offset primarily by
higher cotton costs of $11 million, higher excess and obsolete inventory costs of $8 million,
higher duty costs of $4 million and higher sales incentives of $4 million.

The higher Outerwear segment operating profit in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily
attributable to a higher gross profit and lower MAP expenses of $3 million which was offset by a
higher allocation of selling, general and administrative expenses of $28 million. Our consolidated
selling, general and administrative expenses before segment allocations were lower in 2007 compared
to 2006 primarily due to lower spin off and related charges, savings from prior restructuring
actions, lower distribution expenses, amortization of gain on curtailment of postretirement
benefits, lower MAP expenses and lower pension expense offset by higher stand alone expenses, lower
allocations of overhead costs, higher accelerated depreciation and higher technology consulting
expenses.

Overall net sales in the International segment were higher by $22 million in 2007 compared to
2006. During 2007 we experienced higher net sales, in each case including the impact of foreign
currency, in Europe of $17 million, higher net sales of $6 million in our emerging markets in Asia
and $3 million of higher sales in Latin America, which were partially offset by lower sales in
Canada of $5 million. The growth in our European casualwear business was primarily driven by the
strength of the

Stedman

and

Hanes

brands that are sold in the embellishment channel. The higher
sales in Asia were the result of significant retail distribution gains in China and India. Changes
in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of $15 million in 2007
compared to 2006 primarily due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and the
Euro.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage was 41.3% in 2007 compared to 40.7%
in 2006 primarily due to $4 million of lower sales incentives, $2 million of favorable product
sales mix and $2 million of favorable product sales pricing.

The higher International segment operating profit in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily
attributable to the higher gross profit from higher sales volume, $3 million in lower MAP expenses
and $1 million in lower distribution expenses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a
favorable impact on segment operating profit of $3 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due
to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and the Euro.

Net sales in the Hosiery segment were lower by $12 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily
due to lower sales of the

L’eggs

brand to mass retailers and food and drug stores. We expect the
trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry
and with shifts in consumer preferences.



As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage was 47.2% in 2007 compared to 41.3%
in 2006 primarily due to improved plant performance of $10 million, lower sales incentives of $3
million and $5 million in savings from our cost reduction initiatives and prior restructuring
actions which was partially offset by $10 million of lower sales volume.

Hosiery segment operating profit was higher in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to a higher
gross profit, $6 million in lower MAP expenses and $12 million in lower allocated selling, general
and administrative expenses.

Our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses before segment allocations were
lower in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to lower spin off and related charges, savings from
prior restructuring actions, lower distribution expenses, amortization of gain on curtailment of
postretirement benefits, lower MAP expenses and lower pension expense offset by higher stand alone
expenses, lower allocations of overhead costs, higher accelerated depreciation and higher

The higher net sales from our Other segment primarily resulted from an immaterial change in
the way we recognized sales to third party suppliers in 2006. The full year change was reflected in
2006 with a $5 million impact on net sales and minimal impact on segment operating profit. Net
sales in this segment are generated for the purpose of maintaining asset utilization at certain
manufacturing facilities.

General Corporate Expenses

General corporate expenses were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to lower spin off
and related charges of $45 million, amortization of gain on postretirement benefits of $7 million
and a $3 million reduction in pension expense related to the final separation of our pension plan
assets and liabilities from those of Sara Lee. These lower expenses were partially offset by higher
stand alone expenses associated with being an independent company of $7 million and $4 million of
higher expenses in numerous other areas.

Net sales decreased $52 million, $12 million and $17 million in our Innerwear, Hosiery and
Other segments, respectively. These declines were offset by increases in net sales of $13 million
and $2 million in our Outerwear and International segments, respectively. Overall net sales
decreased due to a $28 million impact from our intentional discontinuation of low-margin product
lines in the Outerwear segment and a $12 million decrease in sheer hosiery sales. Additionally, the
acquisition of National Textiles, L.L.C. in September 2005 caused a $16 million decrease in our
Other segment as sales to this business were included in net sales in periods prior to the
acquisition. Finally, we experienced slower sell-through of innerwear products in the mass
merchandise and department store retail channels during the latter half of the six months ended
December 30, 2006.

Cost of sales were lower year over year as a result of a decrease in net sales, favorable
spending from the benefits of manufacturing cost savings initiatives and a favorable impact from

cotton costs, unusual charges primarily to exit certain contracts and low margin product lines, and

ownership in the prior year of $21 million. Media, advertising and promotion costs increased $12
million primarily due to unusual charges to exit certain license agreements and additional
investments in our brands. Other unusual charges increasing selling, general and administrative
expenses by $12 million primarily included certain freight revenue being moved to net sales during
the six months ended December 30, 2006 and a reduction of estimated allocations to inventory costs.
In addition, we experienced slightly higher spending of approximately $10 million in numerous areas
such as technology consulting, distribution, severance and market research, which were partially
offset by headcount savings from prior year restructuring actions and a reduction in pension and
postretirement expenses.

In December 2006, we notified retirees and employees that we would phase out premium subsidies
for early retiree medical coverage and move to an access-only plan for early retirees by the end of
2007. We also decided to eliminate the medical plan for retirees ages 65 and older as a result of
coverage available under the expansion of Medicare with Part D drug coverage and eliminate future
postretirement life benefits. The gain on curtailment represents the unrecognized amounts
associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining
service period of the participants prior to the December 2006 amendments. We recorded
postretirement benefit income related to this plan in 2007, primarily representing the amortization
of negative prior service costs, which was partially offset by service costs, interest costs on the
accumulated benefit obligation and actuarial gains and losses accumulated in the plan. We recorded
a final gain on curtailment of plan benefits in December 2007.

During the six months ended December 30, 2006, we approved actions to close four textile and
sewing plants in the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico and consolidate three distribution
centers in the United States. These actions resulted in a charge of $11 million, representing costs
associated with the planned termination of 2,989 employees for employee termination and other
benefits in accordance with benefit plans previously communicated to the affected employee group.
In connection with these restructuring actions, a charge of $21 million for accelerated
depreciation of buildings and equipment is reflected in the “Cost of sales” line of the
Consolidated Statement of Income. These actions were expected to be completed in early 2007. These
actions, which are a continuation of our long-term global supply chain globalization strategy, are
expected to result in benefits of moving production to lower-cost manufacturing facilities,
improved alignment of sewing operations with the flow of textiles, leveraging our large scale in
high-volume products and consolidating production capacity.

Operating profit for the six months ended December 30, 2006 decreased as compared to the six
months ended December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of facility closures announced in the six
months ended December 30, 2006 and restructuring related costs of $32 million, higher non-recurring
spin off and related charges of $17 million, higher costs associated with being an independent
company of $10 million, unusual charges of $35 million primarily to exit certain contracts and low
margin product lines, charges to exit certain license agreements and additional investments in our
brands. In addition, we experienced higher cotton and production related costs of $29 million,
lower gross margin from lower net sales of $16 million and slightly higher selling, general and
administrative spending of approximately $10 million in numerous areas such as technology
consulting, distribution, severance and market research. These higher costs were offset partially
by favorable spending from our prior year restructuring actions, manufacturing cost savings
initiatives, a favorable impact of shifting certain production to lower cost locations and lower
corporate allocations from Sara Lee totaling $59 million and the gain on curtailment of
postretirement benefits of $28 million.

In connection with the spin off, we incurred $2.6 billion of debt pursuant to the Senior
Secured Credit Facility, the Second Lien Credit Facility and the Bridge Loan Facility, $2.4 billion
of the proceeds of which was paid to Sara Lee. As a result, our net interest expense in the six
months ended December 30, 2006 was substantially higher than in the comparable period.

Under the Credit Facilities, we are required to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to
reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate debt issuance. During the six months ended
December 30, 2006, we entered into various hedging arrangements whereby we capped the interest rate
on $1 billion of our floating rate debt at 5.75%. We also entered into interest rate swaps tied to
the 3-month LIBOR whereby we fixed the interest rate on an aggregate of $500 million of our
floating rate debt at a blended rate of approximately 5.16%. Approximately 60% of our total debt
outstanding at December 30, 2006 was at a fixed or capped rate. There was no hedge ineffectiveness
during the six months ended December 30, 2006 period related to these instruments.

In December 2006, we completed the offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of the
Floating Rate Senior Notes. The Floating Rate Senior Notes bear interest at a per annum rate, reset
semiannually, equal to the six month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.375%. The proceeds from the offering
were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Loan Facility.

Our effective income tax rate increased from 24.3% for the six months ended December 31, 2005
to 33.8% for the six months ended December 30, 2006. The increase in our effective tax rate as an
independent company is attributable primarily to the expiration of tax incentives for manufacturing
in Puerto Rico of $9 million, which were repealed effective for the periods after July 1, 2006,
higher taxes on remittances of foreign earnings for the period of $9 million and $5 million tax
effect of lower unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries in the six months ended December 30,
2006 taxed at rates less than the U.S. statutory rate. The tax expense for both periods was
impacted by a number of significant items that are set out in the reconciliation of our effective
tax rate to the U.S. statutory rate in Note 18 titled “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Net sales in our Innerwear segment decreased primarily due to lower men’s underwear
and kids’ underwear sales of $36 million and lower thermal sales of $14 million, as well as
additional investments in our brands as compared to the six months ended December 31, 2005. We
experienced lower sell-through of products in the mass merchandise and department store retail
channels primarily in the latter half of the six months ended December 30, 2006.



As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage in the Innerwear segment
increased from 36.5% for the six months ended December 31, 2005 to 37.0% for the six months ended
December 30, 2006, reflecting a positive impact of favorable spending of $21 million from our prior
year restructuring actions, cost savings initiatives and savings associated with moving to lower
cost locations. These changes were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of lower volumes of
$18 million, higher cotton costs of $7 million and unusual costs of $8 million primarily associated
with exiting certain low margin product lines.

The decrease in segment operating profit is primarily attributable to the gross profit impact
of the items noted above and higher allocated selling, general and administrative expenses of $8
million. Media, advertising and promotion costs were slightly higher due to changes in license
agreements, net of lower media spend on innerwear categories. Our total selling, general and
administrative expenses before segment allocations increased as a result of unusual charges, higher
stand alone costs as an independent company and higher spending in numerous areas such as
technology consulting, distribution, severance and market research, which were partially offset by
headcount savings from prior year restructuring actions and a reduction in pension and
postretirement expenses.

Net sales in our Outerwear segment increased primarily due to $33 million of increased
sales of activewear and $33 million of increased sales of boys’ fleece as compared to the six
months ended December 31, 2005. These changes were partially offset by the $28 million impact of
our intentional exit of certain lower margin fleece product lines, lower women’s and girls’ fleece
sales of $16 million and $9 million of lower sportshirt, jersey and other fleece sales.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage declined from 20.7% for the
six months ended December 31, 2005 to 19.8% for the six months ended December 30, 2006 primarily as
a result of higher cotton costs of $11 million, $5 million associated with exiting certain low
margin product lines and higher duty, freight and contractor costs of $6 million, partially offset
by $19 million in cost savings initiatives and a favorable impact with shifting production to lower
cost locations.

The decrease in segment operating profit is primarily attributable to the gross profit impact
of the items noted above, higher media advertising and promotion expenses directly attributable to
our casualwear products of $15 million and higher allocated selling, general and administrative
expenses of $10 million. Our total selling, general and administrative expenses before segment
allocations increased as a result of unusual charges, higher stand alone costs as an independent

severance and market research, which were partially offset by headcount savings from prior year
restructuring actions and a reduction in pension and postretirement expenses.

Net sales in our International segment increased slightly due to higher sales of
t-shirts in Europe and higher sales in our emerging markets in China, India and Brazil, partially
offset by softer sales in Mexico and lower sales in Japan due to a shift in the launch of fall
seasonal products. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by $3 million.



As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage increased from 39.7% to
40.2% for the six months ended December 30, 2006. The increase resulted primarily from a $3 million
decrease in overall spending and $1 million from positive changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. These changes were offset by a $4 million impact from unfavorable manufacturing efficiencies
compared to the prior period.

The decrease in segment operating profit is attributable to the gross profit impact of the
items noted above offset by higher allocated selling, general and administrative expenses of $3
million.

Net sales in our Hosiery segment decreased primarily due to the continued decline in
U.S. sheer hosiery consumption. As compared to the six months ended December 31, 2005, overall
sales for the Hosiery segment declined 8% due to a continued reduction in sales of

L’eggs

to mass
retailers and food and drug stores and declining sales of

Hanes

to department stores. Overall,
the hosiery market declined 4.5% for the six months ended December 30, 2006.

Gross profit declined slightly primarily due to the decline in net sales offset by
favorable spending of $3 million from cost savings initiatives and a reduction in pension and
postretirement expenses.

Segment operating profit increased due primarily to $10 million of lower allocated selling,
general and administrative expenses.

Net sales in the Other segment decreased primarily due to the acquisition of National
Textiles, L.L.C. in September 2005 which caused a $16 million decline as sales to this business
were previously included in net sales prior to the acquisition.

As a percent of segment net sales, gross profit percentage increased from 4.8% for the
six months ended December 31, 2005 to 9.9% for the six months ended December 30, 2006 primarily as
a result of favorable manufacturing variances.

The decrease in segment operating profit is primarily attributable to higher allocated
selling, general and administrative expenses in the current period of $2 million offset by the
favorable manufacturing variances noted above. As sales of this segment are generated for the
purpose of maintaining asset utilization at certain manufacturing facilities, gross profit and
operating profit are lower than those of our other segments.

General Corporate Expenses

General corporate expenses increased primarily due to higher nonrecurring spin off and related
costs of $17 million and higher stand alone costs of $10 million of operating as an independent
company.

gross margin percentage was primarily due to a $140 million impact from lower cotton costs, and
lower charges for slow moving and obsolete inventories and a $13 million impact from the benefits
of prior year restructuring actions partially offset by an $84 million impact of lower selling
prices and changes in product sales mix. Although our 2006 results benefited from lower cotton
prices, our costs vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton.

Our effective income tax rate decreased from 36.8% in 2005 to 22.5% in 2006. The decrease in
our effective tax rate is attributable primarily to an $81.6 million charge in 2005 related to the
repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the United States. Of this total, $50.0
million was recognized in connection with the remittance of current year earnings to the United
States, and $31.6 million related to earnings repatriated under the provisions of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004. The tax expense for both periods was impacted by a number of significant
items which are set out in the reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. statutory rate
in Note 18 titled “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net sales in the Innerwear segment decreased primarily due to a $65 million impact of
our discontinuation of certain sleepwear, thermal and private label product lines and the closure
of certain retail stores. Net sales were also negatively impacted by $15 million of lower sock
sales due to both lower shipment volumes and lower pricing.

Gross profit percentage in the Innerwear segment increased from 35.1% in 2005 to 37.2%
in 2006, reflecting a $78 million impact of lower charges for slow moving and obsolete inventories,
lower cotton costs and benefits from prior restructuring actions, partially offset by lower gross
margins for socks due to pricing pressure and mix.

The increase in Innerwear segment operating profit is primarily attributable to the increase
in gross margin and a $37 million impact of lower allocated selling expenses and other selling,
general and administrative expenses due to headcount reductions. This is partially offset by $21 million related to higher allocated
media advertising and promotion costs.

of certain low-margin product lines. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales
by $10 million.

Gross profit percentage increased from 39.1% in 2005 to 40.6% in 2006. The increase is
due to lower allocated selling, general and administrative expenses and margin improvements in
sales in Canada resulting from greater purchasing power for contracted goods.

The increase in International segment operating profit is primarily attributable to a $7

Net sales decreased primarily due to the acquisition of National Textiles, L.L.C. in September
2005 which caused a $72 million decline as sales to this business were previously included in net
sales prior to the acquisition. Sales to National Textiles, L.L.C. subsequent to the acquisition of
this business are eliminated for purposes of segment reporting. This decrease was partially offset
by $40 million in fabric sales to third parties by National Textiles, L.L.C. subsequent to the
acquisition. An additional offset was related to increased sales of $7 million due to the
acquisition of a Hong Kong based sourcing business at the end of 2005.

Gross profit and segment operating profit remained flat as compared to 2005. As sales in this
segment are generated for the purpose of maintaining asset utilization at certain manufacturing
facilities, gross profit and operating profit are lower than those of our other segments.

General Corporate Expenses

General corporate expenses not allocated to the segments increased in 2006 from 2005 as a
result of higher incurred costs related to the spin off.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash generated by operations and availability under
our Revolving Loan Facility and our international loan facilities. At January 3, 2009 we had $463
million of borrowing availability under our $500 million Revolving Loan Facility (after taking into
account outstanding letters of credit), $67 million in cash and cash equivalents and $67 million of
borrowing availability under our international loan facilities. We currently believe that our
existing cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with our available credit
capacity, will enable us to comply with the terms of our indebtedness and meet foreseeable
liquidity requirements.

The following has or is expected to impact liquidity:

We are operating in an uncertain and volatile economic environment, which could have
unanticipated adverse effects on our business. The current retail environment has been impacted by
recent volatility in the financial markets, including declines in stock prices, and by uncertain
economic conditions. Increases in food and fuel prices, changes in the credit and housing markets
leading to the current financial and credit
crisis, actual and potential job losses among many sectors of the economy, significant
declines in the stock market resulting in large losses to consumer retirement and investment
accounts, and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and economic policies have all added to
declines in consumer confidence and curtailed retail spending.



We expect the weak retail environment to continue and do not expect macroeconomic conditions
to be conducive to growth in 2009. Achieving financial results that compare favorably with
year-ago results will be challenging in the first half of 2009. In the first quarter of 2009, we
expect a sales decline that is more or less consistent with the fourth quarter 2008 trend and
reflects expected lower casualwear sales in the Outerwear segment primarily in the first half of
2009. We also expect substantial pressure on profitability due to the economic climate,
significantly higher commodity costs, increased pension costs and increased costs associated with
implementing our price increase that is not effective for the entire first quarter of 2009,
including repackaging costs.

We expect to be able to manage our working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts to
maintain sufficient levels of liquidity. Factors that could help us in these efforts include the
domestic gross price increase of 4% commencing during the first quarter of 2009, lower commodity
costs in the second half of the year, the ability to execute previously discussed discretionary
spending cuts and additional cost benefits from previous restructuring and related actions.
Depending on conditions in the capital markets and other factors, we will from time to time
consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current
indebtedness or for other purposes. We continue to monitor the impact, if any, of the current
conditions in the credit markets on our operations. Our access to financing at reasonable interest
rates could become influenced by the economic and credit market environment.

As of January 3, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities.
We ended the year with a leverage ratio, as calculated under the Senior Secured Credit Facility,
the Second Lien Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility, of 3.3 to 1. The maximum leverage
ratio permitted under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility, which are
the most restrictive, was 3.75 to 1 for the quarter ended January 3, 2009 and will decline over
time until it reaches 3.00 to 1 for quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of 2009.
Particularly in the current adverse economic climate, we continue to monitor our covenant
compliance carefully. We expect to maintain compliance with our covenants during 2009, however
economic conditions or the occurrence of events discussed above under “Risk Factors” could cause
noncompliance. We have been exploring and will continue to explore the multiple options available,
including amendments to credit facilities, to ensure that we remain in compliance with our
covenants in this uncertain economic environment. Any one of these options could result in
significantly higher interest expense in 2009 and beyond. In addition, these options could require
modification of our interest rate derivative portfolio, which could require us to make a cash
payment in the event of terminating a derivative instrument or impact the effectiveness of our
interest rate hedging instruments and require us to take non-cash charges.

Cash Requirements for Our Business

We rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our
Revolving Loan Facility and international loan facilities to meet the cash requirements of our
business. The primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the normal
course of business, restructuring costs, capital expenditures, maturities of long-term debt and
related interest payments, contributions to our pension plans and repurchases of our stock. We
believe we have sufficient cash and available borrowings for our short-term needs. In light of the
current economic environment and our outlook for 2009, we expect to use excess cash flows to pay
down long-term debt rather than to repurchase our stock or make discretionary contributions to our
pension plans.

The implementation of our consolidation and globalization strategy, which is designed to
improve operating efficiencies and lower costs, has resulted and is likely to continue to result in
significant costs in the short-term and generate savings as well as higher inventory levels for the
next 12 to 15 months. As further plans are developed and approved, we expect to recognize
additional restructuring costs as we eliminate duplicative functions within the organization and
transition a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to lower-cost locations.

While capital spending could vary significantly from year to year, we anticipated early in
2008 that our capital spending over the next three years could be as high as $500 million as we
continue to execute our supply chain consolidation and globalization strategy and complete the
integration and consolidation of our technology systems. In light of the current economic
recession, we have re-evaluated our future spending plans and reduced the expected amounts during
2008 through 2010 to be approximately $400 million. We will place emphasis in the near term on
careful management of our capital expenditures in 2009 and 2010. Capital spending in any given
year over the next three years could be significantly in excess of our annual depreciation and
amortization expense until the completion of actions related to our globalization strategy at which
time we would expect our annual capital spending to be relatively comparable to our annual
depreciation and amortization expense.



Pension Plans

Since the spin off, we have voluntarily contributed $98 million to our pension plans.
Additionally, during 2007 we completed the separation of our pension plan assets and liabilities
from those of Sara Lee in accordance with governmental regulations, which resulted in a higher
total amount of pension plan assets of approximately $74 million being transferred to us than
originally was estimated prior to the spin off. Prior to spin off, the fair value of plan assets
included in the annual valuations represented a best estimate based upon a percentage allocation of
total assets of the Sara Lee trust.

As widely reported, financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have been
experiencing extreme disruption in recent months. As a result of this disruption in the domestic
and international equity and bond markets, our pension plans had a decrease in asset values of
approximately 32% during the year ended January 3, 2009. Our U.S. qualified pension plans are
approximately 75% funded as of January 3, 2009 and we do not expect to be required to make any
mandatory contributions to our plans in 2009. We may elect to make voluntary contributions to
obtain an 80% funded level which will avoid certain benefit payment restrictions under the Pension
Protection Act. The funded status reflects a significant decrease in the fair value of plan assets
due to the stock market’s performance during 2008 which we expect will result in increased pension
expense in 2009 of $33 million to $21 million. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements
for more information on the plan asset components.

Share Repurchase Program

On February 1, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors granted authority for the
repurchase of up to 10 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically
in open-market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other
factors. Additionally, management has been granted authority to establish a trading plan under Rule
10b5-1 of the Exchange Act in connection with share repurchases, which will allow us to repurchase
shares in the open market during periods in which the stock trading window is otherwise closed for
our company and certain of our officers and employees pursuant to our insider trading policy.
During 2008, we purchased 1.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $30 million (average
price of $24.71). Since inception of the program, we have purchased 2.8 million shares of our
common stock at a cost of $75 million (average price of $26.33). The primary objective of our share
repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution caused by the exercise of options and
vesting of stock unit awards. In light of the current economic recession, we may choose not to
repurchase any stock and focus more on the repayment of our debt in the next twelve months.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of
Item 303(a)(4) of SEC Regulation S-K.

(1)

Interest obligations on floating rate debt instruments are calculated for future periods
using interest rates in effect at January 3, 2009.

(2)

“Purchase obligations,” as disclosed in the table, are obligations to purchase goods and
services in the ordinary course of business for production and inventory needs (such as raw
materials, supplies, packaging, and manufacturing arrangements), capital expenditures,
marketing services, royalty-bearing license agreement payments and other professional
services. This table only includes purchase obligations for which we have agreed upon a fixed
or minimum quantity to purchase, a fixed, minimum or variable pricing arrangement, and an
approximate delivery date. Actual cash expenditures relating to these obligations may vary
from the amounts shown in the table above. We enter into purchase obligations when terms or
conditions are favorable or when a long-term commitment is necessary. Many of these
arrangements are cancelable after a notice period without a significant penalty. This table
omits purchase obligations that did not exist as of January 3, 2009, as well as obligations
for accounts payable and accrued liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(3)

Represents the projected payment for long-term liabilities recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet for deferred compensation, severance, certain employee benefit claims, capital
leases and unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FASB Interpretation 48,

Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”).

Due to our current funded status of our pension plans, we do not expect to be required to make
any mandatory contributions to the plans in the next year. The future timing of the pension funding
obligations associated with our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans beyond the next
year is dependent on a number of factors including investment results and other factors that
contribute to future pension expense and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. A discussion
of our pension and postretirement plans is included in Notes 16 and 17 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements. Our obligations for employee health and property and casualty losses are also
excluded from the table.

Sources and Uses of Our Cash

The information presented below regarding the sources and uses of our cash flows for the years

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $177 million in 2008 compared to $359 million in
2007. The net change in cash from operating activities of $182 million for 2008 compared to 2007 is
attributable to the higher uses of our working capital, primarily driven by changes in inventory.
Inventory grew $183
million from December 29, 2007 primarily due to increases in levels needed to service our
business as we continue to execute our consolidation and globalization strategy which had an impact
of approximately $112 million. In addition, cost increases for inputs such as cotton, oil and
freight were approximately $53 million and other factors such as reserves had an impact of
approximately $18 million. We continually monitor our inventory levels to best balance current
supply and demand with potential future demand that typically surges when consumers no longer
postpone purchases in our product categories. Accounts receivable was lower in 2008 compared to
2007 primarily as a result of lower sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2008.



Over the next twelve to fifteen months, we expect to decrease our inventory levels to
approximately $1.15 billion as we complete the execution of our supply chain consolidation and
globalization strategy. Due to the normal pattern of building inventories for back to school
selling seasons, first quarter 2009 inventories could temporarily increase from this year end
level.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $177 million in 2008 compared to $101 million in
2007. The higher net cash used in investing activities of $76 million for 2008 compared to 2007 was
primarily the result of higher capital expenditures. During 2008 gross capital expenditures were
$187 million as we continued to build out our textile and sewing network in Asia, Central America
and the Caribbean Basin and invest in our technology strategic initiatives which were offset by
cash proceeds from sales of assets of $25 million, primarily from dispositions of plant and
equipment associated with our restructuring initiatives. In addition, we acquired a sewing
operation in Thailand and an embroidery operation in Honduras for an aggregate cost of $15 million
during 2008.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $105 million in 2008 compared to $243 million in
2007. The lower net cash used in financing activities of $138 million for 2008 compared to 2007 was
primarily the result of lower repayments of $303 million under the Senior Secured Credit Facility,
higher net borrowings on notes payable of $65 million, the receipt from Sara Lee of $18 million in
cash in 2008 and lower stock repurchases of $14 million, partially offset by borrowings of $250
million of principal under the Receivables Facility in 2007, repayments of $7 million under the
Receivables Facility in 2008 and cash paid to repurchase $4 million of Floating Rate Senior Notes
in 2008.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

As of January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, cash and cash equivalents were $67 million and
$174 million, respectively. The lower cash and cash equivalents as of January 3, 2009 was primarily
the result of net capital expenditures of $162 million, net principal payments on debt of $139
million, $30 million of stock repurchases, the acquisitions of a sewing operation in Thailand and
an embroidery operation in Honduras for an aggregate cost of $15 million partially offset by $178
million related to other uses of working capital, $43 million of net borrowings on notes payable
and the receipt from Sara Lee of $18 million in cash.

Financing Arrangements

We believe our financing structure provides a secure base to support our ongoing operations
and key business strategies. Depending on conditions in the capital markets and other factors, we
will from time to time consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used
to refinance current indebtedness or for other purposes. We continue to monitor the impact, if any,
of the current conditions in the credit markets on our operations. Our access to financing at
reasonable interest rates could become influenced by the economic and credit market environment.
Deterioration in the capital markets, which has caused many financial institutions to seek
additional capital, merge with larger and stronger financial institutions and, in some cases, fail,
has led to concerns about the stability of financial institutions. We currently hold interest rate
cap and swap derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk
and hold foreign exchange rate derivative instruments to mitigate the potential impact of
currency fluctuations. Credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to these
arrangements. We mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties. We believe
that our exposures are appropriately diversified across counterparties and that these
counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions.

Moody’s Investors Service’s (“Moody’s”) corporate credit rating for us is Ba3 and Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services’ (“Standard & Poor’s”) corporate credit rating for us is BB-. In May 2008,
Standard & Poor’s raised our corporate credit rating from B+, and also raised our bank loan and
unsecured debt ratings. Standard & Poor’s stated that the rating upgrade reflects our positive
operating momentum as a stand-alone entity since our spin off from Sara Lee in September 2006, and
also stated that our credit protection measures and operating results have improved and are in line
with Standard & Poor’s expectations. Standard & Poor’s also noted that management is on track in



executing our strategies. The current outlook of both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s for us is
“stable.” Moody’s did not change our corporate credit rating or its ratings for our bank loans or
unsecured debt during 2008.

In connection with the spin off, on September 5, 2006, we entered into the $2.15 billion
Senior Secured Credit Facility which includes the $500 million Revolving Loan Facility that was
undrawn at the time of the spin off, the $450 million Second Lien Credit Facility and the $500
million Bridge Loan Facility. We paid $2.4 billion of the proceeds of these borrowings to Sara Lee
in connection with the consummation of the spin off. As of January 3, 2009, we had $463 million of
borrowing availability under the Revolving Loan Facility after taking into account outstanding
letters of credit. The Bridge Loan Facility was paid off in full through the issuance of the $500
million of Floating Rate Senior Notes issued in December 2006. On November 27, 2007, we entered
into the Receivables Facility which provides for up to $250 million in funding accounted for as a
secured borrowing, limited to the availability of eligible receivables, and is secured by certain
domestic trade receivables. The proceeds from the Receivables Facility were used to pay off a
portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

Senior Secured Credit Facility

The Senior Secured Credit Facility initially provided for aggregate borrowings of $2.15
billion, consisting of: (i) a $250.0 million Term A loan facility (the “Term A Loan Facility”);
(ii) a $1.4 billion Term B loan facility (the “Term B Loan Facility”); and (iii) the $500 million
Revolving Loan Facility that was undrawn as of January 3, 2009. Issuances of letters of credit
reduce the amount available under the Revolving Loan Facility. As of January 3, 2009, $37 million
of standby and trade letters of credit were issued under this facility and $463 million was
available for borrowing. As of January 3, 2009, $139 million and $851 million in principal was
outstanding under the Term A Loan Facility and Term B Loan Facility, respectively.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and
future direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon exceptions for
certain subsidiaries. We and each of the guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facility have
granted the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility a valid and perfected first priority
(subject to certain customary exceptions) lien and security interest in the following:

•

the equity interests of substantially all of our direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries
and 65% of the voting securities of certain foreign subsidiaries; and

•

substantially all present and future property and assets, real and personal, tangible
and intangible, of Hanesbrands and each guarantor, except for certain enumerated
interests, and all proceeds and products of such property and assets.

The Term A Loan Facility matures on September 5, 2012. The Term A Loan Facility will amortize
in an amount per annum equal to the following: year 1 — 5.00%; year 2 — 10.00%; year 3 — 15.00%;
year 4 — 20.00%; year 5 — 25.00%; year 6 — 25.00%. The Term B Loan Facility matures on September
5, 2013. The Term B Loan Facility will be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal
to 1% per annum, with the balance due on the maturity date. The Revolving Loan Facility matures on
September 5, 2011. All borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility must be repaid in full upon maturity.
Outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are prepayable without penalty. As
a result of the prepayments of principal we have made, we do not have any mandatory payments of
principal in 2009.

At our option, borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility may be maintained from time
to time as (a) Base Rate loans, which shall bear interest at the higher of (i) 1/2 of 1% in excess
of the federal funds rate and (ii) the rate published in the Wall Street Journal as the “prime
rate” (or equivalent), in each case in effect from time to time, plus the applicable margin in
effect from time to time (which is currently 0.50% for the Term A Loan Facility and the Revolving
Loan Facility and 0.75% for the Term B Loan Facility), or (b) LIBOR-based loans, which shall bear
interest at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and adjusted for
maximum reserves), as determined by the administrative agent for the respective interest period
plus the applicable margin in effect from time to time (which is currently 1.50% for the Term A
Loan Facility and the Revolving Loan Facility and 1.75% for the Term B Loan Facility).

In February 2007, we entered into an amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, pursuant
to which the applicable margin with respect to Term B Loan Facility was reduced from 2.25% to 1.75%
with respect to LIBOR-based loans and from 1.25% to 0.75% with respect to loans maintained as Base
Rate loans.



On August 21, 2008, we entered into a Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Senior
Secured Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the amount of unsecured indebtedness
which we and our subsidiaries that are obligors pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility may
incur under senior notes was increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000. The provisions of the Senior
Secured Credit Facility which require the proceeds of the issuance of any such notes be applied to
repay amounts due with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and specify how any such
proceeds will be applied, remain unchanged.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires us to comply with customary affirmative, negative
and financial covenants. The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires that we maintain a minimum
interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to EBITDA (earnings before income taxes,
depreciation expense and amortization), or leverage ratio. The interest coverage ratio covenant
requires that the ratio of our EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters to our consolidated
total interest expense for such period shall not be less than a specified ratio for each fiscal
quarter ending after December 15, 2006. This ratio was 2.75 to 1 for the quarter ended January 3,
2009 and will increase over time until it reaches 3.25 to 1 for fiscal quarters ending after
October 15, 2009. The leverage ratio covenant requires that the ratio of our total debt to our
EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters will not be more than a specified ratio for each
fiscal quarter ending after December 15, 2006. This ratio was 3.75 to 1 for the quarter ended
January 3, 2009 and will decline over time until it reaches 3 to 1 for fiscal quarters ending after
October 15, 2009. The method of calculating all of the components used in the covenants is included
in the Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of January 3, 2009, we were in compliance with all
covenants.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment
of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts after stated grace period;
inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of covenants; certain bankruptcies and
liquidations; any cross-default of more than $50 million; certain judgments of more than $50
million; certain events related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended,
or “ERISA,” and a change in control (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility).

Second Lien Credit Facility

The Second Lien Credit Facility provides for aggregate borrowings of $450 million by
Hanesbrands’ wholly-owned subsidiary, HBI Branded Apparel Limited, Inc. The Second Lien Credit
Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by Hanesbrands and each entity guaranteeing the Senior
Secured Credit Facility, subject to the same exceptions and exclusions provided in the Senior
Secured Credit Facility. The Second Lien Credit Facility and the guarantees in respect thereof are
secured on a second-priority basis (subordinate only to the Senior Secured Credit Facility and any
permitted additions thereto or refinancings
thereof) by substantially all of the assets that secure the Senior Secured Credit Facility
(subject to the same exceptions).

Loans under the Second Lien Credit Facility will bear interest in the same manner as those
under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to a margin of 2.75% for Base Rate loans and
3.75% for LIBOR based loans.

On August 21, 2008, we entered into an amendment (the “Second Lien Amendment”) to the Second
Lien Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Second Lien Amendment, the amount of unsecured indebtedness
which we and our subsidiaries that are obligors pursuant to the Second Lien Credit Facility may
incur under senior notes was increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000. The provisions of the Second
Lien Credit Facility which require the proceeds of the issuance of any such notes be applied to
repay amounts due with respect to the Second Lien Credit Facility, and specify how any such
proceeds will be applied, remain unchanged.

The Second Lien Credit Facility requires us to comply with customary affirmative, negative and
financial covenants. The Second Lien Credit Facility requires that we maintain a minimum interest
coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. The interest coverage ratio covenant requires that the
ratio of our EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters to our consolidated total interest
expense for such period shall not be less than a specified ratio for each fiscal quarter ending
after December 15, 2006. This ratio was 2.0 to 1 for the quarter ended January 3, 2009 and will
increase over time until it reaches 2.5 to 1 for fiscal quarters ending after April 15, 2009. The
leverage ratio covenant requires that the ratio of our total debt to our EBITDA for the preceding
four fiscal quarters will not be more than a specified ratio for each fiscal quarter ending after
December 15, 2006. This ratio was 4.5 to 1 for the quarter ended
January 3, 2009 and will decline over
time until it reaches 3.75 to 1 for fiscal quarters ending after October 15, 2009. The method of
calculating all of the components used in the covenants is included in the Second Lien Credit
Facility. As of January 3, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants.



The Second Lien Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of
principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts after stated grace period;
inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of covenants; certain bankruptcies and
liquidations; any cross-default of more than $60 million; certain judgments of more than $60
million; certain ERISA-related events; and a change in control (as defined in the Second Lien
Credit Facility).

The Second Lien Credit Facility matures on March 5, 2014, and includes premiums for prepayment
of the loan prior to September 5, 2009 based on the timing of the prepayment. The Second Lien
Credit Facility will not amortize and will be repaid in full on its maturity date.

Floating Rate Senior Notes

On December 14, 2006, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate
Senior Notes. The Floating Rate Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in
right of payment with all of our existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. The Floating Rate
Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate, reset semi-annually, equal to LIBOR plus 3.375%.
Interest is payable on the Floating Rate Senior Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The
Floating Rate Senior Notes will mature on December 15, 2014. The net proceeds from the sale of the
Floating Rate Senior Notes were approximately $492 million. As noted above, these proceeds,
together with our working capital, were used to repay in full the $500 million outstanding under
the Bridge Loan Facility. The Floating Rate Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our
domestic subsidiaries.

We may redeem some or all of the Floating Rate Senior Notes at any time on or after December
15, 2008 at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Floating Rate Senior Notes plus
a premium of 2% if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on December 15, 2008, 1% if
redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on December 15, 2009 and no premium if redeemed
after December 15, 2010, as well as any accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. We
repurchased $6 million of the Floating Rate Senior Notes for $4 million resulting in a gain of $2
million during the year ended January 3, 2009.

Accounts Receivable Securitization

On November 27, 2007, we entered into the Receivables Facility, which provides for up to $250
million in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing, limited to the availability of eligible
receivables, and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables. The Receivables Facility will
terminate on November 27, 2010. Under the terms of the Receivables Facility, the company sells, on
a revolving basis, certain domestic trade receivables to HBI Receivables LLC (“Receivables LLC”), a
wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that in turn uses the trade receivables to secure the
borrowings, which are funded through conduits that issue commercial paper in the short-term market
and are not affiliated with us or through committed bank purchasers if the conduits fail to fund.
The assets and liabilities of Receivables LLC are fully reflected on our Consolidated Balance
Sheet, and the securitization is treated as a secured borrowing for accounting purposes. The
borrowings under the Receivables Facility remain outstanding throughout the term of the agreement
subject to our maintaining sufficient eligible receivables by continuing to sell trade receivables
to Receivables LLC unless an event of default occurs. Availability of funding under the facility
depends primarily upon the eligible outstanding receivables balance. As of January 3, 2009, we had
$243 million outstanding under the Receivables Facility. The outstanding balance under the
Receivables Facility is reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet in long-term debt based on the
three-year term of the agreement and the fact that remittances on the receivables do not
automatically reduce the outstanding borrowings.

We used all $250 million of the proceeds from the Receivables Facility to make a prepayment of
principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Unless the conduits fail to fund, the yield on
the commercial paper is the conduits’ cost to issue the commercial paper plus certain dealer fees,
is considered a financing cost and is included in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of
Income. If the conduits fail to fund, the Receivables Facility would be funded through committed
bank purchasers, and the interest rate payable at our option at the rate announced from time to
time by JPMorgan as its prime rate or at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Receivables Facility)
plus the applicable margin in effect from time to time. The average blended interest rate for the
year ended January 3, 2009 was 3.50%.



The Receivables Facility contains customary events of default and requires us to maintain the
same interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio as required by the Senior Secured Credit Facility.
As of January 3, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants.

Notes Payable

Notes payable were $62 million at January 3, 2009 and $20 million at December 29, 2007.

We have a short-term revolving facility arrangement with a Salvadoran branch of a U.S. bank
amounting to $45 million of which $29 million was outstanding at January 3, 2009 which accrues
interest at 7.38%. We were in compliance with the covenants contained in this facility at January
3, 2009.

We have a short-term revolving facility arrangement with a Thai branch of a U.S. bank
amounting to THB 600 million ($17 million) of which $15 million was outstanding at January 3, 2009
which accrues interest at 4.35%. We were in compliance with the covenants contained in this
facility at January 3, 2009.

We have a short-term revolving facility arrangement with a Chinese branch of a U.S. bank
amounting to RMB 56 million ($8 million) of which $8 million was outstanding at January 3, 2009
which accrues interest at 5.36%. Borrowings under the facility accrue interest at the prevailing
base lending rates published by the People’s Bank of China from time to time less 10%. We were in
compliance with the covenants contained in this facility at January 3, 2009.

We have a short-term revolving facility arrangement with an Indian branch of a U.S. bank
amounting to INR 260 million ($5 million) of which $5 million was outstanding at January 3, 2009
which accrues interest at 16.50%. We were in compliance with the covenants contained in this
facility at January 3, 2009.

We have other short-term obligations amounting to $4,029 which consisted of a short-term
revolving facility arrangement with a Japanese branch of a U.S. bank amounting to JPY 1,100 million
($12 million)
of which $2 million was outstanding at January 3, 2009 which accrues interest at 2.42%, and a
short-term revolving facility arrangement with a Vietnamese branch of a U.S. bank amounting to $14
million of which $2 million was outstanding at January 3, 2009 which accrues interest at 12.14%. We
were in compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities at January 3, 2009.

In addition, we have short-term revolving credit facilities in various other locations that
can be drawn on from time to time amounting to $27 million of which $0 was outstanding at January
3, 2009.

Derivatives

We are required under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Second Lien Credit Facility
to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate
debt issuance. Given the recent turmoil in the financial and credit markets, we have expanded our
interest rate hedging portfolio at what we believe to be advantageous rates that are expected to
minimize our overall interest rate risk. At January 3, 2009, we have outstanding hedging
arrangements whereby we capped the interest rate on $400 million of our floating rate debt at
3.50%. We also entered into interest rate swaps tied to the 3-month and 6-month LIBOR rates whereby
we fixed the interest rate on an aggregate of $1.4 billion of our floating rate debt at a blended
rate of approximately 4.16%. Approximately 82% of our total debt outstanding at January 3, 2009 is
at a fixed or capped LIBOR rate. The table below summarizes our interest rate derivative portfolio
with respect to our long-term debt as of January 3, 2009.

We use forward exchange and option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign
currencies for a portion of our anticipated short-term foreign currency-denominated transactions.

Cotton is the primary raw material we use to manufacture many of our products. We generally
purchase our raw materials at market prices. We use commodity financial instruments, options and
forward contracts to hedge the price of cotton, for which there is a high correlation between the
hedged item and the hedged instrument. We generally do not use commodity financial instruments to
hedge other raw material commodity prices.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly
report our operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, titled “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on
an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation. If actual results
ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in
the period in which the actual amounts become known. The critical accounting policies that involve
the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our Consolidated
Financial Statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are the following:

Sales Recognition and Incentives

We recognize revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii) the sales
price is fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the
customer and (iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, which occurs primarily upon
shipment. We record
provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and
current customer information. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes
adjustments based upon actual experience.

Note 2(d), titled “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Sales Recognition and
Incentives,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements describes a variety of sales incentives that
we offer to resellers and consumers of our products. Measuring the cost of these incentives
requires, in many cases, estimating future customer utilization



and redemption rates. We use
historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs. Our
management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience
and other available information. We classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a
reduction of “Net sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Income in accordance with EITF 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s
Products)

.

Accounts Receivable Valuation

Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers. We carry our accounts
receivable at their net realizable value. We record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based
upon our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio determined
on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other
currently available information. Charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in
the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line and charges to the allowance for customer
chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the “Net sales”
line of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter
and makes adjustments based upon actual experience. Because we cannot predict future changes in
the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may
differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in their inability to make payments, a large reserve might be required. The amount of
actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts.

Catalog Expenses

We incur expenses for printing catalogs for our products to aid in our sales efforts. We
initially record these expenses as a prepaid item and charge it against selling, general and
administrative expenses over time as the catalog is used. Expenses are recognized at a rate that
approximates our historical experience with regard to the timing and amount of sales attributable
to a catalog distribution.

Inventory Valuation

We carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined by the first-in, first-out, or “FIFO,” method for our inventories. We carry obsolete,
damaged, and excess inventory at the net realizable value, which we determine by assessing
historical recovery rates, current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans.
Because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time, there are inherent
uncertainties related to our value determination. Market factors and other conditions underlying
the net realizable value may change, resulting in further reserve requirements. A reduction in the
carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the
item that cannot be reversed at a later period. While we believe that adequate write-downs for
inventory obsolescence have been provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements, consumer tastes
and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write-downs in
the future.

Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory
purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item, and are therefore
reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold.

Income Taxes

Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between
financial and
income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. We have recorded deferred taxes related to operating losses and capital loss
carryforwards. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in
specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, possible changes in tax laws
and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate
sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, we
have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be
ultimately realized. An adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if
we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded
amount. Prior to spin off on September 5, 2006, all income taxes were computed and reported on a
separate return basis as if we were not part of Sara Lee.



Federal income taxes are provided on that portion of our income of foreign subsidiaries that
is expected to be remitted to the United States and be taxable, reflecting the historical decisions
made by Sara Lee with regards to earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. In
periods after the spin off, we may make different decisions as to the amount of earnings
permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions, due to anticipated cash flow or other business
requirements, which may impact our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate.

We periodically estimate the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax
jurisdictions and our informed judgment. There are inherent uncertainties related to the
interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business. The judgments
and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as
changes to, or further interpretations of, regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in the
period in which these events occur, and these adjustments are included in our Consolidated
Statements of Income. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate may
increase or decrease in any period. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued Interpretation 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), which became
effective during the year ended December 29, 2007. FIN 48 addresses the determination of how tax
benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
statements. Under FIN 48, a company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a
greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

In conjunction with the spin off, we and Sara Lee entered into a tax sharing agreement, which
allocates responsibilities between us and Sara Lee for taxes and certain other tax matters. Under
the tax sharing agreement, Sara Lee generally is liable for all U.S. federal, state, local and
foreign income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods ending on or before
September 5, 2006. Sara Lee also is liable for income taxes attributable to us with respect to
taxable periods beginning before September 5, 2006 and ending after September 5, 2006, but only to
the extent those taxes are allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on September 5,
2006. We are generally liable for all other taxes attributable to us. Changes in the amounts
payable or receivable by us under the stipulations of this agreement may impact our tax provision
in any period.

Under the tax sharing agreement, within 180 days after Sara Lee filed its final consolidated
tax return for the period that included September 5, 2006, Sara Lee was required to deliver to us a
computation of the amount of deferred taxes attributable to our United States and Canadian
operations that would be included on our opening balance sheet as of September 6, 2006 (“as finally
determined”) which has been done. We have the right to participate in the computation of the amount
of deferred taxes. Under the tax sharing agreement, if substituting the amount of deferred taxes
as finally determined for the amount of estimated deferred taxes that were included on that balance
sheet at the time of the spin off causes a decrease in the net book value reflected on that balance
sheet, then Sara Lee will be required to pay us the amount of such decrease. If such substitution
causes an increase in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet, then we will be required
to pay Sara Lee the amount of such increase. For purposes of this computation, our deferred taxes
are the amount of deferred tax benefits (including deferred tax consequences attributable to
deductible temporary differences and carryforwards) that would be recognized as assets on the
Company’s
balance sheet computed in accordance with GAAP, but without regard to valuation allowances,
less the amount of deferred tax liabilities (including deferred tax consequences attributable to
taxable temporary differences) that would be recognized as liabilities on our opening balance sheet
computed in accordance with GAAP, but without regard to valuation allowances. Neither we nor Sara
Lee will be required to make any other payments to the other with respect to deferred taxes.

Our computation of the final amount of deferred taxes for our opening balance sheet as of
September 6, 2006 is as follows:

opening balance sheet on September 6, 2006

Stock Compensation

We established the Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2006, the (“Omnibus Incentive
Plan”) to award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
deferred stock units, performance shares and cash to our employees, non-employee directors and
employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and
retention of employees. We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

. Under SFAS 123R,
stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair value and is
recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Estimation of stock-based compensation for
stock options granted, utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, requires various highly
subjective assumptions including volatility and expected option life. We use a combination of the
volatility of our company and the volatility of peer companies for a period of time that is
comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions. We have utilized
the simplified method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 to estimate expected lives
of options granted during the period. SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 110, which was issued
in December 2007, amends SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 and gives a limited extension on
using the simplified method for valuing stock option grants to eligible public companies that do
not have sufficient historical exercise patterns on options granted to employees. Further, as
required under SFAS No. 123R, we estimate forfeitures for stock-based awards granted, which are not
expected to vest. If any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly, our stock-based
compensation expense could be materially different in the future.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

For a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost, plan obligations, plan assets, and how we
measure the amount of these costs, see Note 16 titled “Defined Benefit Pension Plans” to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In conjunction with the spin off from Sara Lee which occurred on September 5, 2006, we
established the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension and Retirement Plan, which assumed the portion of the
underfunded liabilities and the portion of the assets of pension plans sponsored by Sara Lee that
relate to our employees. In addition, we assumed sponsorship of certain other Sara Lee plans and
continued sponsorship of the Playtex Apparel Inc. Pension Plan and the National Textiles, L.L.C.
Pension Plan. As of January 1, 2006, the benefits under these plans were frozen. Since the spin
off, we have voluntarily contributed $98 million to our pension plans. Additionally, during 2007 we
completed the separation of our pension plan assets and liabilities from those of Sara Lee in
accordance with governmental regulations, which resulted in a higher
total amount of pension plan assets of approximately $74 million being transferred to us than
originally was estimated prior to the spin off. As a result, our U.S. qualified pension plans are
approximately 75% funded as of January 3, 2009. We may elect to make voluntary contributions to
obtain an 80% funded level which will avoid certain benefit payment restrictions under the Pension
Protection Act. The funded status as of January 3, 2009 reflects a significant decrease in the fair
value of plan assets due to the stock market’s performance during 2008.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (“SFAS
158”). SFAS 158 requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be
recognized on a company’s balance sheet, and changes in the funded status be reflected in
comprehensive income, effective fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, which we adopted as of
and for the six months ended December 30, 2006. The impact of adopting the funded status provisions
of SFAS 158 was an increase in assets of $1 million, an increase in liabilities of $26 million and
a pretax increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of $32 million. SFAS 158 also
requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of its fiscal year end,
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. We adopted the measurement date
provision during the year ended December 29, 2007, which had an immaterial impact on beginning
retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and pension liabilities.

The net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial
assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long-term rate of asset
return. The net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred. Gains and
losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are amortized over
the average future expected life of participants.



Our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows:

•

In determining the discount rate, we utilized the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve
(rounded to the nearest 10 basis points) in order to determine a unique interest rate for
each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan.

•

Salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future
management actions. The salary increase assumption applies to the Canadian plans and
portions of the Hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans, as benefits under these plans
are not frozen.

•

In determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally
weighted blend between assuming the historical long-term compound growth rate of the plan
portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments, and the utilization of
forward looking assumptions.

•

Retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial
tables were used to estimate mortality.

Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangibles

Trademarks and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets. We amortize
identifiable intangibles with finite lives, and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with
indefinite lives. We base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a
number of factors, including the effects of demand, competition, expected changes in distribution
channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows. As of
January 3, 2009, the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was
$147 million, of which we are amortizing the entire balance. We anticipate that our amortization
expense for 2009 will be $12 million.

We evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a
process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under “— Depreciation
and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment.” We assess identifiable intangible assets not
subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur.
In order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization,
we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. We recognize an
impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds
its fair value.

We measure a trademark’s fair value using the royalty saved method. We determine the royalty
saved method by evaluating various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows, including
operating results, business plans, and present value techniques. The rates we use to discount cash
flows are based on interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Because there are
inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them, the assumptions
underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur
in the future. Such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known.

Goodwill

As of January 3, 2009, we had $322 million of goodwill. We do not amortize goodwill, but we
assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur. The timing of
our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter.

In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we estimate the fair value of our reporting
units. We have determined that our reporting units are at the operating segment level. We rely on a
number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors
to discount anticipated future cash flows, including operating results, business plans, and present
value techniques. As discussed above under “Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangibles,” there
are inherent uncertainties related to these factors, and our judgment in applying them and the
assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value
may occur in the future. Such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes
known.

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step process based on an evaluation of
reporting units. The first step involves a comparison of a reporting unit’s fair value to its
carrying value. In the second step, if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value,
we compare the goodwill’s implied fair value and its carrying



value. If the goodwill’s carrying value exceeds its implied fair value, we recognize an
impairment loss in an amount equal to such excess.

Depreciation and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment

We state property, plant and equipment at its historical cost, and we compute depreciation
using the straight-line method over the asset’s life. We estimate an asset’s life based on
historical experience, manufacturers’ estimates, engineering or appraisal evaluations, our future
business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us, which may be the
same as or shorter than its physical life. Our policies require that we periodically review our
assets’ remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization. A
change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated
depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods. Based upon current levels
of depreciation, the average remaining depreciable life of our net property other than land is five
years.

We test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
its carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in
business climate, several periods of operating or cash flow losses, forecasted continuing losses or
a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful
life. We evaluate an asset’s recoverability by comparing the asset or asset group’s net carrying
amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate.
If we determine that an asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

When we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use, we depreciate the asset’s
adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life. We do not restore previously recognized
impairment losses if circumstances change.

Insurance Reserves

We maintain insurance coverage for property, workers’ compensation and other casualty
programs. We are responsible for losses up to certain limits and are required to estimate a
liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. This
liability is based on management’s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known
claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not
discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends,
actuarial assumptions and economic conditions. If actual trends differ from the estimates, the
financial results could be impacted. Actual trends have not differed materially from the
estimates.

Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions using the purchase method, which requires us to allocate
the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated
fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize the excess of an acquired business’s cost over
the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill as discussed below under “Goodwill.”
We use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and
liabilities. We generally use third-party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives of
property and identifiable intangibles, consulting actuaries to determine the fair value of
obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans, and legal counsel to assess obligations
associated with legal and environmental claims.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”).
SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective
for our financial assets and liabilities on December 30, 2007. The FASB approved a one-year
deferral of the adoption of SFAS 157 as it relates to non-financial assets and liabilities with the
issuance in February 2008 of FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement
No. 157, as a result of which implementation by us is now required on January 4, 2009. The



partial adoption of SFAS 157 in the first quarter ended March 29, 2008 had no material impact
on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, but resulted in certain additional
disclosures reflected in Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are in the process of
evaluating the impact of SFAS 157 as it relates to our non-financial assets and liabilities.

SFAS 157 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. We utilize market data or assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair
value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include:
Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as
inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly
observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs about which little or no market data
exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of three valuation
techniques noted in SFAS 157. The three valuation techniques are as follows:

•

Market approach — prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

•

Cost approach — amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an
asset or replacement cost.

•

Income approach — techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based
on market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing and other
models.

We primarily apply the market approach for commodity derivatives and the income approach for
interest rate and foreign currency derivatives for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to
utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs.

As of January 3, 2009, we held certain financial assets and liabilities that are required to
be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These consisted of our derivative instruments
related to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The fair values of cotton derivatives are
determined based on quoted prices in public markets and are categorized as Level 1, however, we did
not have any outstanding cotton derivatives outstanding at January 3, 2009. The fair values of
interest rate and foreign exchange rate derivatives are determined based on inputs that are readily
available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets
and are categorized as Level 2. We do not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair
value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 3
during the year ended January 3, 2009. There were no changes during the year ended January 3, 2009
to our valuation techniques used to measure asset and liability fair values on a recurring basis.
See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the amounts at fair value as of January 3,
2009.

As required by SFAS 157, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect
the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value
hierarchy levels. The determination of fair values incorporates various factors required under
SFAS 157. These factors include not only the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the
impact of credit enhancements, but also the impact of our nonperformance risk on our liabilities.

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
(“SFAS 141R”). The objective of SFAS 141R is to improve the relevance, representational
faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a company provides in its financial reports
about a business combination and its effects. Under SFAS 141R, a company would be required to
recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent
consideration measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. It further requires that
research and development assets acquired in a business combination that have no alternative future
use be measured at their acquisition-date fair value and then immediately charged to expense, and
that acquisition-related costs are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as
incurred. Among other changes, this statement would



also require that “negative goodwill” be recognized in earnings as a gain attributable to the
acquisition, and any deferred tax benefits resulting from a business combination be recognized in
income from continuing operations in the period of the combination. SFAS 141R is effective for
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). The objective of this Statement
is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a
company provides in its consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 requires a company to clearly
identify and present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in
the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company’s
equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to
the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated
statement of income; that changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as equity
transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, that any retained noncontrolling equity
investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary
be measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We do not believe that the adoption of
SFAS 160 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 expands the
disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 133 about an entity’s derivative instruments and
hedging activities to include more detailed qualitative disclosures and expanded quantitative
disclosures. The provisions of SFAS 161 are effective for fiscal years and interim periods
beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 161 will not have a material impact on our
results of operations.

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 132(R)-1, Employers’ Disclosures
about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (“FSP 132(R)-1”).  FSP 132(R)-1 will require additional
disclosures about the major categories of plan assets and concentrations of risk, as well as
disclosure of fair value levels, similar to the disclosure requirements of SFAS 157.  The enhanced
disclosures about plan assets required by FSP 132(R)-1 must be provided in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ending January 2, 2010.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices. Our risk management control system uses analytical techniques including market
value, sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars; however, we
purchase some raw materials, pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain
in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the
Canadian dollar, European euro, Mexican peso and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. We use
foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in
foreign exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the effect that
changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our forward and option
contracts. At January 3, 2009, the potential change in fair value of foreign currency derivative
instruments, assuming a 10% adverse change in the underlying currency price, was $4.5 million.



Interest Rates

We are required under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Second Lien Credit Facility
to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate
debt issuance. At January 3, 2009, we have outstanding hedging arrangements whereby we capped the
LIBOR interest rate component on $400 million of our floating rate debt at 3.50%. We also entered
into interest rate swaps tied to the 3-month and 6-month LIBOR rates whereby we fixed the LIBOR
interest rate component on an aggregate of $1.4 billion of our floating rate debt at a blended rate
of approximately 4.16%. Approximately 82% of our total debt outstanding at January 3, 2009 is at a
fixed or capped rate. After giving effect to these arrangements, a 25-basis point movement in the
annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of January 3, 2009 would result in
a change in annual interest expense of $2.0 million.

Due to the recent significant changes in the credit markets, the fair values of our interest
rate hedging instruments have decreased approximately $66.7 million during the year ended January
3, 2009. This activity has been deferred into Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged transactions impact our earnings.

Commodities

Cotton, which represents 8% of our cost of sales, is the primary raw material we use to
manufacture many of our products. While we attempt to protect our business from the volatility of
the market price of cotton through short-term supply agreements and hedges from time to time, our
business can be adversely affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices. The price of cotton
currently in our inventory is in the mid 60 cents per pound range which is the price that will
impact our operating results in the first half of 2009. The prices for the most recent cotton crop,
which will impact our operating results in the second half of 2009, have decreased to the low 50
cents per pound range. The ultimate effect of these pricing levels on our earnings cannot be
quantified, as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain,
but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, fluctuations in
crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture
our products, such as chemicals, dyestuffs, polyester yarn and foam. We generally purchase our raw
materials at market prices. We use commodity financial instruments to hedge the price of cotton,
for which there is a high correlation between costs and the financial instrument. We generally do
not use commodity financial instruments to hedge other raw material commodity prices. At January 3,
2009, we did not have any cotton commodity derivatives outstanding.

Hanesbrands Inc.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Hanesbrands Inc. (“Hanesbrands”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Hanesbrands’ system of internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of Hanesbrands; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of Hanesbrands are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Hanesbrands; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of Hanesbrands’ assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of Hanesbrands’ internal control over financial
reporting as of January 3, 2009, based upon criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on our evaluation, management
determined that Hanesbrands’ internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January
3, 2009.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2009 has
been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hanesbrands Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hanesbrands Inc. at January 3, 2009 and
December 29, 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended January 3, 2009, the six months ended December 30, 2006, and the year ended
July 1, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits which were integrated audits in 2008 and 2007. We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Notes 16 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed
the manner in which it accounts for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans
effective December 30, 2006, and changed the measurement date for its plan assets and benefit
obligations effective December 29, 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Background

On February 10, 2005, Sara Lee Corporation (“Sara Lee”) announced an overall transformation
plan which included spinning off Sara Lee’s apparel business in the Americas and Asia (the “Branded
Apparel Americas and Asia Business”). In connection with the spin off, Sara Lee incorporated
Hanesbrands Inc., a Maryland corporation (“Hanesbrands” and, together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, the “Company”), to which it would transfer the assets and liabilities related to the
Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business. On August 31, 2006, Sara Lee transferred to the Company
substantially all the assets and liabilities, at historical cost, comprising the Branded Apparel
Americas and Asia Business.

On September 5, 2006, as a condition to the distribution to Sara Lee’s stockholders of all of
the outstanding shares of the common stock of Hanesbrands, the Company distributed to Sara Lee a
cash dividend payment of $1,950,000 and repaid a loan from Sara Lee in the amount of $450,000, and
Sara Lee distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding shares of Hanesbrands’ common
stock, with each stockholder receiving one share of Hanesbrands’ common stock for each eight shares
of Sara Lee’s common stock that they held as of the August 18, 2006 record date. As a result of
such distribution, Sara Lee ceased to own any equity interest in the Company and the Company became
an independent, separately traded, publicly held company.

The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Hanesbrands Inc.
and its subsidiaries as a separate, stand alone entity subsequent to September 5, 2006, in addition
to the historical operations of the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business which were operated
as part of Sara Lee prior to the spin off. Under Sara Lee’s ownership, certain of the Branded
Apparel Americas and Asia Business’s operations were divisions of Sara Lee and not separate legal
entities, while the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business’s foreign operations were
subsidiaries of Sara Lee. A direct ownership relationship did not exist among the various units
comprising the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business prior to the spin off on September 5,
2006. Subsequent to the spin off on September 5, 2006, the Company began accumulating its retained
earnings and recognized the par value and paid-in-capital in connection with the issuance of
approximately 96,306 shares of common stock.

Prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006, the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business
utilized the services of Sara Lee for certain functions. These services included providing working
capital, as well as certain legal, finance, internal audit, financial reporting, tax advisory,
insurance, global information technology, environmental matters and human resource services,
including various corporate-wide employee benefit programs. The cost of these services has been
allocated to the Company and included in the Consolidated Financial Statements for periods prior to
the spin off on September 5, 2006. The allocations were determined on the basis which Sara Lee and
the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business considered to be reasonable reflections of the
utilization of services provided by Sara Lee. A more detailed discussion of the relationship with
Sara Lee prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006, including a description of the costs which
have been allocated to the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business, as well as the method of
allocation, is included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management believes the assumptions underlying the Consolidated Financial Statements for these
periods are reasonable. However, the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for the
periods through September 5, 2006 do not necessarily reflect the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia
Business’s operations and cash flows in the future or what its results of operations and cash flows
would have been had the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business
been a stand alone company
during the periods presented.

In October 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a change in the Company’s fiscal
year end from the Saturday closest to June 30 to the Saturday closest to December 31. As a result
of this change, the Consolidated Financial Statements include presentation of the transition period
beginning on July 2, 2006 and ending on December 30, 2006. Fiscal year 2008 included 53 weeks and
fiscal years 2007 and 2006 included 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to years relate
to fiscal years.

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its controlled
subsidiary companies which in general are majority owned entities, and the accounts of variable
interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary, as defined by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities

(FIN 46-R) and related interpretations. Excluded from the accounts of the Company
are Sara Lee entities which maintained legal ownership of certain of the Company’s divisions
(Parent Companies) until the spin off on September 5, 2006. The results of companies acquired or
disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the
effective date of acquisition, or up to the date of disposal. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company consolidates one VIE, an Israeli manufacturer and supplier of yarn. The Company
has a 49% ownership interest in the Israeli joint venture, however, based upon certain terms of the
supply contract, the Company has a disproportionate share of expected losses and residual returns.
The effect of consolidating this VIE was the inclusion of $11,042 of total assets and $7,534 of
total liabilities at January 3, 2009 and $11,903 of total assets and $8,351 of total liabilities at
December 29, 2007 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company reported a minority interest of $5,907 and $5,749 in the “Other noncurrent
liabilities” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets at January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007,
respectively.

months ended December 30, 2006

and year ended July 1, 2006

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

(b) Use of Estimates

The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, certain financial statement disclosures at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results may vary from these estimates.

(c) Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at
exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates. Translation adjustments resulting
from fluctuations in exchange rates are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity. The Company translates the results of operations of
its foreign operations at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. Gains and
losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, the amounts of which are not material for any
of the periods presented, are included in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line
of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

(d) Sales Recognition and Incentives

The Company recognizes revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii)
the sales price is fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been
transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, which
occurs primarily upon shipment. The Company records a sales reduction for returns and allowances
based upon historical return experience. The Company earns royalty revenues through license
agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate certain of the Company’s
brands. The Company accrues revenue earned under these contracts based upon reported sales from the
licensee. The Company offers a variety of sales incentives to resellers and consumers of its
products, and the policies regarding the recognition and display of these incentives within the
Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:

Discounts, Coupons, and Rebates

The Company recognizes the cost of these incentives at the later of the date at which the
related sale is recognized or the date at which the incentive is offered. The cost of these
incentives is estimated using a number of factors, including historical utilization and redemption
rates. All cash incentives of this type are included in the determination of net sales. The Company
includes incentives offered in the form of free products in the determination of cost of sales.

Volume-Based Incentives

These incentives typically involve rebates or refunds of cash that are redeemable only if the
reseller completes a specified number of sales transactions. Under these incentive programs, the
Company estimates the anticipated rebate to be paid and allocates a portion of the estimated cost
of the rebate to each underlying sales transaction with the customer. The Company includes these
amounts in the determination of net sales.

Cooperative Advertising

Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to reimburse the reseller for a portion of the
costs incurred by the reseller to advertise and promote certain of the Company’s products. The
Company recognizes the cost of cooperative advertising programs in the period in which the
advertising and promotional activity first takes place.

Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, six
months ended December 30, 2006

and year ended July 1, 2006

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

For the year ended December 29, 2007, the Company changed the manner in which it accounted for cooperative advertising that resulted in a
change in the classification from media, advertising and promotion expenses to a reduction in
sales. This change in classification was made in accordance with EITF 01-9,

Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products),

because the estimated fair value of the identifiable benefit was no longer obtained beginning in 2007.

Fixtures and Racks

Store fixtures and racks are periodically used by resellers to display Company products. The
Company expenses the cost of these fixtures and racks in the period in which they are delivered to
the resellers. The Company includes the costs of fixtures and racks incurred by resellers and
charged back to the Company in the determination of net sales. Fixtures and racks purchased by the
Company and provided to resellers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

(e) Advertising Expense

Advertising costs, which include the development and production of advertising materials and
the communication of these materials through various forms of media, are expensed in the period the
advertising first takes place. The Company recognized advertising expense in the “Selling, general
and administrative expenses” caption in the Consolidated Statements of Income of $187,034 in the
year ended January 3, 2009 and $188,327 in the year ended December 29, 2007, $99,786 in the six
months ended December 30, 2006 and $190,934 in the year ended July 1, 2006.

(f) Shipping and Handling Costs

Revenue received for shipping and handling costs is included in net sales and was $24,244 in
the year ended January 3, 2009, $22,751 in the year ended December 29, 2007, $11,711 in the six
months ended December 30, 2006 and $20,405 in the year ended July 1, 2006. Shipping costs, that
comprise payments to third party shippers, and handling costs, which consist of warehousing costs
in the Company’s various distribution facilities, were $238,340 in the year ended January 3, 2009,
$234,070 in the year ended December 29, 2007, $123,850 in the six months ended December 30, 2006
and $235,690 in the year ended July 1, 2006. The Company recognizes shipping, handling and
distribution costs in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

(g) Catalog Expenses

The Company incurs expenses for printing catalogs for products to aid in the Company’s sales
efforts. The Company initially records these expenses as a prepaid item and charges it against
selling, general and administrative expenses over time as the catalog is used. Expenses are
recognized at a rate that approximates historical experience with regard to the timing and amount
of sales attributable to a catalog distribution.

(h) Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in the “Selling,
general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. Research and
development expense was $46,460 in the year ended January 3, 2009, $45,409 in the year ended
December 29, 2007, $23,460 in the six months ended December 30, 2006 and $54,571 in the year ended
July 1, 2006.

Years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, six
months ended December 30, 2006

and year ended July 1, 2006

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

(i) Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase
are considered to be cash equivalents.

(j) Accounts Receivable Valuation

Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful
accounts reflects the Company’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts
receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for
known troubled accounts and other currently available information.

(k) Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Rebates, discounts and other cash
consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in
the cost of the related inventory item, and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the
related inventory item is sold. During the six months ended December 30, 2006, the Company elected
to convert all inventory valued by the last-in, first-out, or “LIFO,” method to the first-in,
first-out, or “FIFO,” method. In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

(SFAS 154), a change from the LIFO to FIFO
method of inventory valuation constitutes a change in accounting principle. Historically, inventory
valued under the LIFO method, which was 4% of total inventories, would have the same value if
measured under the FIFO method. Therefore, the conversion has no retrospective reporting impact.

(l) Property

Property is stated at historical cost and depreciation expense is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment is
depreciated over periods ranging from three to 25 years and buildings and building improvements
over periods of up to 40 years. A change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in
accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and
future periods. Additions and improvements that substantially extend the useful life of a
particular asset and interest costs incurred during the construction period of major properties are
capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or disposition of an
asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts.

Property is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in
the business climate, several periods of operating or cash flow losses, forecasted continuing
losses or a current expectation that an asset or an asset group will be disposed of before the end
of its useful life. Recoverability of property is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount
of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset or asset group. If these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable, the
impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the
adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful life. Restoration
of a previously recognized impairment loss is not permitted under U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

(m) Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

The primary identifiable intangible assets of the Company are trademarks and computer
software. Identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives
are not amortized. The estimated useful life of a finite-lived intangible asset is based upon a
number of factors, including the effects of demand, competition, expected changes in distribution
channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash

flows.Finite-lived trademarks are being amortized over periods ranging from five to 30 years, while
computer software is being amortized over periods ranging from two to ten years.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs under the provisions of AICPA
Statement of Position 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use.

Capitalized computer software costs include the actual costs to purchase software
from vendors and generally include personnel and related costs for employees who were directly
associated with the enhancement and implementation of purchased computer software. Additions to
computer software are included in purchases of property and equipment in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.

Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment
using a process similar to that used in evaluating elements of property. Identifiable intangible
assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering
events occur. The impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization
consists of comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. An impairment
loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair
value of the asset. In assessing fair value, management relies on a number of factors to
discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results, business plans and present
value techniques. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost
of capital at a point in time. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and
management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of intangible asset impairment.

(n) Goodwill

Goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. When a business combination is
completed, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to the reporting unit or units
of the Company given responsibility for managing, controlling and generating returns on these
assets and liabilities. The Company has determined that the reporting units are at the operating
segment level. In many instances, all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are assigned
to a single reporting unit and in these cases all of the goodwill is assigned to the same reporting
unit. In those situations in which the acquired assets and liabilities are allocated to more than
one reporting unit, the goodwill to be assigned to each reporting unit is determined in a manner
similar to how the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined.

Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is assessed for impairment at least annually and as
triggering events occur. The Company’s annual measurement date is the first day of the third
fiscal quarter. The first step involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its
carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step
of the process involves comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value of the goodwill of
that reporting unit. If the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied
fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess.

In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair values of
the reporting units. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors to
discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results, business plans and present
value techniques. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost
of capital at a point in time. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and
management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

(o) Stock-Based Compensation

The employees of the Company participated in the stock-based compensation plans of Sara Lee
prior to the Company’s spin off on September 5, 2006. In connection with the spin off, the Company
established the Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2006, (the “Hanesbrands OIP”) to award
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock
units, performance shares and cash to its employees, non-employee directors and employees of its
subsidiaries to promote the interests of the Company and incent performance and retention of
employees.

months ended December 30, 2006

and year ended July 1, 2006

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)) the Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in
exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of those awards.

(p) Income Taxes

For the periods prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006, income taxes were prepared on a
separate return basis as if the Company had been a group of separate legal entities. As a result,
actual tax transactions that would not have occurred had the Company been a separate entity have
been eliminated in the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for such periods. Until the
Company entered into a tax sharing agreement with Sara Lee in connection with the spin off, there
was no formal tax sharing agreement between the Company and Sara Lee. The tax sharing agreement
allocates responsibilities between the Company and Sara Lee for taxes and certain other tax
matters. Under the tax sharing agreement, Sara Lee generally is liable for all U.S. federal, state,
local and foreign income taxes attributable to the Company with respect to taxable periods ending
on or before September 5, 2006. Sara Lee also is liable for income taxes attributable to the
Company with respect to taxable periods beginning before September 5, 2006 and ending after
September 5, 2006, but only to the extent those taxes are allocable to the portion of the taxable
period ending on September 5, 2006. The Company is generally liable for all other taxes
attributable to it. Changes in the amounts payable or receivable by the Company under the
stipulations of this agreement may impact the Company’s financial position and cash flows in any
period.

Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between
financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences
are expected to reverse. Given continuing losses in certain jurisdictions in which the Company
operates on a separate return basis, a valuation allowance has been established for the deferred
tax assets in these specific locations. Net operating loss carryforwards, charitable contribution
carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards have been determined in these Consolidated Financial
Statements as if the Company had been a group of legal entities separate from Sara Lee, which
results in different carryforward amounts than those shown by Sara Lee. The Company periodically
estimates the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and
informed judgment. There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax
regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company transacts business. The judgments and
estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes
to, or further interpretations of, regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in
which these events occur, and these adjustments are included in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Income. If such changes take place, there is a risk that the Company’s effective tax
rate may increase or decrease in any period. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Interpretation 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), which
became effective during the year ended December 29, 2007. FIN 48 addresses the determination of how
tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
statements. Under FIN 48, a company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a
greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The impact of the
reassessment of the Company’s tax positions in accordance with FIN 48 did not have a material
impact on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

(q) Financial Instruments

The Company uses financial instruments, including forward exchange, option and swap contracts,
to manage its exposures to movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity
prices. The use of these financial instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent
to reduce the risk or cost to the Company. The Company does not use derivatives for trading
purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative contracts.

The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedging
instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for
undertaking the hedge transaction.

This process includes linking derivatives that are designated as
hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company
also formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in
either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative
ceases to be a highly effective hedge, or if the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to
occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any deferred gains or losses are recorded in the “Selling, general and
administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value in other assets and
other liabilities. The fair value is based upon either market quotes for actively traded
instruments or independent bids for nonexchange traded instruments.

On the date the derivative is entered into, the Company designates the type of derivative as a
fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, net investment hedge or a mark to market hedge, and accounts for
the derivative in accordance with its designation.

Mark to Market Hedge

A derivative used as a hedging instrument whose change in fair value is recognized to act as
an economic hedge against changes in the values of the hedged item is designated a mark to market
hedge. For derivatives designated as mark to market hedges, changes in fair value are reported in
earnings in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements
of Income. Forward exchange contracts are recorded as mark to market hedges when the hedged item is
a recorded asset or liability that is revalued in each accounting period, in accordance with SFAS
No. 52,

Foreign Currency Translation.

Cash Flow Hedge

A hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid
related to a recognized asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge. The effective
portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is
recorded in the “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
When the hedged item affects the income statement, the gain or loss included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) is reported on the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Income
as the hedged item. In addition, both the fair value of changes excluded from the Company’s
effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of
derivatives used as cash flow hedges are reported in the “Selling, general and administrative
expenses” line in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

(r) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 was effective
for the Company’s financial assets and liabilities on December 30, 2007. The FASB approved a
one-year deferral of the adoption of SFAS 157 as it relates to non-financial assets and liabilities
with the issuance in February 2008 of FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 157, as a result of which implementation by the Company is now required on January 4,
2009. The partial adoption of SFAS 157 in the first quarter ended March 29, 2008 had no material
impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company, but resulted
in certain additional disclosures reflected in Note15. The Company is in the process of evaluating
the impact of SFAS 157 as it relates to its non-financial assets and liabilities.

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS
141R”). The objective of SFAS 141R is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and
comparability of the information that a company provides in its financial reports about a business
combination and its effects. Under SFAS 141R, a company would be required to recognize the assets
acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration measured at their
fair value at the acquisition
date. It further requires that research and development assets acquired in a business combination
that have no alternative future use be measured at their acquisition-date fair value and then
immediately charged to expense, and that acquisition-related costs are to be recognized separately
from the acquisition and expensed as incurred. Among other changes, this statement would also
require that “negative goodwill” be recognized in earnings as a gain attributable to the
acquisition, and any deferred tax benefits resulting from a business combination be recognized in
income from continuing operations in the period of the combination. SFAS 141R is effective for
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). The objective of this Statement
is to improve the relevance, comparability, and transparency of the financial information that a
company provides in its consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 requires a company to clearly
identify and present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in
the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company’s
equity. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to
the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated
statement of income; that changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly, as equity
transactions; and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, that any retained noncontrolling equity
investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary
be measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company does not believe that the
adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial
position.

Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 expands the
disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 133 about an entity’s derivative instruments and
hedging activities to include more detailed qualitative disclosures and expanded quantitative
disclosures. The provisions of SFAS 161 are effective for fiscal years and interim periods
beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 161 will not have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 132(R)-1, Employers’ Disclosures
about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (“FSP 132(R)-1”). FSP 132(R)-1 will require additional
disclosures about the major categories of plan assets and concentrations of risk, as well as
disclosure of fair value levels, similar to the disclosure requirements of SFAS 157. The enhanced
disclosures about plan assets required by FSP 132(R)-1 must be provided in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ending January 2, 2010.

(s) Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements, none of which are
material, have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These
reclassifications within the footnote disclosures, which relate to changes in the classification of
inventory, segment assets, segment depreciation and amortization expense and segment additions to
long-lived assets, had no impact on the Company’s results of operations.

(3) Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) was computed by dividing net income by the number of weighted
average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS was calculated to give
effect to all potentially dilutive shares of common stock. The reconciliation of basic to diluted
weighted average shares for the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 and the six
months ended December 30, 2006 is as follows:

Options to purchase 3,735, 1,163 and 1,832 shares of common stock were excluded from the
diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect would be anti-dilutive for the years
ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 and six months ended December 30, 2006, respectively.

For the year ended July 1, 2006, basic and diluted EPS were computed using the number of
shares of Hanesbrands stock outstanding on September 5, 2006, the date on which Hanesbrands common
stock was distributed to stockholders of Sara Lee in connection with the spin off.

(4) Stock-Based Compensation

The Company established the Hanesbrands OIP to award stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash to its
employees, non-employee directors and employees of its subsidiaries to promote the interests of the
Company and incent performance and retention of employees.

Stock
Options

The exercise price of each stock option equals the closing market price of Hanesbrands’ stock
on the date of grant. Options can generally be exercised over a term of between five and 10 years.
Options vest ratably over two to three years with the exception of one category of award made in
September 2006 which vested immediately upon grant. The fair value of each option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following table
illustrates the assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model used in determining the fair
value of options granted during the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 and six
months ended December 30, 2006, respectively.

The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s current intent not to pay dividends.
The Company uses a combination of the volatility of the Company and the volatility of peer
companies for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine
volatility assumptions due to the limited trading history of the Company’s common stock since the
Company’s spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006. The Company utilized the simplified method
outlined in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 to estimate expected lives for options granted.
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, which was issued in December 2007, amends SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107 and gives a limited extension on using the simplified method for
valuing stock option grants to eligible public companies that do not have sufficient historical
exercise patterns on options granted to employees.

During 2008, after consultation with its compensation consultants, the Compensation Committee
of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) determined to make decisions
regarding 2009 compensation for executive officers at its meeting in December 2008, so that such
decisions could be made prior to the January 1, 2009 effective date for any changes in total
compensation opportunities rather than retroactively, and to approve equity grants simultaneously
with those decisions. Regarding 2008 compensation, the Compensation Committee made decisions and
approved equity grants at its meeting in January 2008. Therefore, two equity awards, including
awards of stock options, were made to executive officers and other employees during the year ended
January 3, 2009.

There were 968, 634 and 1,123 options that vested during the years ended January 3, 2009 and
December 29, 2007 and six months ended December 30, 2006, respectively. The total intrinsic value

during the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 and the six months ended December

ended December 30, 2006 was $6.29, $7.83 and $6.55, respectively.

Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for the years
ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 and the six months ended December 30, 2006 was $2,191,
$6,189 and $139, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option
exercise of the share-based payment arrangements totaled $806, $1,503 and $8 for the years ended
January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 and the six months ended December 30, 2006, respectively.

Stock Unit Awards

Restricted stock units (RSUs) of Hanesbrands’ stock are granted to certain Company employees
and non-employee directors to incent performance and retention over periods ranging from one to
three years. Upon vesting, the RSUs are converted into shares of the Company’s common stock on a
one-for-one basis and issued to the grantees. All RSUs which have been granted under the
Hanesbrands OIP vest solely upon continued future service to the Company. The cost of these awards
is determined using the fair value of the shares on the date of grant, and compensation expense is
recognized over the period during which the grantees provide the requisite service to the Company.

HANESBRANDS

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, six months ended December 30, 2006

and year ended July 1, 2006

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29,
2007 and the six months ended December 30, 2006 was $13,560,
$9,853 and $0, respectively. Certain
participants elected to defer receipt of shares earned upon vesting. As of January 3, 2009, a total
of 73 shares of common stock are issuable in future years for such deferrals.

For all share-based payments under the Hanesbrands OIP, during the years ended January 3, 2009
and December 29, 2007 and the six months ended December 30, 2006, the Company recognized total
compensation expense of $31,002, $33,185 and $10,176 and recognized a deferred tax benefit of
$11,585, $12,360 and $3,842, respectively. At January 3, 2009, there was $34,485 of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements, of
which $28,508, $4,861 and $1,116 is expected to be recognized in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.
The Company satisfies the requirement for common shares for share-based payments to employees
pursuant to the Hanesbrands OIP by issuing newly authorized shares. The Hanesbrands OIP authorized
13,105 shares for awards of stock options and restricted stock units, of which 3,547 were available
for future grants as of January 3, 2009.

The employees of the Company participated in the stock-based compensation plans of Sara Lee
prior to the Company’s spin off on September 5, 2006. As a result of the spin off and consistent
with the terms of the awards under Sara Lee’s plans, the outstanding Sara Lee stock options granted
expired six months after the spin off date. In connection with the spin off, vesting for all
nonvested service-based Sara Lee RSUs was accelerated to the spin off date resulting in the
recognition of $5,447 of additional compensation expense for the six months ended December 30,
2006. An insignificant number of performance-based Sara Lee RSUs remained unvested through the spin
off date.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

During April 2007, the Company implemented the Hanesbrands Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
of 2006 (the “ESPP”), which is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. An
aggregate of up to 2,442 shares of Hanesbrands common stock may be purchased by eligible employees
pursuant to the ESPP. The purchase price for shares under the ESPP is equal to 85% of the stock’s
fair market value on the purchase date. During the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29,
2007, 129 and 78 shares, respectively, were purchased under the ESPP by eligible employees. The
Company had 2,235 shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP as of January 3, 2009. The
Company recognized $447 and $440 of stock compensation expense under the ESPP during the years
ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, respectively.

(5) Restructuring

Since becoming an independent company, the Company has undertaken a variety of restructuring
efforts in connection with its consolidation and globalization strategy designed to improve
operating efficiencies and lower
costs. As a result of this strategy, the Company expects to incur approximately $250,000 in
restructuring and related charges over the three year period following the spin off from Sara Lee
on September 5, 2006, of which approximately half is expected to be noncash. As of January 3, 2009,
the Company has recognized approximately $209,000 and announced approximately $219,000 in
restructuring and related charges related to this strategy since September 5, 2006. Of these
charges, approximately $84,000 relates to accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment for
facilities that have been or will be closed, approximately $79,000 relates to employee termination
and other benefits, approximately $19,000 relates to write-offs of stranded raw materials and work
in process inventory determined not to be salvageable or cost-effective to relocate, approximately
$17,000 relates to lease termination and other costs and approximately $10,000 relates to
impairments of fixed assets. Accelerated depreciation related to the Company’s manufacturing
facilities and distribution centers that have been or will be closed is reflected in the “Cost of
sales” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” lines of the Consolidated Statements of
Income. The write-offs of stranded raw materials and work in process inventory are reflected in the
“Cost of sales” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The accrual balance as of January 3, 2009 is comprised of $21,381 in current accrued
liabilities and $412 in other noncurrent liabilities. The $21,381 in current accrued liabilities
consists of $19,006 for employee termination and other benefits and $2,375 for noncancelable leases
and other contractual obligations. The $412 in other
noncurrent liabilities is related to noncancelable leases and other contractual obligations.

Adjustments to previous estimates resulted from actual costs to settle obligations being lower
than expected. The adjustments were reflected in the “Restructuring” line of the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Year Ended January 3, 2009 Restructuring Actions

During the year ended January 3, 2009, the Company approved actions to close 11 manufacturing
facilities and three distribution centers and eliminate approximately 6,800 positions in Mexico,
the United States, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador. The production capacity represented by the
manufacturing facilities has been relocated to lower cost locations in Asia, Central America and
the Caribbean Basin. The distribution capacity has been relocated to the Company’s West Coast
distribution facility in California in order to expand capacity for goods the Company sources from
Asia. In addition, approximately 200 management and administrative positions were eliminated, with
the majority of these positions based in the United States. All actions are expected to be
completed within a 12-month period. The Company recorded charges of $87,117 in the year ended
January 3, 2009. The Company recognized $37,190 which represents employee termination and other
benefits recognized in accordance with benefit plans previously communicated to the affected
employee group, $18,696 for write-offs of stranded raw materials and work in process inventory
determined not to be salvageable or cost-effective to relocate related to the closure of certain

Year Ended December 29, 2007 Restructuring Actions

During the year ended December 29, 2007, the Company, in connection with its consolidation and
globalization strategy, approved actions to close 16 manufacturing facilities and three
distribution centers in the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the United States, Brazil and Canada. All
actions are expected to be completed within a 12-month period. The net impact of these actions was
to reduce income before income tax expense by $70,050 in the year ended December 29, 2007. As of
January 3, 2009, 6,241 employees had been terminated and the severance obligation remaining in
accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $803. The lease termination and other
contractual obligations remaining in accrued restructuring on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
January 3, 2009 was $193.

During the year ended January 3, 2009, the Company recognized additional restructuring charges
associated with plant closures announced in the year ended December 29, 2007, resulting in a
decrease of $8,661 to net income before income tax expenses.

The Company recognized charges of $10,484 in the year ended January 3, 2009 for accelerated
depreciation of buildings and equipment associated with plant closures. The additional charges are
reflected in the “Cost of sales” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” lines of the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company recognized $661 in the year ended January 3, 2009, which represents charges for
lease termination costs, other contractual obligations and other restructuring related expenses.
These charges are reflected in the “Restructuring” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the year ended January 3, 2009, certain actions were completed for amounts more
favorable than originally estimated, resulting in an increase of $2,484 to income before income
taxes. The $2,484 consists of a credit for employee termination and other benefits and resulted
from actual costs to settle obligations being lower than expected. The adjustment is reflected in
the “Restructuring” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Six Months Ended December 30, 2006 Restructuring Actions

During the six months ended December 30, 2006, the Company, in connection with its plans to
migrate portions of its manufacturing operations to lower-cost manufacturing facilities, to improve
alignment of sewing operations with the flow of textiles and to consolidate production capacity,
approved various actions resulting in the closure of seven facilities. The seven facilities include
four textile and sewing plants in the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico and the three
distribution centers in the United States. All actions were to be completed within a 12-month
period after being approved. In the six months ended December 30, 2006, these actions reduced
income before income tax expense by $33,289. As of January 3, 2009, all of the employees had been
terminated.

During the year ended December 29, 2007, the Company recognized additional restructuring
charges associated with plant closures announced in the six months ended December 30, 2006,

charges of $10,404 for lease termination costs associated with plant closures announced in the six
months ended December 30, 2006, for facilities which were exited in the year ended December 29,
2007. The additional charges are reflected in the “Cost of sales” and “Restructuring” lines of the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

During the year ended January 3, 2009, certain actions were completed for amounts more
favorable than originally estimated, resulting in an increase of $2,698 to income before income
taxes. The $2,698 consists of a credit of $24 for employee termination and other benefits resulting
from actual costs to settle obligations being lower than expected, a credit of $1,093 to
accelerated depreciation as a result of proceeds from sales of fixed assets to which accelerated
depreciation was previously charged exceeding previous estimates, a credit of $2,295 to lease
termination costs as a result of costs to settle the obligation being lower than expected and a
charge of $714 to fixed asset impairments related to the closure of certain manufacturing
facilities. The charges and adjustments are reflected in the “Restructuring,” “Cost of sales” and
“Selling, general and administrative expenses” lines of the Consolidated Statement of Income.

In connection with the spin off on September 5, 2006, the Company entered into a $2,150,000
senior secured credit facility (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”), a $450,000 senior secured
second lien credit facility (the “Second Lien Credit Facility”) and a $500,000 bridge loan facility
(the “Bridge Loan Facility”). The Bridge Loan Facility was paid off in full through the issuance of
$500,000 of floating rate senior notes (the “Floating Rate Senior Notes”) issued in December 2006.
On November 27, 2007, we entered into an accounts receivable securitization facility (“the
Receivables Facility”), which provides for up to $250,000 in funding accounted for as a secured
borrowing, limited to the availability of eligible receivables, and is secured by certain domestic
trade receivables. The outstanding balances at January 3, 2009 are reported in the “Long-term debt”
and “Current portion of long-term debt” lines of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Total cash paid for interest related to the long-term debt during the years ended January 3,
2009 and December 29, 2007 and the six months ended December 30, 2006 was $150,898, $165,331 and
$68,569, respectively.

Senior Secured Credit Facility

The Senior Secured Credit Facility initially provided for aggregate borrowings of $2,150,000,
consisting of: (i) a $250,000 Term A loan facility (the “Term A Loan Facility”); (ii) a $1,400,000
Term B loan facility (the “Term B Loan Facility”); and (iii) a $500,000 revolving loan facility
(the “Revolving Loan Facility”). The Senior Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially
all of Hanesbrands’ U.S. subsidiaries and is secured by equity interests in substantially all of
Hanesbrands’ direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the voting securities of certain

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

foreign subsidiaries and substantially all present and future assets of Hanesbrands and the
guarantors. At the Company’s option, borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility may be
maintained from time to time as (a) Base Rate loans, which shall bear interest at the higher of (i)
1/2 of 1% in excess of the federal funds rate and (ii) the rate published in the Wall Street
Journal as the “prime rate” (or equivalent), in each case in effect from time to time, plus the
applicable margin in effect from time to time (which is currently 0.50% for the Term A Loan
Facility and the Revolving Loan Facility and 0.75% for the Term B Loan Facility), or (b) LIBOR
based loans, which shall bear interest at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit
Facility and adjusted for maximum reserves), as determined by the administrative agent for the
respective interest period plus the applicable margin in effect from time to time (which is
currently 1.50% for the Term A Loan Facility and the Revolving Loan Facility and 1.75% for the Term
B Loan Facility). The final maturity of the Term A Loan Facility is September 5, 2012. The Term A
Loan Facility amortizes in an amount per annum equal to the following: year 1 — 5.00%; year 2 —
10.00%; year 3 — 15.00%; year 4 — 20.00%; year 5 — 25.00%; year 6 — 25.00%. The final maturity
of the Term B Loan Facility is September 5, 2013. The Term B Loan Facility is payable in equal
quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1% per annum, with the balance due on the maturity
date. The final maturity of the Revolving Loan Facility is September 5, 2011. As of January 3,
2009, the Company had $0 outstanding under the Revolving Loan Facility, $37,134 of standby and
trade letters of credit issued and outstanding under this facility and $462,866 of borrowing
availability. At January 3, 2009, the interest rates on the Term A Loan Facility and the Term B
Loan Facility were 5.02% and 5.19% respectively. Outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured
Credit Facility are prepayable without penalty.

On February 22, 2007, the Company entered into a First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to
the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the “applicable margin” with
respect to the $1,400,000 Term B loan facility (“Term B Loan Facility”) that comprises a part of
the Senior Secured Credit Facility was reduced from 2.25% to 1.75% with respect to loans maintained
as “LIBO Rate loans,” and from 1.25% to 0.75% with respect to loans maintained as “Base Rate
loans.”

On August 21, 2008, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the
Senior Secured Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the amount of unsecured
indebtedness which the Company and its subsidiaries that are obligors pursuant to the Senior
Secured Credit Facility may incur under senior notes was increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000. The
provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility which require the proceeds of the issuance of any
such notes be applied to repay amounts due with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, and
specify how any such proceeds will be applied, remain unchanged.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with customary affirmative,
negative, and financial covenants, and includes customary events of default. As of January 3, 2009,
the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

Second Lien Credit Facility

The Second Lien Credit Facility provides for aggregate borrowings of $450,000 by Hanesbrands’
wholly-owned subsidiary, HBI Branded Apparel Limited, Inc. The Second Lien Credit Facility is
unconditionally guaranteed by Hanesbrands and each entity guaranteeing the Senior Secured Credit
Facility. The Second Lien Credit Facility and the guarantees in respect thereof are secured on a
second-priority basis (subordinate only to the Senior Secured Credit Facility and any permitted
additions thereto or refinancings thereof) by substantially all of the assets that secure the
Senior Secured Credit Facility. Loans under the Second Lien Credit Facility bear interest in the
same manner as those under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to a margin of 2.75% for
Base Rate loans and 3.75% for LIBOR based loans. The Second Lien Credit Facility matures on March
5, 2014, may not be prepaid prior to September 5, 2007, and includes premiums for prepayment of the
loan prior to September 5, 2009 based upon timing of the prepayments. The Second Lien Credit
Facility will not amortize and will be repaid in full on its maturity date. At January 3, 2009 the
interest rate on the Second Lien Credit Facility was 7.27%.

On August 21, 2008, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Second Lien Amendment”) to the
Second Lien Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Second Lien Amendment, the amount of unsecured
indebtedness which the

Company and its subsidiaries that are obligors pursuant to the Second Lien Credit Facility may
incur under senior notes was increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000. The provisions of the Second
Lien Credit Facility which require the proceeds of the issuance of any such notes be applied to
repay amounts due with respect to the Second Lien Credit Facility, and specify how any such
proceeds will be applied, remain unchanged. The Second Lien Credit Facility requires the Company to
comply with customary affirmative, negative, and financial covenants, and includes customary events
of default. As of January 3, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

Floating Rate Senior Notes

On December 14, 2006, the Company issued $500,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate
Senior Notes due 2014. The Floating Rate Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank
equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future unsubordinated
indebtedness. The Floating Rate Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate, reset semi-annually,
equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 3.375%. Interest is payable on the
Floating Rate Senior Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning on June 15, 2007. The
Floating Rate Senior Notes will mature on December 15, 2014. The net proceeds from the sale of the
Floating Rate Senior Notes were approximately $492,000. These proceeds, together with working
capital, were used to repay in full the $500,000 outstanding under the Bridge Loan Facility. The
Floating Rate Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s domestic
subsidiaries. The Floating Rate Senior Notes are redeemable on or after December 15, 2008, subject
to premiums based upon timing of the prepayments. The Company repurchased $6,320 of the Floating
Rate Senior Notes for $4,354 resulting in a gain of $1,966 during the year ended January 3, 2009.

Accounts Receivable Securitization

On November 27, 2007, the Company entered into the Receivables Facility, which provides for up
to $250,000 in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing, limited to the availability of
eligible receivables, and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables. The Receivables
Facility will terminate on November 27, 2010. Under the terms of the Receivables Facility, the
company sells, on a revolving basis, certain domestic trade receivables to HBI Receivables LLC
(“Receivables LLC”), a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that in turn uses the trade
receivables to secure the borrowings, which are funded through conduits that issue commercial paper
in the short-term market and are not affiliated with the Company or through committed bank
purchasers if the conduits fail to fund. The assets and liabilities of Receivables LLC are fully
reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the securitization is treated as a secured
borrowing for accounting purposes. The borrowings under the Receivables Facility remain outstanding
throughout the term of the agreement subject to the Company maintaining sufficient eligible
receivables, by continuing to sell trade receivables to Receivables LLC, unless an event of default
occurs.

Availability of funding under the facility depends primarily upon the eligible outstanding
receivables balance. As of January 3, 2009, the Company had $242,617 outstanding under the
Receivables Facility. The outstanding balance under the Receivables Facility is reported on the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in long-term debt based on the three-year term of the
agreement and the fact that remittances on the receivables do not automatically reduce the
outstanding borrowings. All of the proceeds from the Receivables Facility were used to make a
prepayment of principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Unless the conduits fail to fund,
the yield on the commercial paper, which is the conduits’ cost to issue the commercial paper plus
certain dealer fees, is considered a financing cost and is included in interest expense on the
Consolidated Statement of Income. If the conduits fail to fund, the Receivables Facility would be
funded through committed bank purchasers, and the interest rate payable at the Company’s option at
the rate announced from time to time by JPMorgan as its prime rate or at the LIBO Rate (as defined
in the Receivables Facility) plus the applicable margin in effect from time to time. The average
blended interest rate for the year ended January 3, 2009 was 3.50%.

The Receivables Facility contains customary events of default and requires the Company to
maintain the same interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio as required by the Senior Secured
Credit Facility. As of January 3, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the debt instruments, which range from
five to eight years. As of January 3, 2009, the net carrying value was $24,776 which is included in
other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s debt issuance cost
amortization was $6,032, $6,475 and $2,279 for the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29,

January 3, 2009 which is comprised of a loss of $1,269 related to the prepayment of $125,000 on the
Senior Secured Credit Facility and $63 related to the repurchase of $6,320 of Floating Rate Senior
Notes. During the year ended December 29, 2007, the Company recognized $5,235 of losses on early
extinguishment of debt related to prepayments of $425,000 on the Senior Secured Credit Facility.
During the six months ended December 30, 2006, the Company recognized $7,401 of losses on early
extinguishment of debt which is comprised of a $6,125 loss for unamortized debt issuance costs on
the Bridge Loan Facility in connection with the issuance of the Floating Rate Senior Notes and a
$1,276 loss related to unamortized debt issuance costs on the Senior Secured Credit Facility for
the prepayment of $100,000 of principal in December 2006. As discussed above, the proceeds from the
issuance of the Floating Rate Senior Notes were used to repay the entire outstanding principal of
the Bridge Loan Facility.

In connection with the spin off on September 5, 2006, the Company assumed obligations relating
to the Company’s current and former employees included within Sara Lee sponsored pension and
retirement plans, including $53,813 of additional minimum pension liability that has not been
reflected in comprehensive
income for the six months ended December 30, 2006 but is, however, included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss at December 30, 2006.

During the six months ended December 30, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 158 which requires a
company to report the unfunded positions of employee benefit plans on the balance sheet while all
other deferred charges are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The
impact of adopting the SFAS 158 provision was $19,079, net of tax, which is not reflected in
comprehensive income but is, however, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December
30, 2006.

(12) Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is a party to various pending legal proceedings, claims and environmental actions
by government agencies. In accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, the Company
records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation, or proceeding when it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated. Any
provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the impact and status of
settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information pertinent to the particular matter.
The recorded liabilities for these items were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements
of the Company in any of the years presented. Although the outcome of such items cannot be
determined with certainty, the Company’s legal counsel and management are of the opinion that the
final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Operating Leases

The Company leases certain buildings and equipment under agreements that are classified as
operating leases. Rental expense under operating leases was $53,072 in the year ended January 3,
2009, $47,366 in the year ended December 29, 2007, $27,590 in the six months ended December 30,
2006 and $54,874 in the year ended July 1, 2006.

Years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, six months ended December 30, 2006

and year ended July 1, 2006

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases (with initial or remaining
lease terms in excess of one year) are as follows: $43,488 in 2009, $39,720 in 2010, $32,119 in
2011, $24,635 in 2012, $17,004 in 2013 and $69,666 thereafter.

During the year ended January 3, 2009, the Company entered into sale-leaseback transactions
involving two distribution centers and one manufacturing facility. The facilities are being leased
back over terms ranging from one to four years and are classified as operating leases. The Company
received net proceeds on the sales of $18,782, resulting in deferred gains of $6,317 which will be
amortized over the lease terms.

License Agreements

The Company is party to several royalty-bearing license agreements for use of third-party
trademarks in certain of their products. The license agreements typically require a minimum
guarantee to be paid either at the commencement of the agreement, by a designated date during the
term of the agreement or by the end of the agreement period. When payments are made in advance of
when they are due, the Company records a prepayment and amortizes the expense in the “Cost of sales” line of the Consolidated Statements of
Income uniformly over the guaranteed period. For guarantees required to be paid at the completion
of the agreement, royalties are expensed through “Cost of sales” as the related sales are made.
Management has reviewed all license agreements and concluded that these guarantees do not fall
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Interpretation No. 45

Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

,
and accordingly, there are no liabilities recorded at inception of the agreements.

For the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, the six months ended December 30,
2006 and the year ended July 1, 2006, the Company incurred royalty expense of approximately
$11,709, $11,583, $16,401 and $12,554, respectively. During the six months ended December 30, 2006,
the Company incurred expense of $9,675 in connection with the buy out of a license agreement and
the settlement of certain contractual terms relating to another license agreement. The $9,675 was
recorded in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statement
of Income.

Minimum amounts due under the license agreements are approximately $7,712 in 2009, $7,642 in
2010, $1,145 in 2011, $1,296 in 2012 and $120 in 2013. In addition to the minimum guaranteed
amounts under license agreements, in the year ended December 29, 2007 the Company entered into a
partnership agreement which included a minimum fee of $6,300 for each year from 2008 through 2017.

December 30, 2006 and $9,031 for the year ended July 1, 2006. The estimated amortization expense
for the next five years, assuming no change in the estimated useful lives of identifiable
intangible assets or changes in foreign exchange rates is as follows: $12,244 in 2009, $11,080 in
2010, $8,227 in 2011, $7,999 in 2012 and $7,963 in 2013.

There was no impairment of trademarks in any of the periods presented. However, in prior years
as a result of the annual impairment reviews, the Company concluded that certain trademarks had
lives that were no longer indefinite. As a result of this conclusion, trademarks with a net book
value of $79,044 for the year ended July 1, 2006 were moved from the indefinite lived category and
amortization was initiated over a 30-year period.

(b)  Goodwill

During the year ended January 3, 2009, the Company completed two business acquisitions: a
sewing operation in Thailand, and an embroidery and screen-printing production company in Honduras,
that resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $3,665 and $3,797, respectively.

During the year ended December 29, 2007, the Company completed two business acquisitions in El
Salvador: a textile manufacturing operation, and a sheer hosiery manufacturing company, that
resulted in the recognition of goodwill of $27,293 and $1,517, respectively. The Company
recognized $4,115 of additional goodwill for these acquisitions in the year ended January 3, 2009
upon completion of final purchase price allocations.

None of the preceding business acquisitions were determined by the Company to be material,
individually or in the aggregate, as set forth in SFAS No. 141,

Accounting for Business
Combinations

(SFAS 141). As a result, the disclosures and supplemental pro forma information
required by SFAS 141 are not presented.

(14)  Financial Instruments and Risk Management

(a)  Interest Rate Derivatives

In connection with the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006, the Company incurred debt
of $2,600,000 plus an unfunded revolver with capacity of $500,000, all of which bears interest at
floating rates. During the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 and the six months
ended December 30, 2006, the Company has executed certain interest rate cash flow hedges in the
form of swaps and caps in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to variability in cash flows for
the future interest payments on a designated portion of borrowings.

The Company records gains and losses on these derivative instruments using hedge accounting.
Under this accounting method, gains and losses are deferred into accumulated other comprehensive
loss until the hedged transaction impacts the Company’s earnings. However, on a quarterly basis
hedge ineffectiveness will be measured and any resulting ineffectiveness will be recorded as gains
or losses in the respective measurement period.

During the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 and the six months ended December
30, 2006, the Company deferred losses of $66,728, $16,357 and $2,743, respectively, into
accumulated other comprehensive loss. The tables below summarize our interest rate derivative
portfolio as of January 3, 2009.

and year ended July 1, 2006

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

(b)  Foreign Currency Derivatives

The Company uses forward exchange and option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating
foreign currencies on short-term foreign currency-denominated transactions, foreign
currency-denominated investments, other known foreign currency exposures and to reduce the effect
of fluctuating commodity prices on raw materials purchased for production. Gains and losses on
these contracts are intended to offset losses and gains on the hedged transaction in an effort to
reduce the earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and
fluctuating commodity prices. The Company also has foreign currency derivative instruments to which
hedge accounting is not applied. Gains and losses are recognized as the fair value of the
underlying derivatives changes and are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in
the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

Historically, the principal currencies hedged by the Company include the European euro,
Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. The following table summarizes by major currency
the contractual amounts of the Company’s foreign exchange forward contracts in U.S. dollars. The
bought amounts represent the net U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign
currencies, and the sold amounts represent the net U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell
foreign currencies. The foreign currency amounts have been translated into a U.S. dollar equivalent
value using the exchange rate at the reporting date. Forward exchange contracts mature on the
anticipated cash requirement date of the hedged transaction, generally within one year. The table
below summarizes our foreign currency derivative portfolio as of January 3, 2009.

The Company uses foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the foreign exchange fluctuations
on anticipated purchase and intercompany transactions. There were no open foreign exchange option
contracts at January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007.

(c)  Commodity Derivatives

Cotton is the primary raw material the Company uses to manufacture many of its products and is
purchased at market prices. In the year ended July 1, 2006, the Company started to use commodity
financial instruments to hedge the price of cotton, for which there is a high correlation between
the hedged item and the hedged instrument. There were no amounts outstanding under cotton futures
contracts at January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007. The Company had no cotton option contracts
outstanding at January 3, 2009. The notional amounts outstanding under the options contracts at
December 29, 2007 were 41 bales of cotton.

The Company expects to reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months net loss from
accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately $4,865 at the time the underlying hedged
transactions are realized. During the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, the six
months ended December 30, 2006 and the year ended July 1, 2006, the Company recognized income
(expense) of $(323), $80, $0 and $0, respectively, for hedge ineffectiveness related to cash flow
hedges. Amounts reported for hedge ineffectiveness are not included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss and therefore, not included in the above table.

There were no derivative losses excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or gains or
losses resulting from the disqualification of hedge accounting for the years ended January 3, 2009
and December 29, 2007, the six months ended December 30, 2006 and the year ended July 1, 2006. The
Company recognized derivative losses related to derivative instruments to which hedge accounting
was not applied of $6,691, $451, $0 and $0 for the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29,
2007, the six months ended December 30, 2006 and the year ended July 1, 2006, respectively.

(e)  Fair Values

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, notes
receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt approximated fair value as of January 3, 2009 and
December 29, 2007. The fair value of long-term debt was approximately $1,753,885 as of January 3,
2009 and had a carrying value of $2,176,547; the fair value of
long-term debt at December 29, 2007 approximated the carrying value
as of that date. The fair value was determined
using market quotes. The carrying amounts of the Company’s notes payable approximated fair value as
of January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, primarily due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. The fair values of the remaining financial instruments recognized in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets of the Company at the respective year ends were:

and year ended July 1, 2006

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

The fair value of the swaps is determined based upon externally developed pricing models,
using financial market data obtained from swap dealers. The fair value of the forwards and options
is based upon quoted market prices obtained from third-party institutions.

(f) Concentration of Credit Risk

Trade accounts receivable due from customers that the Company considers highly leveraged were
$124,281 at January 3, 2009, $115,233 at December 29, 2007, $107,783 at December 30, 2006 and
$121,870 at July 1, 2006. The financial position of these businesses has been considered in
determining allowances for doubtful accounts.

See Note 21 for disclosure of significant customer concentrations by segment.

(15) Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities

The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 as of December 30, 2007 for its financial
assets and liabilities. Although having partially adopted SFAS 157 has had no material impact on
its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company is now required to
provide additional disclosures as part of its financial statements. SFAS 157 clarifies that fair
value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability. SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs
such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in
active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as
unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to
develop its own assumptions.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of three valuation
techniques noted in SFAS 157. The three valuation techniques are as follows:

•

Market approach — prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

•

Cost approach — amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an
asset or replacement cost.

•

Income approach — techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based
on market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing and other
models.

The Company primarily applies the market approach for commodity derivatives and the income
approach for interest rate and foreign currency derivatives for recurring fair value measurements
and attempts to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

As of January 3, 2009, the Company held certain financial assets and liabilities that are
required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These consisted of the Company’s
derivative instruments related to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The fair values of
cotton derivatives are determined based on quoted prices in public markets and are categorized as
Level 1, however, the Company did not have any outstanding cotton derivatives outstanding at
January 3, 2009. The fair values of interest rate and foreign exchange rate derivatives are
determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from
information available in publicly quoted markets and are categorized as Level 2. The Company does
not have any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
categorized as Level 3, and there were no transfers in or out of Level 3 during the year ended
January 3, 2009. There were no changes during year ended January 3, 2009 to the Company’s valuation
techniques used to measure asset and liability fair values on a recurring basis.

The following table sets forth by level within SFAS 157’s fair value hierarchy the Company’s
financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis January 3, 2009.
As required by SFAS 157, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment
of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may
affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value
hierarchy levels.

The determination of fair values above incorporates various factors required under SFAS 157.
These factors include not only the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of
credit enhancements, but also the impact of the Company’s nonperformance risk on its liabilities.

(16) Defined Benefit Pension Plans

During the year ended December 29, 2007, the Company completed the separation of its pension
plan assets and liabilities from those of Sara Lee in accordance with governmental regulations,
which resulted in a higher total amount of pension plan assets being transferred to the Company
than originally was estimated prior to the spin off. Prior to spin off, the fair value of plan
assets included in the annual valuations represented a best estimate based upon a percentage
allocation of total assets of the Sara Lee trust. The separation resulted in a reduction to pension
liabilities of approximately $74,000 with a corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital and
resulted in a decrease of approximately $6,000 to pension expense for the year ended December 29,
2007.

Effective as of January 1, 2006, the Company created the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension and
Retirement Plan (the “Hanesbrands Pension Plan”), a new frozen defined benefit plan to receive
assets and liabilities accrued under the Sara Lee Pension Plan that are attributable to current and
former Company employees. In connection with the spin off on September 5, 2006, the Company assumed
Sara Lee’s obligations under the Sara Lee Corporation Consolidated Pension and Retirement Plan, the
Sara Lee Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, the Sara Lee Canada Pension Plans and certain
other plans that related to the Company’s current and former employees and assumed other Sara Lee
retirement plans covering only Company employees. Prior to the spin off the obligations were not
included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also assumed two
noncontributory defined benefit plans, the Playtex Apparel, Inc. Pension Plan (the “Playtex Plan”)
and the National Textiles, L.L.C. Pension Plan (the “National Textiles Plan”). The obligations and
costs related to all of these plans are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements
as of January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007.

On September 29, 2006, SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans” was issued. The objectives of SFAS 158 are for an employer to a)
recognize the overfunded status of a plan as an asset and the underfunded status of a plan as a
liability in the balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status in comprehensive
income or loss, and b) measure the funded status of a plan as of the
date of its balance sheet date. Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible
assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard. SFAS 158 requires initial
application of the requirement to

Prior to the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006, employees who met certain
eligibility requirements participated in defined benefit pension plans sponsored by Sara Lee. These
defined benefit pension plans included employees from a number of domestic Sara Lee business units.
All obligations pursuant to these plans have historically been obligations of Sara Lee and as such,
were not included on the Company’s historical Consolidated Balance Sheets, prior to September 5,
2006. The annual cost of the Sara Lee defined benefit plans was allocated to all of the
participating businesses based upon a specific actuarial computation which was followed
consistently.

The annual (income) cost incurred by the Company for these defined benefit plans is as

(a) Measurement Date and Assumptions

In accordance with the adoption of SFAS 158 part (b), a year end measurement date was used to
value plan assets and obligations for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans for the years
ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007. The impact of adopting part (b) is an adjustment of
$1,058 to increase retained earnings, with offsetting decreases to pension liability of $1,804 and
accumulated other comprehensive income of $747 for the year ended December 29, 2007. A measurement
date of September 30 was used for the six months ended December 30, 2006, and a March 31
measurement date for all previous periods. The weighted average actuarial assumptions used in
measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obligations for the periods presented were as
follows:

January 3,

The compensation increase assumption applies to the non domestic plans and portions of the

January 3, 2009, December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006, and July 1, 2006.

(b) Plan Assets, Expected Benefit Payments, and Funding

The allocation of pension plan assets as of the respective period end measurement dates is as
follows:

Asset category:

The investment objectives for the pension plan assets are designed to generate returns that
will enable the pension plans to meet their future obligations. The asset target allocations
approximate the actual asset allocations noted above.

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

Due to the current funded status of the plans, the Company is not required to make any
mandatory contributions to the pension plans in 2009. Expected benefit payments are as follows:
$59,354 in 2009, $50,732 in 2010, $49,397 in 2011, $48,648 in 2012, $48,757 in 2013 and $261,190
thereafter.

(17) Postretirement Healthcare and Life Insurance Plans

On December 1, 2007 the Company effectively terminated all retiree medical coverage.
Postretirement benefit income of $28,467 was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income for
the six months ended December 30, 2006, which represented the unrecognized amounts associated with
prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining service period of
the participants prior to the December 2006 amendments. A gain on curtailment of $32,144 is
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 29, 2007, which
represents the final settlement of the retirement plan.

In December 2006, the Company changed the postretirement plan benefits to (a) pass along a
higher share of retiree medical costs to all retirees effective February 1, 2007, (b) eliminate
company contributions toward premiums for retiree medical coverage effective December 1, 2007,
(c) eliminate retiree medical coverage options for all current and future retirees age 65 and older
and (d) eliminate future postretirement life benefits. Gains associated with these plan amendments
were amortized throughout the year ended December 29, 2007 in anticipation of the effective
termination of the medical plan on December 1, 2007.

On September 29, 2006, SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans” was issued. The objectives of SFAS 158 are for an employer to
a) recognize the overfunded status of a plan as an asset and the underfunded status of a plan as a
liability in the balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status in comprehensive
income or loss, and b) measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its balance sheet
date. Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are also derecognized
upon adoption of the new standard. SFAS 158 requires initial application of the requirement to
recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the related disclosure provisions as of the end
of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. SFAS 158 requires initial application of the
requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date as of the
end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted part (a) of the statement
as of December 30, 2006. The Company adopted part (b) of the statement as of December 29, 2007. The
following table summarizes the effect of the adoption of part (a) of SFAS 158 on the December 30,

Prior to the spin off from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006, employees who met certain
eligibility requirements participated in postretirement healthcare and life insurance sponsored by
Sara Lee. These plans included employees from a number of domestic Sara Lee business units. All
obligations pursuant to these plans have historically been obligations of Sara Lee and as such,
were not included on the Company’s historical Consolidated Balance Sheets, prior to September 5,

participating businesses based upon a specific actuarial computation which was followed
consistently. In connection with the spin off on September 5, 2006, the Company assumed Sara Lee’s
obligations under the Sara Lee postretirement plans related to the Company’s current and former
employees.

The postretirement plan expense incurred by the Company for these postretirement plans is as

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007
was $23,727 and $15,992, respectively. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the
years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 was $7,735 and $1,401, respectively.

The valuation allowance relates in part to deferred tax assets established under SFAS No. 109
for foreign loss carryforwards at January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007 was $21,527 and $13,137,
and to foreign goodwill of $2,200 at January 3, 2009 and $2,855 and December 29, 2007.

The Company and Sara Lee entered into a tax sharing agreement in connection with the spin off
of the Company from Sara Lee on September 5, 2006. Under the tax sharing agreement, within
180 days after Sara Lee filed its final consolidated tax return for the period that included
September 5, 2006, Sara Lee was required to deliver to the Company a computation of the amount of
deferred taxes attributable to the Company’s United States and Canadian operations that would be
included on the Company’s opening balance sheet as of September 6, 2006 (“as finally determined”)
which has been done. The Company has the right to participate in the computation of the amount of
deferred taxes. Under the tax sharing agreement, if substituting the amount of deferred taxes as
finally determined for the amount of estimated deferred taxes that were included on that balance
sheet at the time of the spin off causes a decrease in the net book value reflected on that balance
sheet, then Sara Lee will be required to pay the Company the amount of such decrease. If such
substitution causes an increase in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet, then the
Company will be required to pay Sara Lee the amount of such increase. For purposes of this
computation, the Company’s deferred taxes are the amount of deferred tax benefits (including
deferred tax
consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards) that would be
recognized as assets on the Company’s balance sheet computed in accordance with GAAP, but without
regard to valuation allowances, less the amount of deferred tax liabilities (including deferred tax
consequences attributable to taxable temporary differences) that would be recognized as liabilities
on the Company’s opening balance sheet computed in accordance with GAAP, but without regard to
valuation allowances. Neither the Company nor Sara Lee will be required to make any other payments
to the other with respect to deferred taxes.

The amount that is expected to be collected from Sara Lee based on the Company’s computation

of January 3, 2009.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and
tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable
income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are
deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of
these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.

At January 3, 2009, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $83,580
which will expire as follows:

At January 3, 2009, applicable U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have
not been provided on the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be
permanently reinvested. If these earnings had not been permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of
approximately $119,000 would have been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted FIN 48 in the year ended December 29, 2007. As a
result of the
implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no adjustment in the liability for
unrecognized income tax benefits as of the beginning of 2007. Although it is not reasonably
possible to estimate the amount by which these unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease
within the next twelve months due to uncertainties regarding the timing of examinations and the
amount of settlements that may be paid, if any, to tax authorities, the Company does not expect
unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next twelve months. A reconciliation of
the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters
in income tax expense. The Company recognized $647 and $720 for interest and penalties classified
as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended January 3, 2009
and December 29, 2007, respectively. At January 3, 2009, the Company had a total of $1,367 of
interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits.

In addition, a $248,118 valuation allowance existed for capital losses resulting from the sale
of U.S. apparel capital assets in 2001 and 2003. Of these capital losses $224,969 expired unused at
July 1, 2006. During the six months ended December 30, 2006, deferred tax assets and the related
valuation allowance were reduced by $23,149 for the remaining capital losses and $9,387 in foreign
net operating losses retained by Sara Lee.

(19) Stockholders’ Equity

The Company is authorized to issue up to 500,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, and up to 50,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, and permits the
Company’s board of directors, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the aggregate
number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the Company
is authorized to issue. At January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, 93,520 and 95,232 shares,
respectively, of common stock were issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock were
issued or outstanding. Included within the 50,000 shares of preferred stock, 500 shares are
designated Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series A (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) and
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of rights under the rights agreement described below.

On February 1, 2007, the Company announced that the Board of Directors granted authority for
the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Share repurchases are made
periodically in open-market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements
and other factors. Additionally, management has been granted authority to establish a trading plan
under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act in connection with share repurchases, which will allow the
Company to repurchase shares in the open market during periods in which the stock trading window is
otherwise closed for our company and certain of the Company’s officers and employees pursuant to
the Company’s insider trading policy. During 2008, the Company purchased 1.2 million shares of
common stock at a cost of $30,275 (average price of $24.71). Since inception of the program, the
Company has
purchased 2.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $74,747 (average price of $26.33).
The primary objective of the share repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution caused by
the exercise of options and vesting of stock unit awards.

Preferred Stock Purchase Rights

Pursuant to a stockholder rights agreement entered into by the Company prior to the spin off,
one preferred stock purchase right will be distributed with and attached to each share of the
Company’s common stock. Each right will entitle its holder, under the circumstances described
below, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Series A Preferred Stock
at an exercise price of $75 per right. Initially, the rights will be associated with the Company’s
common stock, and will be transferable with and only with the transfer of the underlying share of
common stock. Until a right is exercised, its holder, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder
with respect to such rights, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive
dividends.

The rights will become exercisable and separately certificated only upon the rights
distribution date, which will occur upon the earlier of: (i) ten days following a public
announcement by the Company that a person or group (an “acquiring person”) has acquired, or
obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of its outstanding shares of
common stock (the date of the announcement being the “stock acquisition date”); or (ii) ten
business days (or later if so determined by our board of directors) following the commencement of
or public disclosure of an intention to commence a tender offer or exchange offer by a person if,
after acquiring the maximum number of securities sought pursuant to such offer, such person, or any
affiliate or associate of such person, would acquire, or obtain the right to acquire, beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.

Upon the Company’s public announcement that a person or group has become an acquiring person,
each holder of a right (other than any acquiring person and certain related parties, whose rights
will have automatically become null and void) will have the right to receive, upon exercise, common
stock with a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. In the event of certain
business combinations, each holder of a right (except rights which previously have been voided as
described above) will have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring
company having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right.

The Company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per right
(subject to adjustment and payable in cash, common stock or other consideration deemed appropriate
by the board of directors) at any time prior to the earlier of the stock acquisition date and the
rights expiration date. Immediately upon the action of the board of directors authorizing any
redemption, the rights will terminate and the holders of rights will only be entitled to receive
the redemption price. At any time after a person becomes an acquiring person and prior to the
earlier of (i) the time any person, together with all affiliates and associates, becomes the
beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock and (ii) the occurrence
of a business combination, the board of directors may cause the Company to exchange for all or part
of the then-outstanding and exercisable rights shares of its common stock at an exchange ratio of
one common share per right, adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar
transaction.

(20) Relationship with Sara Lee and Related Entities

Effective upon the completion of the spin off on September 5, 2006, Sara Lee ceased to be a
related party to the Company. Prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006, the Company participated
in a number of Sara Lee administered programs such as cash funding systems, insurance programs,
employee benefit programs and workers’ compensation programs. In connection with the spin off from
Sara Lee, the Company assumed $299,000 in unfunded employee benefit liabilities for pension,
postretirement and other retirement benefit qualified and
nonqualified plans, and $37,554 of liabilities in connection with property insurance, workers’
compensation, and other programs. The Company paid a dividend to Sara Lee of $1,950,000 and repaid
a loan in the amount of $450,000 during the six months ended December 30, 2006 which is reflected
in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity. An additional payment of approximately
$26,306 was paid to Sara Lee during the six months ended December 30, 2006 in order to satisfy all
outstanding payables from the Company to Sara Lee and Sara Lee subsidiaries.

Statement of Income. For the years ended January 3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, the total amount
allocated for centralized administration costs by Sara Lee was $0.

In connection with the spin off, the Company entered into the following agreements with Sara
Lee:

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

(a) Allocation of Corporate Costs

Prior to the six months ended December 30, 2006, the costs of certain services that were
provided by Sara Lee to the Company were reflected in the Company’s financial statements. Beginning
with the six months ended December 30, 2006, there were no costs allocated as the Company’s
infrastructure was in place and did not significantly benefit from these services from Sara Lee.
The costs reflected in the financial statements for periods prior to the six months ended December
30, 2006 included charges for services such as business insurance, medical insurance and employee
benefit plans and allocations for certain centralized administration costs for treasury, real
estate, accounting, auditing, tax, risk management, human resources and benefits administration.
These allocations of centralized administration costs were determined using a proportional cost
allocation method on bases that the Company and Sara Lee considered to be reasonable, including
relevant operating profit, fixed assets, sales, and payroll. Allocated costs are included in the
“Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
total amount allocated for centralized administration costs by Sara Lee in the years ended January
3, 2009 and December 29, 2007, the six months ended December 30, 2006 and the year ended July 1,
2006 was $0, $0, $0, and $37,478, respectively. These costs represent management’s reasonable
allocation of the costs incurred. However, these amounts may not be representative of the costs
necessary for the Company to operate as a separate stand alone company. The “Net transactions with
parent companies” line item in the Consolidated Statements of Parent Companies’ Equity primarily
reflects dividends paid to parent companies and costs paid by Sara Lee on behalf of the Company.

(b) Other Transactions with Sara Lee Related Entities

During all periods presented prior to the spin off on September 5, 2006, the Company’s
entities engaged in certain transactions with other Sara Lee businesses that are not part of the
Company, which included the purchase and sale of certain inventory, the exchange of services, and
royalty arrangements involving the use of trademarks or other intangibles.

Transactions with related entities are summarized in the table below:

(21) Business Segment Information

The Company’s operations are managed and reported in five operating segments, each of which is
a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Outerwear, International, Hosiery
and Other. These segments are organized principally by product category and geographic location.
Management of each segment is responsible for the operations of these businesses but share a common
supply chain and media and marketing platforms.

The types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are
as follows:

The amounts above include the impact of restructuring and curtailment as described in Notes 5
and 17, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the fourth quarter of the year
ended January 3, 2009, the Company recognized a one-time out of period adjustment to increase gross
profit approximately $8,000 related to the capitalization of certain inventory supplies to be on a
consistent basis across all business lines. The inconsistent application of the policy was not
material to prior years or quarterly periods.

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

(24) Consolidating Financial Information

In accordance with the indenture governing the Company’s $500,000 Floating Rate Senior Notes
issued on December 14, 2006, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have guaranteed the Company’s
obligations under the Floating Rate Senior Notes. The following presents the condensed
consolidating financial information separately for:

(i) Parent Company, the issuer of the guaranteed obligations. Parent Company includes
Hanesbrands Inc. and its 100% owned operating divisions which are not legal entities, and
excludes its subsidiaries which are legal entities;

(ii) For the period prior to the spin off from Sara Lee, divisional entities, on a combined
basis, representing operating divisions (not legal entities) 100% owned by Sara Lee Corporation
(former parent company);

(iii) Guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, as specified in the indenture governing
the Floating Rate Senior Notes;

(iv) Non-guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis;

(v) Consolidating entries and eliminations representing adjustments to (a) eliminate
intercompany transactions between or among Parent Company, the guarantor subsidiaries and the
non-guarantor subsidiaries, (b) eliminate intercompany profit in inventory, (c) eliminate the
investments in our subsidiaries and (d) record consolidating entries; and

(vi) Parent Company, on a consolidated basis.

As described in Note 1, a separate legal entity did not exist for Hanesbrands Inc. prior to
the spin off from Sara Lee because a direct ownership relationship did not exist among the various
units comprising the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia Business. In connection with the spin off
from Sara Lee, each guarantor subsidiary became a 100% owned direct or indirect subsidiary of
Hanesbrands Inc. as of September 5, 2006. Therefore, a parent company entity is not presented for
periods prior to the spin off, but divisional entities of Sara Lee are presented.

The Floating Rate Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several
basis by each guarantor subsidiary, each of which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by
Hanesbrands Inc. Each entity in the consolidating financial information follows the same accounting
policies as described in the consolidated financial statements, except for the use by the Parent
Company and guarantor subsidiaries of the equity method of accounting to reflect ownership
interests in subsidiaries which are eliminated upon consolidation.

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation and legal entity structure relating to the classification of the investment in
subsidiary balances and related equity in earnings of subsidiaries. Prior period presentation has
been revised to combine Parent and Divisional Entities columns for periods after the spin off from
Sara Lee on September 5, 2006.
