PART I

Item 1.

Business

Company Overview

Hanesbrands Inc., a Maryland corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, “Hanesbrands,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”), is a socially responsible manufacturer and marketer of leading everyday basic apparel under some of the world’s strongest apparel brands, including

Hanes, Champion, Maidenform, DIM, Playtex, Bali, JMS/Just My Size, Nur Die/Nur Der, L’eggs, Lovable, Wonderbra, Flexees, Lilyette

and

Gear for Sports.

We sell bras, panties, shapewear, hosiery, men’s underwear, children’s underwear, socks, T-shirts and other activewear in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe. In the United States, we sell more units of intimate apparel, male underwear and children’s underwear than any other company. Unlike most apparel companies, Hanesbrands primarily operates its own manufacturing facilities. More than 80 percent of the apparel units that we sell in the United States are manufactured in our own plants or those of dedicated contractors.

We have a long history of innovation, product excellence and brand recognition. In fact, more than 80 percent of U.S. households have our products in them. We revolutionized Tagless T-shirts and underwear, we invented the sports bra, we were the first to advertise a bra on national television (

Playtex

). We are now using our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy to integrate our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost global supply chain to provide higher valued products while lowering production costs. Our Tagless apparel platform, ComfortFlex Fit bra platform, ComfortBlend fabric platform and temperature-control X-Temp fabric platform incorporate big-idea innovation to span brands, product categories, business segments, retailer and distribution channels and geographies.

Founded in 1901, we were organized as a Maryland corporation in 2005 and spun off from Sara Lee Corporation in 2006, at which time we became an independent, publicly-traded corporation. Since then, we have used strategic acquisitions to expand our brand portfolio. In November 2010, we expanded our activewear portfolio through the acquisition of GearCo, Inc., known as

Gear for Sports

, a leading seller of licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores and other channels. In October 2013, we acquired Maidenform Brands Inc., a global intimate apparel company, including the brands

Maidenform

,

Flexees

and

Lilyette

. We acquired another portfolio of strong brands including

DIM

,

Nur Die/Nur Der

,

Lovable

,

Shock Absorber

and

Abanderado

through the August 2014 acquisition of DBA Lux Holding S.A. (“Hanes Europe Innerwear”), a leading marketer of intimate apparel, hosiery and underwear in Europe. Most recently, in April 2015, we acquired Knights Holdco, Inc. (“Knights Apparel”), a leading seller of licensed collegiate logo apparel primarily in the mass retail channel. We believe these acquisitions will create growth and cost savings opportunities and increased scale to serve retailers.

We take great pride in our strong reputation for ethical business practices and the success of our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility program for community and environmental improvement. Hanesbrands was a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award winner for 2012-2015 and Partner of the Year winner in 2010 and 2011. We have significant goals for reducing our energy use, carbon emissions and water use and publicly report our progress. We are also a recognized leader for our community-building, philanthropy and workplace practices. More information about our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility initiatives may be found at

www.HanesForGood.com

.

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. All references to “


”, “


” and “


” relate to the 52 week fiscal year ended on

January 2, 2016

, the 53 week fiscal year ended on

January 3, 2015

, and the 52 week fiscal year ended on

December 28, 2013

, respectively. A significant subsidiary of ours, DBA Lux Holding S.A. (“Hanes Europe Innerwear”), had a 53 week fiscal year ended on January 2, 2016 as a result of aligning Hanes Europe Innerwear’s year end with ours in the year after acquisition. The difference in reporting one additional week of financial information for Hanes Europe Innerwear did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our portfolio of leading brands is designed to address the needs and wants of various consumer segments across a broad range of basic apparel products. Our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S. market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete.

23%

,

15%

and

5%

, respectively, of our total net sales in 2015. As is common in the basic apparel industry, we generally do not have purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products. However, all of our key customer relationships have been in place for 10 years or more. Wal-Mart and Target are our only customers with sales that exceed 10% of any individual segment’s sales.

Penney Company, Inc. and Sears Holdings Corporation. We sell all of our product categories in this channel. Traditional department stores target higher-income consumers and carry more high-end, fashion conscious products than mid-tier stores or

Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution

During


, approximately 65% of our cost of sales were from finished goods manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and operated by third party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for us, such as cutting and/or sewing. We sourced the remainder of our finished goods from third party manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our designs. In making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and third party sources of supply, we consider a number of factors, including labor, local operating costs, quality, regional infrastructure, applicable quotas and duties and freight costs. We believe that our balanced approach to product supply, which relies on a combination of owned, contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions, increases the efficiency of our operations, reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply.

Finished Goods That Are Manufactured by Hanesbrands

The manufacturing process for the finished goods that we manufacture begins with raw materials we obtain from suppliers. The principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and synthetics. Cotton and synthetic materials are typically spun into yarn, which is then knitted into cotton, synthetic and blended fabrics. We source all of our yarn requirements from large-scale domestic and international suppliers. To a lesser extent, we purchase fabric from several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production. In addition to cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles, we use thread, narrow elastic and trim for product identification, buttons, zippers, snaps and lace. These fabrics are cut and sewn into finished products, either by us or by third party contractors. We currently operate 47 manufacturing facilities. Most of our cutting and sewing operations are strategically located in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. Alternate sources of these materials and services are readily available.

Finished Goods That Are Manufactured by Third Parties

In addition to our manufacturing capabilities, we also source finished goods we design from third-party manufacturers, also referred to as “turnkey products.” Many of these turnkey products are sourced from international suppliers by our strategic sourcing hubs in Asia.

All contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high quality standards. Further, all contractors and third-party manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict supplier and business practices guidelines. These requirements provide strict standards that, among other things, cover hours of work, age of workers, health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws and Hanesbrands’ standards. Each new supplier must be inspected and agree to comprehensive



compliance terms prior to performance of any production on our behalf. We audit compliance with these standards and maintain strict compliance performance records. In addition to our audit procedures, many of our suppliers are certified by the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production, or “WRAP,” program. WRAP uses third-party, independent audit firms and requires factory-by-factory certification. We are also a fully accredited participating company in the Fair Labor Association.

Distribution

As of

January 2, 2016

, we distributed our products from 37 distribution centers. These facilities include 16 facilities located in the United States and 21 facilities located outside the United States in regions where we manufacture our products. We internally manage and operate 26 of these facilities, and we use third party logistics providers who operate the other 11 facilities on our behalf. International distribution operations use a combination of third party logistics providers, as well as owned and operated distribution operations, to distribute goods to our various international markets.

Inventory

Effective inventory management is a key component of our future success. Because our customers generally do not purchase our products under long-term supply contracts, but rather on a purchase order basis, effective inventory management requires close coordination with the customer base. We seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively managing inventory levels. We employ various types of inventory management techniques that include collaborative forecasting and planning, supplier-managed inventory, key event management and various forms of replenishment management processes. Our supplier-managed inventory initiative is intended to shift raw material ownership and management to our suppliers until consumption, freeing up cash and improving response time. We have demand management planners in our customer management group who work closely with customers to develop demand forecasts that are passed to the supply chain. We also have professionals within the customer management group who coordinate daily with our larger customers to help ensure that our customers’ planned inventory levels are in fact available at their individual retail outlets. Additionally, within our supply chain organization we have dedicated professionals who translate the demand forecast into our inventory strategy and specific production plans. These individuals work closely with our customer management team to balance inventory investment/exposure with customer service targets.

Seasonality and Other Factors

Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. For instance, we generally have higher sales during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather, which benefits certain product categories such as fleece. Our diverse range of product offerings, however, provides some mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers’ decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us. Media, advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions.

Product Innovation and Marketing

A significant component of our margin-enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our strong product research and development and innovation capabilities. From 2013 to 2015, we spent nearly $177 million on design, research and product development, including the development of new and improved products.

We use a disciplined, consumer-driven approach to direct our product innovation and marketing efforts. We seek to identify relevant consumer insights and long-term megatrends that will impact our product categories over the next five to 10 years. We focus our innovation efforts on big-idea platforms that span brands, product categories, business segments, distribution channels and geographies. In addition, we concentrate on margin accretive product innovations where we can leverage our supply chain in order to drive further economies of scale. Examples of our product innovation platforms include:

•

Tagless: Over a decade ago, we launched

Hanes

Tagless Tees that deliver superior softness without the itch and irritation of a tag. In 2012, our consumer-driven innovation process led us to expand this platform to the male underwear bottom category where research indicated that itchy tags were the number two consumer complaint. The Tagless platform also taps into the power of our supply chain, generating significant cost savings and allowing us to expand gross margins.

•

ComfortBlend: ComfortBlend, our fabric innovation that combines cotton and synthetic yarns for products that are softer, shrink less and dry faster, is an outgrowth of the performance fabric megatrend. In developing ComfortBlend, we worked through each step of the big idea process, testing the concept, the product and the advertising. We



introduced

Hanes

men’s ComfortBlend underwear in 2012 with exceptional results and have now expanded this platform to socks, children’s underwear and panties.

•

ComfortFlex Fit: Our ComfortFlex Fit platform is another example of our consumer-driven innovation process, where research indicated the two most significant consumer complaints in the bra category were that the consumer could not find the right size and that the consumer could not find a comfortable bra. ComfortFlex Fit effectively addresses both concerns by combining a simplified shopping system that eliminates the complicated cup-and-band combinations of traditional bra sizing systems with a more comfortable, flexible fit. We have successfully leveraged the ComfortFlex Fit platform across our

Hanes

,

Champion, Playtex

,

Bali

, and

JMS

/

Just My Size

brands where it is driving incremental purchases in a category where consumers typically buy only a little over three bras per year.

•

X-Temp: X-Temp is our newest platform and brings a new level of technology and comfort to basic apparel.

Hanes

and

Champion

X-Temp garments are designed to keep consumers cooler and drier by increasing the rate of evaporation when body temperature rises and reducing the rate of evaporation as body temperature cools. The X-Temp platform was successfully introduced in

Hanes

men’s underwear and men’s socks in 2013 and expanded to women’s socks, panties, bras, legwear, base layer and children’s underwear and socks in 2014.

Champion

Vapor with X-Temp technology was introduced in men’s and women’s activewear in 2013 and expanded to team practicewear and branded printwear in 2014.

Driving innovation platforms across categories is a major element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy as it enables us to meet key consumer needs and leverage advertising dollars. We believe that the strength of our consumer insights, our distinctive brand propositions and our focus on integrated marketing give us a competitive advantage in the fragmented apparel marketplace. Effectively marketing these innovations also accrues benefits back to our supply chain. Driving higher volume helps us to leverage scale and drive costs down even further, increasing margins while funding additional marketing support for our brands and products so we can continue to reinvest in product innovation.

In 2015, our broad-reach marketing efforts included:

•

National advertising for our flagship

Hanes

brand starring Michael Jordan highlighting our

Hanes

Tagless tees and underwear;

•

A cross-category, multi-media

Hanes

advertising campaign designed to build awareness of our revolutionary X-Temp cooling technology;

•

Television and social media advertising featuring our ComfortFlex Fit bras by

Hanes

and

Bali

; and

•

Continued advertising support for our

Champion

brand, highlighting the new Absolute Sports Bra with SmoothTec band and our

Champion

Vapor fast-dying performance apparel.

Competition

The basic apparel market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Competition generally is based upon brand, comfort, fit, style and price. Our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers. Fruit of the Loom, Inc., a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., competes with us across most of our segments through its own offerings and those of its Russell Corporation and Vanity Fair Intimates offerings. Other competitors in our Innerwear segment include Limited Brands, Inc.’s Victoria’s Secret brand and Jockey International, Inc. Other competitors in our Activewear segment include various private label and controlled brands sold by many of our customers, as well as Gildan Activewear, Inc. and Gap Inc. Large European intimate apparel distributors such as Triumph International and Calzedonia S.p.A Group compete with us in our International segment. We also compete with many small manufacturers across all of our business segments, including our International segment. Additionally, department stores and other retailers, including many of our customers, market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands. Our competitive strengths include our strong brands with leading market positions, our high-volume, core products focus, our significant scale of operations, our global supply chain and our strong customer relationships. We continually strive to improve in each of these areas.

. Some of our products are sold under trademarks that have been licensed from third parties, such as Polo Ralph Lauren men’s underwear and Donna Karan and DKNY intimate apparel.



Some of our own trademarks are licensed to third parties, such as

Champion

for athletic-oriented accessories. In the United States and Canada, the

Playtex

trademark is owned by Playtex Marketing Corporation, of which we own a 50% interest and which grants to us a perpetual royalty-free license to the

Playtex

trademark on and in connection with the sale of apparel in the United States and Canada. The other 50% interest in Playtex Marketing Corporation is owned by Playtex Products, LLC, an unrelated third party, whose affiliate, Edgewell Personal Care Brands, LLC, has a perpetual royalty-free license to the

Playtex

trademark on and in connection with the sale of non-apparel products in the United States and Canada. Outside the United States and Canada, we own the

Playtex

trademark and perpetually license such trademark to Edgewell Personal Care Brands, LLC for non-apparel products. Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value. We aggressively protect these trademarks from infringement and dilution through appropriate measures, including court actions and administrative proceedings.

Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally remain valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Most of the trademarks in our portfolio, including our core brands, are covered by trademark registrations in the countries of the world in which we do business, in addition to many other jurisdictions around the world, with a registration period of 10 years in most countries. Generally, trademark registrations can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We have an active program designed to ensure that our trademarks are registered, renewed, protected and maintained. We plan to continue to use all of our core trademarks and plan to renew the registrations for such trademarks as needed. We also own a number of copyrights.

Most of our copyrights are unregistered, although we have a sizable portfolio of copyrighted lace designs that are the subject of a number of registrations at the U.S. Copyright Office.

We place high importance on product innovation and design, and a number of these innovations and designs are the subject of patents. However, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we own proprietary trade secrets, technology and know-how that we have not patented.

Geographic Financial Summary

For a summary of our operations by geographic area for each of the three most recent fiscal years, including revenues from external customers and long-lived assets, see Note, “Geographic Area Information,” to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters

We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that could affect our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and various environmental laws and regulations. Some of our international businesses are subject to similar laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate. Our operations also are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, current governmental regulations may change or become more stringent or unforeseen events may occur, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern our activities, operations and products that may have adverse environmental and health and safety effects, including laws and regulations relating to generating emissions, water discharges, waste, product and packaging content and workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions. We are aware of hazardous substances or petroleum releases at certain of our facilities and are working with the relevant environmental authorities to investigate and address such releases. We also have been identified as a “potentially responsible party” at certain waste disposal sites undergoing investigation and cleanup under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as Superfund) or state Superfund equivalent programs. Where we have determined that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated, we have accrued amounts in our balance sheet for losses related to these sites. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our remedial environmental obligations historically have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any proposed regulations or remedial obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital expenditures in connection with such compliance.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Hanesbrands conducts business around the world in a highly ethical manner. We are protective of our strong reputation for corporate citizenship and social responsibility and proud of our significant achievements in the areas of environmental stewardship, workplace quality and community building.



We call our corporate social responsibility program “Hanes for Good” because adhering to responsible and sustainable business practices is good for our company, good for our employees, good for our communities and good for our investors. We own the majority of our supply chain and have more direct control over how we do business than many of our competitors. In fact, more than 80% of the apparel we sell in the United States is produced in facilities that we operate or control. We also have an industry-leading compliance program that helps to ensure our business partners live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves.

We have been recognized for our socially responsible business practices by such organizations as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star program, corporate responsibility advocate As You Sow, social compliance rating group Free2Work, the United Way and others. We are members of the Fair Labor Association, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, The Sustainability Consortium and Corporate Eco Forum.

We have made significant progress across a range of corporate social responsibility issues, but we recognize that there is always room for improvement. We pride ourselves on listening to others outside our company and reacting quickly and responsibly if issues emerge. We hope to continue making a positive and lasting contribution to our world in the years to come. More information about our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility initiatives may be found at

Employees

As of January 2, 2016, we had approximately 65,300 employees, approximately 7,700 of whom were located in the United States. As of January 2, 2016, approximately 30 employees in the United States were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A significant portion of our employees based in foreign countries are represented by works councils or unions or subject to trade-sponsored or governmental agreements. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

This section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change, for the worse, existing trends in our businesses. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our businesses and operations.

Our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses could impact our financial results.

As a leading branded apparel company, we expect to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions as part of our long-term business strategy, such as our recent acquisition of Knights Apparel. Difficulties may arise in the integration of the business and operations of businesses that we acquire and, as a result, we may not be able to achieve the cost savings and synergies that we expect will result from such transactions. Achieving cost savings is dependent on consolidating certain operational and functional areas, eliminating duplicative positions and terminating certain agreements for outside services. Additional operational savings are dependent upon the conversion of core operating systems, data systems and products and the standardization of business practices. Complications or difficulties in the conversion of core operating systems, data systems and products may result in the loss of customers, operational problems, one-time costs currently not anticipated or reduced cost savings resulting from such acquisitions. Annual cost savings in each such transaction may be materially less than anticipated if the closing of the acquisition is delayed unexpectedly, the integration of operations is delayed beyond what is anticipated or the conversion to a single set of data systems is not accomplished on a timely basis.

Acquired businesses may not achieve expected results of operations, including expected levels of revenues, and may require unanticipated costs and expenditures. In addition, following completion of an acquisition, we may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we and the acquired business have achieved or might achieve separately. Acquired businesses may also subject us to liabilities that we were unable to discover in the course of our due diligence, and our rights to indemnification from the sellers of such other businesses, even if obtained, may not be sufficient to offset the relevant liabilities. In addition, the integration of newly acquired businesses may be expensive and time-consuming and may not be entirely successful. Integration of the acquired businesses may also place additional pressures on our systems of internal control over financial reporting. The process of integrating the operations of acquired businesses could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel. If we are unable to successfully integrate any newly acquired business or if the acquired businesses fail to produce targeted results, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.



Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure with respect to our information technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.

Our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively and support global growth and expansion, problems with integrating various data sources, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses, or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business.

Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers’ or employees’ personal information, or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits.

Moreover, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data. Any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility, and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.

Significant fluctuations and volatility in the price of various input costs, such as cotton and oil-related materials, utilities, freight and wages, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as dyes and chemicals, and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Similarly, a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. Sudden decreases in the costs for materials, including cotton, may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production, which could result in lower profitability, particularly if these decreases result in downward price pressure. If, in the future we incur volatility in the costs for materials, including cotton, and labor that we are unable to offset through price adjustments or improved efficiencies, or if our competitors’ unwillingness to follow our price changes results in downward price pressure, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.

Our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory effectively and accurately forecast demand for our products.

We are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our inventory with our ability to meet marketplace needs. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to translate these preferences and trends into marketable product offerings, as well as unanticipated changes in general economic conditions or other factors, which result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers.

Inventory reserves can result from the complexity of our supply chain, a long manufacturing process and the seasonal nature of certain products. We sell a large number of our products to a small number of customers, and these customers generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods. As a result, we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with third-party manufacturers before our customers’ orders are firm. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to our reputation and relationships. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, sudden decreases in the costs for materials, including cotton, may result in the cost of inventory exceeding the cost of new production; if this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow, particularly if we hold a large amount of excess inventory. Excess inventory charges can reduce gross margins or result in operating losses, lowered plant and equipment utilization and lowered fixed operating cost absorption, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.



We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively in the future.

The basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly. Competition is generally based upon brand, comfort, fit, style and price. Our businesses face competition today from other large domestic and foreign corporations and manufacturers, as well as department stores and other retailers, including many of our customers, that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands. Also, online retail shopping is rapidly evolving, and we expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. Increased competition may result in a loss of or a reduction in shelf space and promotional support and reduced prices, in each case decreasing our cash flows, operating margins and profitability. Our ability to identify and capitalize on retail trends, including technology, e-commerce and other process efficiencies to gain market share and better service our customer base will, in large part, determine our future success. If we fail to compete successfully, our market share, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.

Our business is subject to federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations, such as state and local wage and hour laws, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), securities laws, import and export laws (including customs regulations), unclaimed property laws and many others. We cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees, agents and business partners. Any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and, depending on the circumstances, subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, equitable remedies (including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct), securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the market value of our stock.

We have a complex multinational tax structure, and changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could impact our capital deployment strategy and adversely affect our results.

We have a complex multinational tax structure with multiple types of intercompany transactions, and our allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries through our intercompany transfer pricing agreements is subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. In order to service our debt obligations, we may need to increase the portion of the income our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the United States, which may significantly increase our income tax expense. In addition, we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns and related transfer pricing documentation by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, as well as our capital deployment strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Due to the extensive nature of our foreign operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations.

A growing percentage of our total revenues (approximately 20% in 2015) is derived from markets outside the United States. We sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars; however, we purchase many of our raw materials, pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies. As a result, when the U.S. dollar weakens against any of these currencies, our cost of sales could increase substantially. Outside the United States, we may pay for materials or finished products in U.S. dollars, and in some cases a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could effectively increase our costs where we use foreign currency to purchase the U.S. dollars we need to make such payments. Changes on foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. However, no hedging strategy can completely insulate us from foreign exchange risk. We are also exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our financial statements due to the translation of operating results and financial position of our foreign subsidiaries.



Inability to access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or commercially reasonable terms or maintain sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed could adversely impact our business.

We rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our Revolving Loan Facility and other external debt financings to meet the cash requirements of our business. We have significant capital requirements and will need continued access to debt capital from outside sources in order to efficiently fund the cash flow needs of our business and pursue strategic acquisitions.

Although we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt at a reasonable cost when necessary. The ability to have continued access to reasonably priced credit is dependent upon our current and future capital structure, financial performance, our credit ratings and general economic conditions. If we are unable to access the capital markets at a reasonable economic cost, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

We are subject to certain risks as a result of our indebtedness.

Our indebtedness includes (i) a $1.0 billion revolving loan facility (the “Revolving Loan Facility”), a $725 million term loan a facility (the “Term Loan A Facility”), a $425 million term loan b facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”) and a €363 million term loan b facility (the “Euro Term Loan Facility” and together with the Term Loan A Facility and the Term Loan B Facility, the “Term Loan Facility,” and together with the Revolving Loan Facility, the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”), (ii) our $1 billion 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “6.375% Senior Notes”) and (iii) a $275 million accounts receivable securitization facility (the “Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility”).

The Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indenture governing the 6.375% Senior Notes contain restrictions that affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to borrow funds, pay dividends or make other distributions, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, or create liens on our assets. Covenants in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to EBITDA (earnings before income taxes, depreciation expense and amortization), or leverage ratio. These restrictions and covenants could limit our ability to obtain additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions, meet our debt payment obligations and capital commitments, fund any operating losses or future development of our business affiliates, obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize our assets or conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities. Any failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions could result in an event of default that accelerates the maturity of our indebtedness under such facilities, resulting in an adverse effect on our business.

The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility have received a pledge of substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon exceptions for foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries. Additionally, these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our U.S. subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. The financial institutions that are party to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility have a lien on certain of our domestic accounts receivable. As a result of these pledges and liens, if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility or the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, the lenders under those facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and, at their option, liquidate these assets, which would adversely impact the operations of our business.

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability.

We have a complex global supply chain and distribution network that supports our ability consistently to provide our products to our customers. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, tsunami, terrorist attack, pandemic or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the safety and availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other systems and operations. While our operational size, the diversity of locations from which we operate, and our redundant back-up systems provide us with a strong advantage should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, we could still experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel in our technology group. If we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, production or supply systems, we may be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers. These events could result in reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive markdowns. All of the foregoing can have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.



Our operations in international markets, and our earnings in those markets, may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.

During 2015, net sales from our International segment were $1.1 billion, representing approximately 20% of total net sales. In addition, a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located, or our products are sourced from, outside the United States. As a result, our business is subject to risks associated with international operations. These risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations, unexpected changes in tariffs, taxes or regulatory requirements, and political unrest and corruption.

Regulatory changes could limit the countries in which we sell, produce or source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries. Restrictions imposed by such changes can have a particular impact on our business when, after we have moved our operations to a particular location, new unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable regulations currently in effect are changed.

Countries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time to time impose additional new regulations, or modify existing regulations, including:

•

changes in duties, taxes, tariffs and other charges on imports;

•

limitations on the quantity of goods which may be imported into the United States from a particular country;

•

requirements as to where products and/or inputs are manufactured or sourced;

•

creation of export licensing requirements, imposition of restrictions on export quantities or specification of minimum export pricing and/or export prices or duties;

•

limitations on foreign owned businesses; or

•

government actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets.

In addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the anti-corruption laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.

Economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers, suppliers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned, rather than on an impulse, basis, our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors that are outside of our control, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Reduced sales at our wholesale customers may lead to lower retail inventory levels, reduced orders to us or order cancellations. These lower sales volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets, may result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This may result in higher credit risk relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our suppliers of raw materials and finished goods, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and derivatives transactions. In addition, the inability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase. If third parties on which we rely for raw materials, finished goods or services are unable to overcome financial difficulties and provide us with the materials and services we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities or derivatives transactions do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.



We may be adversely affected by unseasonal or severe weather conditions.

Our business may be adversely affected by unseasonable or severe weather conditions. Periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter, or periods of unseasonably cool and wet weather in the spring or summer, can negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending.  In addition, severe weather events such as snow storms or hurricanes typically lead to temporarily reduced retail traffic.  Any of these conditions could result in negative point-of-sale trends for our merchandise and reduced replenishment shipments to our wholesale customers.

Our failure to properly manage strategic projects in order to achieve the desired results may negatively impact our business.

The implementation of our business strategy periodically involves the execution of complex projects, which places significant demands on our management, accounting, financial, information and other systems and on our business. Our ability to successfully implement such projects is dependent on management’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to our changing business needs. We cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage these projects effectively or implement them successfully. If we miscalculate the resources or time we need to complete a project or fail to implement the project effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

We rely on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In


, our top 10 customers accounted for 56% of our net sales and our top two customers, Wal-Mart and Target, accounted for

23%

and

15%

of our net sales, respectively. We expect that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales in the future. Moreover, our top customers are the largest market participants in our primary distribution channels across all of our product lines. We generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products, and as a result, most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis. A decision by any of our top customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from us could substantially reduce revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, if any of our customers devote less selling space to apparel products, our sales to those customers could be reduced even if we maintain our share of their apparel business. Any such reduction in apparel selling space could result in lower sales and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.

The loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials may interrupt our supplies and materially harm our business.

We purchase all of the raw materials used in our products and approximately 35% of the cost of sales derived from apparel designed by us from a limited number of third party suppliers and manufacturers. Our ability to meet our customers’ needs depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw materials and finished products from our third party suppliers and manufacturers. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our principal third party suppliers or manufacturers experience financial difficulties that they are not able to overcome resulting from worldwide economic conditions, production problems, difficulties in sourcing raw materials, lack of capacity or transportation disruptions, or if for these or other reasons they raise the prices of the raw materials or finished products we purchase from them. The magnitude of this risk depends upon the timing of any interruptions, the materials or products that the third party manufacturers provide and the volume of production.

Our dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished products subjects us to the risk of supplier failure and customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products. Quality failures by our third party manufacturers or changes in their financial or business condition that affect their production could disrupt our ability to supply quality products to our customers and thereby materially harm our business.

Our business depends on our senior management team and other key personnel.

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel, some of whom have unique talents and experience and would be difficult to replace. The loss or interruption of the services of a member of our senior management team or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business during the transitional period that would be required for a successor to assume the responsibilities of the position. Our future success will also depend on our ability to develop and/or recruit employees with the core competencies needed to support our growth in global markets and in new products or services. We may not be able to attract or retain these employees, which could adversely affect our business.



If we are unsuccessful in establishing effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, our sales could be negatively affected.

Inadequate or ineffective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales. Additionally, if our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition.

If we fail to maintain effective internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or timely or prevent or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or the market price of our securities.

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent or detect fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud, our brands and operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or the market price of our securities.

We may suffer negative publicity if we or our third party manufacturers violate labor laws or engage in practices that are viewed as unethical or illegal, which could cause a loss of business.

We cannot fully control the business and labor practices of our third party manufacturers, the majority of whom are located in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. If one of our own manufacturing operations or one of our third party manufacturers violates or is accused of violating local or international labor laws or other applicable regulations, or engages in labor or other practices that would be viewed in any market in which our products are sold as unethical, we could suffer negative publicity, which could tarnish our brands’ image or result in a loss of sales. In addition, if such negative publicity affected one of our customers, it could result in a loss of business for us.

Our existing customers may require products on an exclusive basis, forms of economic support and other changes that could be harmful to our business.

Customers increasingly may require us to provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis, which could cause an increase in the number of stock keeping units, or “SKUs,” we must carry and, consequently, increase our inventory levels and working capital requirements. Moreover, our customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support, which reduce our gross margins and affect our profitability. Our financial performance is negatively affected by these pricing pressures when we are forced to reduce our prices without being able to correspondingly reduce our production costs.

The success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation of our brands, including brands that we license to other parties. If other parties take actions that weaken, harm the reputation of or cause confusion with our brands, our business, and consequently our sales, results of operations and cash flows, may be adversely affected.

We license some of our important trademarks to third parties. For example, we license

Champion

to third parties for athletic-oriented accessories. Although we make concerted efforts to protect our brands through quality control mechanisms and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees, there is a risk that some licensees may not be in full compliance with those mechanisms and obligations. In that event, or if a licensee engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations.



We design, manufacture, source and sell products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties. If any licensor takes actions related to their trademarks that would cause their brands or our company reputational harm, our business may be adversely affected.

We design, manufacture, source and sell a number of our products under trademarks that are licensed from third parties, such as our Polo Ralph Lauren men’s underwear and our Donna Karan and DKNY intimate apparel. Because we do not control the brands licensed to us, our licensors could make changes to their brands or business models that could result in a significant downturn in a brand’s business, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. If any licensor engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that would cause us reputational harm, or if any of the brands licensed to us violates the trademark rights of another or are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely affecting our sales and results of operations, and we may be required to expend significant amounts on public relations, advertising and, possibly, legal fees.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely affected.

Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts and have substantial value. We aggressively protect these trademarks from infringement and dilution through appropriate measures, including court actions and administrative proceedings. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights. Infringement or counterfeiting of our products could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our business. Actions we have taken to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the United States or other countries, such as changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights, could have an impact on our ability to enforce those rights.

The value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in, or ownership of, our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks. We are from time to time involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to some items of our intellectual property.

Market returns could have a negative impact on the return on plan assets for our pension, which may require significant funding.

The plan assets of our pension plans, which had a loss of approximately 3% during


and a return of approximately 4% during


, are invested mainly in domestic and international equities, bonds and real estate. We are unable to predict the variations in asset values or the severity or duration of any disruptions in the financial markets or adverse economic conditions in the United States, Europe and Asia. The funded status of these plans, and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “Pension Protection Act”), losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements. Under the Pension Protection Act funding rules, our U.S. qualified pension plan is approximately 104% funded as of

January 2, 2016

. Any downward pressure on the asset values of these plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than we had originally planned, which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations.

Our balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge, which would be recorded as a noncash expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

Goodwill, trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. The fair value of the goodwill assigned to a business unit could decline if projected revenues or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to effects of the global economy or other causes. If the carrying value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the impairment loss recognized as a noncash charge in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

As of

January 2, 2016

, we had approximately

$834 million

of goodwill and

$701 million

of trademarks and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet, which together represent

27%

of our total assets. No impairment was identified in


. Changes in the future outlook of a business unit could result in an impairment loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.



Our balance sheet includes a significant amount of deferred tax assets. We must generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax benefits.

As of

January 2, 2016

, we had approximately $374 million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, which represents 7% of our total assets. Deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences (differences between the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the assets and liabilities in the calculation of taxable income). The recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax benefits will not be realized. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, which would cause an increase in our effective tax rate. A significant increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

We had approximately 65,300 employees worldwide as of

January 2, 2016

, and our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our employees or changes to U.S. or foreign employment regulations.

We had approximately 65,300 employees worldwide as of

January 2, 2016

. This means we have a significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our employees, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. Approximately 57,600 of those employees were outside of the United States. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have employees could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs, expend resources responding to such increases and lower our margins.

In addition, approximately 30 of our employees in the United States and a significant number of our international employees are members of labor organizations or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If there were a significant increase in the number of our employees who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we would become vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action by these employees that could have an adverse effect on our business.

Anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws, as well as Maryland law, may reduce the likelihood of any potential change of control or unsolicited acquisition proposal that you might consider favorable.

Our charter permits our Board of Directors, with the approval of a majority of the entire Board and without stockholder approval, to amend our charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have the authority to issue. In addition, our Board of Directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our Board of Directors could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Our charter also provides that a director may be removed at any time, but only for cause, as defined in our charter, and then only by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. We have also elected to be subject to certain provisions of Maryland law that provide that any and all vacancies on our Board of Directors may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our remaining directors, even if they do not constitute a quorum, and that any director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the directorship in which the vacancy occurred. Under Maryland law, our Board of Directors also is permitted, without stockholder approval, to implement a classified board structure at any time.

Our bylaws, which can only be amended by our Board of Directors, provide that nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of our bylaws. Also, under Maryland law, business combinations between us and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder, including mergers, consolidations, share exchanges or, in circumstances specified in the statute, asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. An interested stockholder includes any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our stock or any affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of our stock. A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if our Board of Directors approved in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, our Board of Directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of



approval, with any terms and conditions determined by our Board. After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between us and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by our Board of Directors and approved by two supermajority votes or our common stockholders must receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares. The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by our Board of Directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.

These and other provisions of Maryland law or our charter and bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be considered favorably by our stockholders.

Properties

We own and lease properties supporting our administrative, manufacturing, distribution and direct outlet activities. As of January 2, 2016, we owned and leased properties in 37 countries, including 47 manufacturing facilities and 37 distribution centers, as well as office facilities. The leases for these properties expire between 2016 and 2057, with the exception of some seasonal warehouses that we lease on a month-by-month basis. As of January 2, 2016, we also operated 252 direct outlet stores in the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and 144 retail and outlet stores internationally, most of which are leased under five-year, renewable lease agreements and several of which are leased under 10-year agreements. We believe that our facilities, as well as equipment, are in good condition and meet our current business needs.

We own our approximately 470,000 square-foot headquarters located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which houses our various sales, marketing and corporate business functions. Research and development as well as certain product-design functions also are located in Winston-Salem, while other design functions are located in a mix of leased and owned facilities in New York City and Lenexa, Kansas.

Our products are manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and operated by third party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for us, such as cutting and/or sewing. We source the remainder of our finished goods from third party manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our designs. Our most significant manufacturing facilities include an approximately 1.1 million square-foot owned facility located in San Juan Opico, El Salvador, an approximately 1.1 million square-foot owned facility located in Nanjing, China and an approximately 600,000 square-foot owned facility located in Bonao, Dominican Republic.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market for our Common Stock

Our common stock currently is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or the “NYSE,” under the symbol “HBI.” We have not made any unregistered sales of our equity securities.

The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices for our common stock as reported by the NYSE for each quarter during the last two fiscal years. All per share amounts and number of shares presented below reflect the four-for-one stock split that was effected in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

Holders of Record

On

February 2, 2016

, there were 22,091 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to determine the exact number of beneficial stockholders represented by these record holders, but we believe that there were approximately 110,464 beneficial owners of our common stock as of

February 2, 2016

.

Dividends

As part of our cash deployment strategy, in 2013, our Board of Directors declared our first dividends of $0.05 per share on outstanding common stock, which were paid in 2013. Prior to that declaration, we had not paid a cash dividend on our common stock.

In 2014, our Board of Directors authorized regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.075 per share, which were paid in 2014.

In January 2015, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend rate to $0.10 per share on outstanding common stock. During our 2015 fiscal year, regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share were paid on March 3, 2015, June 11, 2015, September 9, 2015 and December 8, 2015.

In January 2016, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend rate to $0.11 per share on outstanding common stock and declared a regular quarterly cash dividend to be paid on March 8, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2016.

In March 2015, we effected a four-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2015. All references to the number of common shares outstanding, per share amounts and share options data have been restated to reflect the effect of the split for all periods presented.

We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends on our outstanding common stock. However, there can be no assurance that future dividends will be declared and paid. The declaration and payment of future dividends, the amount of any such dividends, and the establishment of record and payment dates for dividends, if any, are subject to final determination by our Board of Directors after its review of general business conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our capital requirements, our prospects and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

We design, manufacture, source and sell a broad range of basic apparel such as T-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear, children’s underwear, activewear, socks and hosiery. Our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S. market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete.

Acquisitions

On April 6, 2015, we acquired Knights Apparel, a leading seller of licensed collegiate logo apparel primarily in the mass retail channel, from Merit Capital Partners. The acquisition was an all cash transaction valued at approximately

$193 million

on an enterprise value basis. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our Revolving Loan Facility. We believe the acquisition will create growth and cost savings opportunities through utilizing our low-cost supply chain. The operating results of Knights Apparel from the date of acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements and are reported as part of our Activewear segment.

We incurred $266 million of charges in 2015 related to acquisition, integration and other action related costs. Our current estimate for pretax charges in 2016 for acquisition, integration and other actions is approximately $70 million to $100 million.

Our Segments

Our operations are managed and reported in four operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Activewear, Direct to Consumer and International. These segments are organized principally by product category, geographic location and distribution channel. Each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment’s businesses, but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms. The reportable segments are as follows:



•

Innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in nature under the product categories of intimate apparel, men’s underwear, panties, children’s underwear, socks and hosiery.

•

Activewear sells basic branded products that are primarily seasonal in nature to both retailers and wholesalers, as well as licensed sports apparel and licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores, mass retailers and other channels.

•

Direct to Consumer includes our Company-operated outlet stores, catalogs and website operations that sell our branded products directly to consumers.

•

International primarily relates to the Europe, Asia, Latin America, Canada and Australia geographic locations that sell products that span across the Innerwear and Activewear reportable segments.

Outlook for


We expect our 2016 full year sales to be approximately $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion.

Interest expense and other related expense are expected to be approximately $115 million to $120 million.

We estimate our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 10% and 11% with the rates expected to vary by quarter.

We expect cash flow from operations to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. Net capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million and dividend payments are expected to be roughly $175 million.

Business and Industry Trends

Inflation and Changing Prices

Cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products. While we do not own yarn operations, we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton. Increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large-scale yarn suppliers and may result in the need to implement future price increases in order to maintain our margins. Decreases in cotton prices can lead to lower margins for inventory and products produced from cotton we have already purchased, particularly if there is downward price pressure as a result of consumer demand, competition or other factors.

Our costs for cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton, which is affected by, among other factors, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. We are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton. Under our agreements with these suppliers, we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases. When we elect to fix the cotton cost component under these agreements, interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact the price we pay for the specified volume of yarn. The yarn suppliers bear the risk of cotton fluctuations for the yarn volume specified and it is their responsibility to procure the cotton at the agreed upon pricing through arrangements they make with their cotton suppliers. However, our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices. The cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us represented only approximately 7% of our cost of sales in


. Costs incurred today for materials and labor, including cotton, typically do not impact our results until the inventory is sold approximately six to nine months later.

Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodities and other raw materials, such as dyes and chemicals, and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold. In addition, a significant portion of our products are manufactured in countries other than the United States and declines in the value of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. Increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in consumer income, which also could have a negative impact on spending.

Other Business and Industry Trends

The basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition, price, product quality, selection, service and purchasing convenience. The majority of our core styles continue from year to year, with variations only in color, fabric or design details. Some products, however, such as intimate apparel, activewear and sheer hosiery, do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation. Our businesses face competition from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers, as well as smaller companies, department stores, specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands.



Our top 10 customers accounted for 56% of our net sales. Our largest customers in


were Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl’s, which accounted for

23%

,

15%

and

5%

of total sales, respectively. The increasing bargaining power of retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek greater concessions in their purchase of our products, while also demanding exclusivity of some of our products. To counteract these effects, it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in today’s challenging economic environment. Brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project the quality and value our customers demand.

Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways; a translation impact and a transaction impact. The translation impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our published financial results. Similar to many multi-national corporations that publish financial results in U.S. Dollars, our revenue and profit earned in local foreign currencies is translated back into U.S. Dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. A period of strengthening in the U.S. Dollar results in a negative impact to our published financial results (because it would take more units of a local currency to convert into a dollar). The opposite is true during a period of weakening in the U.S. Dollar. Our biggest foreign currency exposure is the euro.

The transaction impact on financial results is common for apparel companies that source goods because these goods are purchased in U.S. Dollars. The transaction impact from a strengthening dollar would be negative to our financial results (because the U.S. Dollar-based costs would convert into a higher amount of local currency units, which means a higher local-currency cost of goods, and in turn, a lower local-currency gross profit). The transaction impact from exchange rates is typically recovered over time with price increases. However, during periods of rapid change in exchange rates; pricing is unable to change quickly enough, therefore we hedge against our sourcing costs to minimize our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates.

Our Key Business Strategies

Our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy integrates our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost supply chain to provide higher valued products while lowering production costs.

The first element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our brand power. We seek to drive modest sales growth by consistently offering consumers brands they trust and products with unsurpassed value. Our brands have a strong heritage in the basic apparel industry. Our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S. market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete. Internationally, our commercial markets include Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Australia, where a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the United States will be concentrated over the next decade. Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success. Our design, research and product development teams, in partnership with our marketing teams, drive our efforts to bring innovations to market. We seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the basic apparel industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing, addressing changing customer needs and industry trends. We also support our key brands with targeted, effective advertising and marketing campaigns.

The second element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is platform innovation. We are not interested in newness or fashion, but rather focus on identifying the long-term megatrends that will impact our categories over the next five to 10 years. Once we have identified these trends, we utilize a disciplined big-idea process to put more science into the art of apparel. Our approach to innovation is to focus on big platforms. Our Tagless apparel platform, ComfortFlex Fit bra platform and ComfortBlend and X-Temp fabric platforms incorporate big-idea innovation to span brands, product categories, business segments, retailer and distribution channels and geographies. We are focused on driving innovation that is margin accretive and that can leverage our supply chain in order to drive further economies of scale.

The third element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our low-cost global supply chain. We seek to expand margins through optimizing our low-cost global supply chain and streamlining our operations to reduce costs. We believe that we are able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide us with greater manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing power and product design, marketing and customer management resources than our smaller competitors. Our global supply chain spans across both the Western and Eastern hemispheres and provides us with a balanced approach to product supply, which relies on a combination of owned, contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions, increases the efficiency of our operations, reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply. Our global supply chain enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres, thereby diversifying our production risks. We have generated significant cost savings, margin expansion and contributions to cash flow and should continue to do so as we further optimize our size, scale and production capability.

We seek to effectively generate strong cash flow through optimizing our capital structure and managing working capital levels. Our capital allocation strategy is to effectively deploy our significant, consistent cash flow to generate the best long-



term returns for our shareholders. Our goal is to use our cash flow to fund capital investments and dividends, leverage debt for acquisitions and use excess cash flow for share repurchases.

Seasonality and Other Factors

Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. Generally, our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. We generally have higher sales during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather, which benefits certain product categories such as fleece. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers’ decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us. Media, advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions.

Although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned, rather than on an impulse, basis, our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, taxation, gasoline prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factors are outside our control. Consumers’ purchases of discretionary items, including our products, could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. These consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lower-priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products, or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time.

Changes in product sales mix can impact our gross profit as the percentage of our sales attributable to higher margin products, such as intimate apparel and men’s underwear, and lower margin products, such as activewear, fluctuate from time to time. In addition, sales attributable to higher and lower margin products within the same product category fluctuate from time to time. Our customers may change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us, which makes trends in product sales mix difficult to predict. However, certain changes in product sales mix are seasonal in nature, as sales of socks, hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during the last two quarters (July to December) of each fiscal year as a result of cooler weather, back-to-school shopping and holidays, while other changes in product mix may be attributable to customers’ preferences and discretionary spending.

Net Sales

Higher net sales primarily due to the following:

•

Incremental net sales of $445 million and $160 million, from our acquisitions of Hanes Europe Innerwear in August 2014 and Knights Apparel in April 2015, respectively;

•

Growth in our Gear for Sports business within the college bookstore channel and

Champion

products in mid-tier, department and sporting goods stores; and

•

Price increases and strong performance from our ComfortBlend, X-Temp and ComfortFlex Fit innovative platforms.

Offset by lower net sales resulting from:

•

Impact from the 53

rd

week in 2014;

•

The exit of a significant retailer in Canada;

•

Lower shipments in our basics products driven by inventory adjustments at a major mass retailer;

•

The impact of weather on retail traffic and seasonal product lines;

•

The planned exit of certain acquired private label programs; and

•

Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding this impact, consolidated net sales and International segment net sales increased 9% and 54%, respectively.

Gross Profit

The increase in gross profit was attributable to results obtained from our recent acquisitions of Hanes Europe Innerwear and Knights Apparel combined with our supply chain efficiencies, product pricing within our intimates business and favorable product mix within our Activewear segment. Included within gross profit are charges of approximately $63 million and $73 million related to acquisition, integration and other action related costs in


and


, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

As a percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.9% in


compared to 25.2% in


. The higher selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily attributable to charges of $203 million related to acquisition, integration and other action related costs in 2015, compared to $126 million of acquisition, integration and other action related costs in 2014. Also included in 2015 were incremental selling, general and administrative costs of $190 million and $21 million related to Hanes Europe Innerwear and Knights Apparel, respectively. Exclusive of the impact of higher acquisition, integration and other action related costs and the purchases of Hanes Europe Innerwear and Knights Apparel, selling, general and administrative expenses were lower due to tight cost control and synergies gained from the Maidenform acquisition.



Other Highlights

Interest Expense

– higher by $22 million in


compared to


primarily due to higher debt balances related to the acquisition of Knights Apparel and our investment in working capital. Our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was 3.75% during


, compared to 4.05% during


.

Income Tax Expense

– our effective income tax rate was 9.5% and 13.0% in


and


, respectively. The lower effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to income tax benefits of approximately $56 million recognized in 2015 resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Service audit examination of the 2011 and 2012 tax years and the remeasurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits. Offsetting these tax benefits, we elected to repatriate approximately $124 million of current year foreign earnings. In


, there were net discrete tax benefits of approximately $10 million primarily related to the realization of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the lapsing of domestic and foreign statutes of limitations.

Activewear

Activewear sales increased due to the following:

•

Growth in our sports apparel business resulting from our acquisition of Knights Apparel in April 2015 and higher net sales by Gear for Sports in the college bookstore channel; and

•

Higher net sales in our

Champion

branded product in the mid-tier and department stores channel and sporting goods stores;

Offset by:

•

Lower net sales from the impact of weather on retail traffic and seasonal product lines.

Direct to Consumer

Direct to Consumer segment had lower net sales resulting from the 53

rd

week in 2014 and reduced consumer traffic in our outlet stores.

Direct to Consumer segment operating profit decreased primarily due to lower sales.

International

Sales in the International segment were higher as a result of the following:

•

Incremental sales of Hanes Europe Innerwear products as a result of its acquisition in August 2014;

•

Higher sales volume in Asia due to net space gains;

Offset by:

•

$95 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates; and

•

The exit of a significant retailer in Canada.

International segment operating margin decreased primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses associated with Hanes Europe Innerwear and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.



Corporate

Corporate expenses were comprised primarily of certain administrative costs and acquisition, integration and other action related charges totaling $266 million in


as compared to $199 million in


. Acquisition and integration costs are expenses related directly to an acquisition and its integration into the organization. These costs include legal fees, consulting fees, bank fees, severance costs, certain purchase accounting items, facility closures, inventory write-offs, infrastructure (including information technology), and similar charges. Maidenform acquisition and integration costs were completed in 2015.  Foundational costs are expenses associated with building infrastructure to support and integrate current and future acquisitions. Foundational costs were completed in 2015. A significant majority of Other costs are non-cash and relate to the exit of our commercial sales organization in the China market. The main factors that drove the decision to exit the China market were primarily related to the fragmented underwear market and business practices for innerwear and activewear in China that were not conducive to our wholesale business model. Exiting China is immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the International business.

Innerwear

The higher net sales in our Innerwear segment primarily resulted from the following:

•

Incremental sales of Maidenform products;

•

Higher sales in our basics product category, specifically in socks and womens panties, primarily due to higher product pricing;



•

Higher sales in our licensed products, primarily due to higher sales volume.

Offset by:

•

Lower sales in the intimates and hosiery product categories, excluding Maidenform products, as a result of lower sales volume.

Supply chain efficiencies and our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy continue to positively impact our Innerwear segment margins as we are able to increase our price per unit with product innovations and reduce our cost per unit. Offsetting the improvement were higher distribution costs and higher planned media spending.

Activewear

Activewear sales increased due to the following:

•

Higher sales in our

Gear for Sports

licensed apparel, primarily due to net space gains and higher point of sales activity at the retail level;

•

Higher sales for our

Champion

branded product in our retail channel, primarily due to net space gains at retailers;

Incremental sales of Maidenform products;



Offset by:

•

8 percentage point unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

International segment operating margin increased primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by foreign currency exchange rates.

Corporate

Corporate expenses were comprised primarily of certain administrative costs and acquisition, integration and other action related charges totaling $199 million in


as compared to $81 million in


. Acquisition and integration costs are expenses related directly to an acquisition and its integration into the organization. These costs include legal fees, consulting fees, bank fees, severance costs, certain purchase accounting items, facility closures, inventory write-offs, infrastructure (including information technology), and similar charges.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and availability under our Revolving Loan Facility, Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility and international loan facilities. At

January 2, 2016

, we had $921 million of borrowing availability under our $1 billion Revolving Loan Facility (after taking into account outstanding letters of credit), $80 million of borrowing availability under our $275 million Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, $110 million of short-term borrowing availability under our international loan facilities and $319 million in cash and cash equivalents. We currently believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with our available credit capacity, will enable us to comply with the terms of our indebtedness and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements.

The following have impacted or are expected to impact liquidity:

•

we have principal and interest obligations under our debt;

•

we acquired Hanes Europe Innerwear in August 2014 and Knights Apparel in April 2015 and we may pursue strategic acquisitions in the future;

•

we expect to continue to invest in efforts to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs;

•

we made a $100 million contribution to our pension plans in January 2015 and a $40 million contribution in January 2016;

•

we may increase or decrease the portion of the current-year income of our foreign subsidiaries that we remit to the United States, which could significantly impact our effective income tax rate;

•

our Board of Directors has authorized a regular quarterly dividend; and

•

our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of our stock in the open market (12.1 million of which were repurchased during 2015 at a cost of $352 million). Since inception of the program, we have purchased 23.5 million shares, leaving 16.5 million shares authorized for repurchase under the program.



We typically use cash during the first half of the year and generate most of our cash flow in the second half of the year. We expect our cash deployment strategy in the future will include a mix of dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.

Cash Requirements for Our Business

We rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our Revolving Loan Facility, Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility and international loan facilities to meet the cash requirements of our business. The primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the normal course of business, capital expenditures, maturities of debt and related interest payments, contributions to our pension plans, repurchases of our stock and regular quarterly dividend payments. We believe we have sufficient cash and available borrowings for our foreseeable liquidity needs.

Pension Plans

In January 2016, we made a voluntary contribution of $40 million to our pension plans. As a result of this contribution, our U.S. qualified pension plan is approximately 104% funded as of

January 2, 2016

compared to 104% funded as of

January 3, 2015

, under the Pension Protection Act funding rules. We are not required to make any additional cash contributions to our pension plans in 2016 based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary. We may elect to make additional voluntary contributions during


to maintain certain funded levels. See Note, “Defined Pension Benefit Plans,” to our financial statements for more information on the plan asset and pension expense components.

Share Repurchase Program

On February 1, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors granted authority for the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of our common stock. Share repurchases are made periodically in open-market transactions, and are subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Additionally, management has been granted authority to establish a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act in connection with share repurchases, which will allow us to repurchase shares in the open market during periods in which the stock trading window is otherwise closed for our company and certain of our officers and employees pursuant to our insider trading policy. During 2015, we purchased 12.1 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $352 million (average price of $28.91). Since inception of the program, we have purchased 23.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $426 million (average price per share of $18.13). The primary objective of our share repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution caused by the exercise of options and vesting of stock unit awards, as well as utilize excess cash flow to generate shareholder value. While we may repurchase additional stock under the program, we may choose not to repurchase any stock and focus more on other uses of cash in the next 12 months.

Dividends

As part of our cash deployment strategy, in 2013, our Board of Directors declared our first dividends of $0.05 per share on outstanding common stock, which were paid in 2013. Prior to that declaration, we had not paid a cash dividend on our common stock.

In 2014, our Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.075 per share on outstanding common stock which were paid in 2014.

In January 2015, April 2015, July 2015 and October 2015, our Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.10 per share on outstanding common stock which were paid on March 3, 2015, June 11, 2015, September 9, 2015 and December 8, 2015. In addition, the Board of Directors authorized a four-for-one stock split in the form of a 300% stock dividend, which was implemented on March 3, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 9, 2015.

In January 2016, our Board of Directors declared a regularly quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share on outstanding common stock to be paid on March 8, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business day on February 16, 2016.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of SEC Regulation S-K.



Future Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The following table contains information on our contractual obligations and commitments as of

January 2, 2016

, and their expected timing on future cash flows and liquidity.

(1)

Interest obligations on floating rate debt instruments are calculated for future periods using interest rates in effect at

January 2, 2016

.

(2)

Represents the projected payment for long-term liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for certain employee benefit claims, royalty-bearing license agreement payments, deferred compensation, capital leases and uncertain tax positions.

Funding contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are not included in the table above because it is uncertain whether or when further contributions will be required. We are not required to make any additional cash contributions to our pension plans in 2016 based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary. In January 2016, we made a voluntary contribution of $40 million. We may elect to make additional voluntary contributions during 2016 to maintain certain funded levels.

Sources and Uses of Our Cash

The information presented below regarding the sources and uses of our cash flows for the years ended

January 2, 2016

and

January 3, 2015

was derived from our financial statements.

Operating Activities

Our overall liquidity is primarily driven by our strong cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on net income and changes in working capital. Although net income increased in 2015 from improved operating performance, cash flow provided by operating activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the following:

•

The build in inventory levels in 2015. In 2016 we expect to reduce our inventory levels through adjustments to our manufacturing production schedule, internalizing additional production and by drawing down our raw materials and work-in-process;

•

$100 million pension contribution in 2015; and



•

Decreased accounts receivable collections in 2015 due to the timing of sales within the fourth quarter year-over-year.

Investing Activities

The lower net cash used for investing activities was primarily the result of the net cash of $193 million used for the acquisition of Knights Apparel in April 2015 as compared to the net cash used for the acquisition of Hanes Europe Innerwear in August 2014 of $360 million and 2014 proceeds from the sale of investments of $64 million, offset by higher net capital expenditures of $27 million in


.

Financing Activities

The higher net cash from financing activities was primarily the result of higher net cash borrowings on our loan facilities, specifically new borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The decision to increase our net borrowings was driven by our cash deployment strategy and utilized for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends in order to continue generating shareholder value.

Financing Arrangements

We believe our financing structure provides a secure base to support our operations and key business strategies. As of

January 2, 2016

, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facilities and other outstanding indebtedness discussed below. We continue to monitor our covenant compliance carefully in this difficult economic environment. We expect to maintain compliance with our covenants during


, however economic conditions or the occurrence of events discussed above under “Risk Factors” could cause noncompliance.

We have significant liquidity from our available cash balances and credit facilities. We maintain a senior secured credit facility (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”) consisting of a Revolving Loan Facility of $1,000,000, a $725,000 term loan a facility (the “Term Loan A”), a $425,000 term loan b facility (the “Term Loan B”) and a €363,000 euro term loan facility (the “Euro Term Loan Facility”). Our Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility provides for up to $275,000 in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing, limited to the availability of eligible receivables, and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables. As of January 2, 2016, $920,817 of our Revolving Loan Facility was available for borrowing. Refer to Note, “Debt”, for a complete overview of our credit facilities.

Notes Payable

Notes payable were

$118 million

at

January 2, 2016

and

$144 million

at

January 3, 2015

. At

January 2, 2016

, we had

$110 million

of borrowing availability under our international loan facilities.

Undistributed Earnings from Foreign Subsidiaries

As of

January 2, 2016

, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately $2.7 billion, of which $319 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested, and less than $1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are not considered permanently reinvested. Our intention is to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings we have previously asserted as being permanently reinvested in our international operations. We reassess our reinvestment assertions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient other sources of liquidity to support our assertion that such undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently.

We repatriated $124 million, $15 million and $10 million in


,


and


, respectively, from earnings generated in such years. The amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during


will be determined, based upon a variety of factors including current year earnings of the foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the U.S., such as for the repayment of debt and other domestic obligations. The majority of our repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries has historically occurred at year-end, although we may always repatriate funds earlier in the year based on the needs of our business. When we repatriate funds to the U.S., we are required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable U.S. tax rates, net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against U.S. income tax. There was a cost of $43 million, $1 million and $1 million in additional U.S. federal income taxes in


,


and


, respectively, as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in such years.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our financial statements.

The application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known. The critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors, are described below:

Sales Recognition and Incentives

We recognize revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, which occurs primarily upon shipment. We record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience.

Note, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” (d), “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Sales Recognition and Incentives,” to our financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products. Measuring the cost of these incentives requires, in many cases, estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates. We use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information. We classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of “Net sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Accounts Receivable Valuation

Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers. We carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and our customers’ financial strength, credit standing and payment and default history. Changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. Charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the “Net sales” line of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a large reserve might be required. The amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts.

Inventory Valuation

We carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out, or “FIFO,” method for our inventories. We carry obsolete, damaged and excess inventory at the net realizable value, which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates, current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans. Because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time, there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination. Market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change, resulting in further reserve requirements. A reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period. While we believe that adequate write-downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the financial statements, consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write-downs in the future.

Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item, and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold.



Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities, as well as for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, at tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies. If in our judgment it appears that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.

We have not provided federal income taxes on that portion of our foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings that is permanently reinvested in their respective foreign jurisdictions. If we decided to remit those earnings to the U.S. in a future period due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements, our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate could be impacted.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. These assessments of uncertain tax positions contain judgments related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, expiration of statutes of limitations, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which these events occur.

Stock Compensation

We established the Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (As Amended and Restated) (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”) to award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash to our employees, non-employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees. Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. We estimate forfeitures for stock-based awards granted that are not expected to vest. If any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

For a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost, plan obligations, plan assets and how we measure the amount of these costs, see Note, “Defined Benefit Pension Plans,” to our consolidated financial statements. The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet. Differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in comprehensive income. We measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year end.

The net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long-term rate of asset return. The net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred. Gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are amortized over the average future expected life of participants. As benefits under the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension Plan are frozen, year over year fluctuations in our pension expense are not expected to be material and not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows:

•

In determining the discount rate, we utilized the Aon Hewitt AA Above Median Curve (rounded to the nearest 10 basis points) in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan. Beginning in 2016, we will begin utilizing specific spot rates along the full yield curve in our determination of discount rates, for our U.S. defined benefit plans, in order to determine our interest rate and match to the relevant cash flows for the plans. This change will improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest costs.

•

Salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions. The salary increase assumption only applies to the Canadian plans, certain Hanes Europe Innerwear plans and portions of the Hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans, as benefits under these plans are not frozen. The benefits under the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension Plan were frozen as of December 31, 2005.



•

In determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical long-term compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments, and the utilization of forward-looking assumptions.

•

Retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality. In


, the tables used as a basis for the mortality assumption were updated from the RP-2000 table and AA scale to the RP-2015 table and MP-2015 scale, respectively.

The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans’ benefit obligations, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following:

Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangibles

Trademarks, license agreements, customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets. We amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives over their estimated useful lives, and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives. We base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors, including the effects of demand, competition, expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows. As of

January 2, 2016

, the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was

$701

million, of which we are amortizing a balance of

$211

million. We anticipate that our amortization expense for


will be

$20

million.

We evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under “— Depreciation and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment.” We assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually, as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter, and more often as triggering events occur. In order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets, we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. Fair values of intangible assets are primarily based on future cash flows projected to be generated from that asset. We recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.

Goodwill

As of

January 2, 2016

, we had

$834 million

of goodwill. We do not amortize goodwill, but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur. The timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter. The estimated fair values significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter, and no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in


.

In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill in


, we estimated the fair value of our reporting units. We relied on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows, including operating results, business plans and present value techniques. As discussed above under “Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangibles,” there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors, and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future. Such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known.

Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations

We account for business combinations using the purchase method, which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize the excess of an acquired business’ cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill. We use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. We generally use third party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles, consulting actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claims.



Depreciation and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment

We state property, plant and equipment at its historical cost, and we compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the asset’s life. We estimate an asset’s life based on historical experience, manufacturers’ estimates, engineering or appraisal evaluations, our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us, which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life. Our policies require that we periodically review our assets’ remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization. A change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods.

We test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in business climate, several periods of operating or cash flow losses, forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We evaluate an asset’s recoverability by comparing the asset or asset group’s net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate. If we determine that an asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

When we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use, we depreciate the asset’s adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life. We do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances change.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our risk management control system uses analytical techniques including market value, sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars; however, we purchase some raw materials, pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the Euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. We use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our forward and option contracts. At

January 2, 2016

, the potential change in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments, assuming a 10% adverse change in the underlying currency price, was $26 million.

Interest Rates

Our debt under the Revolving Loan Facility, Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Euro Term Loan and Other International Debt bears interest at variable rates. As a result, we are exposed to changes in market interest rates that could impact the cost of servicing our debt. Approximately 40% of our total debt outstanding at

January 2, 2016

is at a fixed rate. A 25-basis point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of

January 2, 2016

would only result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $4 million.

Commodities

We are exposed to commodity price fluctuations primarily as a result of the cost of materials that are used in our manufacturing process. Cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products.  Under our current agreements with our primary yarn suppliers, we have the ability to periodically fix the cotton cost component of our yarn purchases so that the suppliers bear the risk of cotton price fluctuation for the specified yarn volume and interim fluctuations in the price of cotton do not impact our costs. However, our business can be affected by sustained dramatic movements in cotton prices.

In addition, fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products, such as chemicals, dyestuffs, polyester yarn and foam, as well as affect our transportation and utility costs.  We generally purchase raw materials at market prices.

Hanesbrands Inc.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Hanesbrands Inc. (“Hanesbrands”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a — 15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Hanesbrands’ system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Hanesbrands; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of Hanesbrands are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Hanesbrands; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Hanesbrands’ assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

The Company excluded its wholly owned subsidiary, Knights Holdco, Inc. (“Knights Apparel”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2016 because its control over this operation was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2015. The total assets and total revenues of Knights Apparel represented 5% and 3%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended January 2, 2016.

Management has evaluated the effectiveness of Hanesbrands’ internal control over financial reporting as of

January 2, 2016

, based upon criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on our evaluation, management determined that Hanesbrands’ internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

January 2, 2016

.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

January 2, 2016

has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included on the following page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Hanesbrands Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hanesbrands Inc. (the “Company”) at January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 2, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in the Report of Management on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Knights Apparel from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of January 2, 2016, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2015. We have also excluded Knights Apparel from our audit of internal controls over financial reporting. Knights Apparel is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent 5% and 3%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended January 2, 2016.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b) Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, certain financial statement disclosures at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may vary from these estimates.

(c) Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates. Translation adjustments resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCI”) within stockholders’ equity. The Company translates the results of operations of its foreign operations at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

(d) Sales Recognition and Incentives

The Company recognizes revenue when (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and (iv) collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, which occurs primarily upon shipment. The Company records a sales reduction for returns and allowances based upon historical return experience. The Company earns royalty revenues through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate certain of the Company’s brands. The Company accrues revenue earned under these contracts based upon reported sales from the licensee. The Company offers a variety of sales incentives to resellers and consumers of its products, and the policies regarding the recognition and display of these incentives within the Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows:

Discounts, Coupons, and Rebates

The Company recognizes the cost of these incentives at the later of the date at which the related sale is recognized or the date at which the incentive is offered. The cost of these incentives is estimated using a number of factors, including historical utilization and redemption rates. All cash incentives of this type are included in the determination of net sales. The Company includes incentives offered in the form of free products in the determination of cost of sales.

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

Volume-Based Incentives

These incentives typically involve rebates or refunds of cash that are redeemable only if the reseller completes a specified number of sales transactions. Under these incentive programs, the Company estimates the anticipated rebate to be paid and allocates a portion of the estimated cost of the rebate to each underlying sales transaction with the customer. The Company includes these amounts in the determination of net sales.

Cooperative Advertising

Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to reimburse the reseller for a portion of the costs incurred by the reseller to advertise and promote certain of the Company’s products. The Company recognizes the cost of cooperative advertising programs in the period in which the advertising and promotional activity first takes place.

Fixtures and Racks

Store fixtures and racks are periodically used by resellers to display Company products. The Company expenses the cost of these fixtures and racks in the period in which they are delivered to the resellers. The Company includes the costs of fixtures and racks incurred by resellers and charged back to the Company in the determination of net sales. Fixtures and racks purchased by the Company and provided to resellers are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

(e) Advertising Expense

Advertising costs, which include the development and production of advertising materials and the communication of these materials through various forms of media, are expensed in the period the advertising first takes place. The Company recognized advertising expense in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” caption in the Consolidated Statements of Income of

$181,956

,

$183,333

and

$161,541

in

$332,678

,

$295,280

and

$241,026

in


,


and


, respectively. The Company recognizes shipping, handling and distribution costs in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

(g) Catalog Expenses

The Company incurs expenses for printing catalogs for products to aid in the Company’s sales efforts. The Company initially records these expenses as a prepaid item and charges it against selling, general and administrative expenses over time as the catalog is used. Expenses are recognized at a rate that approximates historical experience with regard to the timing and amount of sales attributable to a catalog distribution.

(h) Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. Research and development includes expenditures for new product, technological improvements for existing products and process innovation, which primarily consist of salaries, consulting and supplies attributable to time spent on research and development activities. Additional costs include depreciation and maintenance for research and development equipment and facilities. Research and development expense was

$62,324

,

$63,268

and

$51,316

in


,


and


, respectively.

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

(j) Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of

three months or less

at the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

(k) Accounts Receivable Valuation

Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, aging of trade receivables, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information.

(l) Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the estimated lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out, or “FIFO,” method for inventories. Obsolete, damaged, and excess inventory is carried at the net realizable value, which is determined by assessing historical recovery rates, current market conditions and future marketing and sales plans. Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item, and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold.

(m) Property

Property is stated at historical cost and depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and equipment is depreciated over periods ranging from

three

to

15 years

and buildings and building improvements over periods of up to


years. A change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods. Additions and improvements that substantially extend the useful life of a particular asset and interest costs incurred during the construction period of major properties are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or disposition of an asset, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts.

Property is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in the business climate, several periods of operating or cash flow losses, forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. Recoverability of property is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful life. Restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is not permitted under U.S. GAAP.

(n) Trademarks and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

The primary identifiable intangible assets of the Company are trademarks, license agreements, customer and distributor relationships and computer software. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives are not amortized. The estimated useful life of a finite-lived intangible asset is based upon a number of factors, including the effects of demand, competition, expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows. Trademarks with finite lives are being amortized over periods ranging from

seven

to

30 years

, license agreements are being amortized over periods ranging from

three

to

17 years

, customer and distributor relationships are being amortized over periods ranging from

two

to

15 years

and computer software and other intangibles are being amortized over periods ranging from

one

to

seven years

.

Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating elements of property. Identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment at least annually, as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter, and as triggering events occur. The impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess. In assessing fair value, management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results, business plans and present value techniques. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the

F-11


HANESBRANDS INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)

Years ended January 2, 2016, January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

cost of capital at a point in time. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of intangible asset impairment.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs, which include the actual costs to purchase software from vendors and generally include personnel and related costs for employees who were directly associated with the enhancement and implementation of purchased computer software. Additions to computer software are included in purchases of property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

(o) Goodwill

Goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. When a business combination is completed, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to the reporting unit or units of the Company given responsibility for managing, controlling and generating returns on these assets and liabilities. In many instances, all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities are assigned to a single reporting unit and in these cases all of the goodwill is assigned to the same reporting unit. In those situations in which the acquired assets and liabilities are allocated to more than one reporting unit, the goodwill to be assigned to each reporting unit is determined in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined.

Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is assessed for impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur. The Company’s annual measurement date is the first day of the third fiscal quarter. In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to the carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the next step of the process involves comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit. If the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess.

No

impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in


. In estimating the fair values of the reporting units, management relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future cash flows including operating results, business plans and present value techniques. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

(p) Insurance Reserves

The Company is self-insured for property, workers’ compensation, medical and other casualty programs up to certain stop-loss limits. Undiscounted liabilities for self-insured exposures are accrued at the present value of the expected aggregate losses below those limits and are based on a number of assumptions, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions.

(q) Stock-Based Compensation

The Company established the Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (As Amended and Restated), (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”) to award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash to its employees, non-employee directors and employees of its subsidiaries to promote the interests of the Company and incent performance and retention of employees. The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of those awards.

(r) Income Taxes

Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Given continuing losses in certain jurisdictions in which the Company operates on a separate return basis, a valuation allowance has been established for the deferred tax assets in these specific locations. The Company periodically estimates the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgment. There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company transacts business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, regulations. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur, and these adjustments are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. If such changes take place, there is a risk that the Company’s effective tax rate may increase or decrease in any period. A company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more

likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.

(s) Financial Instruments

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposures to movements in foreign exchange rates. The use of these financial instruments modifies the Company’s exposure to these risks with the goal of reducing the risk or cost to the Company. Depending on the nature of the underlying risk being hedged, these financial instruments are either designated as cash flow hedges or are economic hedges against changes in the value of the hedged item and therefore not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The Company does not use derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative contracts.

On the date the derivative is entered into, the Company determines whether the derivative meets the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting treatment or whether the financial instrument is serving as an economic hedge against changes in the value of the hedged item and therefore is not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes. The accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship.

The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, or if the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any deferred gains or losses are recorded in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified as current or noncurrent based on the derivatives’ maturity dates. The fair value is based upon either market quotes for actively traded instruments or independent bids for nonexchange traded instruments. Cash flows hedges are classified in the same category as the item being hedged, and cash flows from derivative contracts not designated as hedges are classified as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by individual counterparties or the entire group of counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts. Risk of nonperformance by counterparties is mitigated by dealing with highly rated counterparties and by diversifying across counterparties.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in the “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When the hedged item affects the income statement, the gain or loss included in AOCI is reported on the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Income as the hedged item. In addition, both the fair value of changes excluded from the Company’s effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges are reported in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedges

For derivative contracts not designated as hedges, changes in fair value are reported in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts are recorded at fair value when the hedged item is recorded as an asset or liability and then are revalued each accounting period.

(t) Assets and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method, which requires the Company to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The Company recognizes the excess of an acquired business’ cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill.

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

Fair values are determined using the income approach based on market participant assumptions focusing on future cash flow projections and accepted industry standards.

(u) Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Discontinued Operations

In April 2014, the FASB issued new accounting rules related to updating the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhancing related disclosures requirements. The new rules were effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2015. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Extraordinary and Unusual Items

In January 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules that remove the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP. Under the existing guidance, an entity is required to separately disclose extraordinary items, net of tax, in the income statement after income from continuing operations if an event or transaction is of an unusual nature and occurs infrequently. This separate, net-of-tax presentation (and corresponding earnings per share impact) will no longer be allowed. The new rules will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Consolidation

In February 2015, the FASB issued an update to their existing consolidation model, which changes the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The new rules will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Debt Issuance Costs

In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, which require debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. The new rules will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Cloud Computing

In April 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, related to a customer’s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The guidance provides clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a software license is included, the customer should account for the license consistent with its accounting for other software licenses. If a software license is not included, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Fair Value Measurement

In May 2015, the FASB issued an update to their accounting guidance related to fair value measurements. The guidance removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient, and requires separate disclosure of those investments instead. These disclosures will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The new accounting rules will not have an impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows but will result in certain additional disclosures.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay effective dates for the new accounting rules related to revenue recognition for contracts with customers by one year. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018 with

(amounts in thousands, except per share data)

retrospective application required. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the new rules on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Inventory

In July 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, which require inventory to be recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The new standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Measurement Period Adjustments

In September 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, which simplify the accounting for measurement period adjustments by eliminating the requirements to restate prior period financial statements for these adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new standard, which should be applied prospectively to measurement period adjustments that occur after the effective date, is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new accounting rules to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

In November 2015, the FASB issued new accounting rules, intended to improve how deferred taxes are classified on organizations’ balance sheets. The new guidance eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will now be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The new standard is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017, and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively. The Company has elected to adopt the standard early, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, and will apply the standard retrospectively. The adoption of the new accounting rules did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

(v) Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, none of which are material, have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. These classifications within the statements had no impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) was computed by dividing net income by the number of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS was calculated to give effect to all potentially dilutive shares of common stock using the treasury stock method. On March 3, 2015, the Company implemented a

four

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company established the Omnibus Incentive Plan to award stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash to its employees, non-employee directors and employees of its subsidiaries to promote the interests of the Company and incent performance and retention of employees.

Stock Options

The exercise price of each stock option equals the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. Options granted vest ratably over

three

years and can be exercised over a term of


years. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. There were no options granted during any of the periods presented.

Stock Unit Awards

Restricted stock units (RSUs) of the Company’s stock are granted to certain Company non-employee directors and employees to incent performance and retention over periods of

one

to

three years

, respectively. Upon vesting, the RSUs are converted into shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis and issued to the grantees. Some RSUs which have been granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan vest upon continued future service to the Company, while others also have a performance-based vesting feature. The cost of these awards is determined using the fair value of the shares on the date of grant, and compensation expense is recognized over the period during which the grantees provide the requisite service to the Company. A summary of the changes in the restricted stock unit awards outstanding under the Omnibus Incentive Plan is presented below:

0%

to

200%

of the number of units granted based on the Company’s achievement of certain performance metrics. These performanced-based stock awards, which are included in the table above, represent awards that are earned based on future performance and service. As reported in the above table, the number of performanced-based restricted stock units granted each year represents the initial units granted on the date of grant plus any additional units that were earned based on the final achievement of the respective performance thresholds.

Allowances for Trade Accounts Receivable

The changes in the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for chargebacks and other deductions are as follows:

Charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the “Net sales” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. Deductions and write-offs, which do not increase or decrease income, represent write-offs of previously reserved accounts receivable and allowed customer chargebacks and deductions against gross accounts receivable.

Senior Secured Credit Facility

On April 29, 2015, the Company refinanced its senior secured credit facility (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”) to extend the maturity date of the revolving loan facility (the “Revolving Loan Facility”) to April 2020 and reduce the maximum borrowing capacity from

$1,100,000

to

$1,000,000

, re-price the Revolving Loan Facility at favorable rates, and add an additional

$850,000

in term loan borrowings (

$425,000

for a new Term Loan A and

$425,000

for a new Term Loan B. The Company incurred

$10,900

in fees related to this refinancing. The proceeds of the Term Loan A and the Term Loan B were used to refinance existing revolving borrowings under the prior senior secured credit facility, pay fees and expenses in connection with the closing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. Proceeds of the Revolving Loan Facility are used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs. On October 23, 2015, the Company amended the Senior Secured Credit Facility to increase the principal amount of the Term Loan A by an additional

$300,000

. The Company incurred

$1,603

in fees related to this refinancing.

In July 2014, the Company amended and restated the Senior Secured Credit Facility to increase the committed aggregate facility size to

$1,600,000

(from

$1,100,000

), consisting of (a) Revolving Loan Facility, and (b) the Euro Term Loan. The Euro Term Loan accrues interest utilizing the EURIBOR rate (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility) plus

2.75%

. The proceeds of the Euro Term Loan are denominated in Euros and were utilized in part to purchase Hanes Europe Innerwear. Proceeds of the Revolving Loan Facility are used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs. All borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility must be repaid in full upon maturity. Outstanding borrowings under the Euro Term Loan are repayable in quarterly payments of

0.25%

of the original borrowings, with the remainder of the outstanding principle due at maturity.

All borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility must be repaid in full upon maturity.

Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan A are repayable in equal quarterly installments in the following annual percentages, with the remainder of the outstanding principal to be repaid at maturity: year one,

5.0%

; year two,

7.5%

; years three and four,

10.0%

; and year five,

15.0%

.

Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan B are repayable in

0.25%

quarterly installments, with the remainder of the outstanding principal to be repaid at maturity. If the Term Loan B is repriced or refinanced on or prior to the twelve month anniversary of its funding and as a result of such repricing or refinancing the effective interest rate of the Term Loan B decreases, the Company shall be required to pay a prepayment fee equal to

1.0%

of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan B subject to such repricing or refinancing.

A portion of the Revolving Loan Facility is available for the issuances of letters of credit and the making of swingline loans, and any such issuance of letters of credit or making of a swingline loan will reduce the amount available under the Revolving Loan Facility. At the Company’s option, it may add one or more term loan facilities or increase the commitments under the Revolving Loan Facility so long as certain conditions are satisfied, including, among others, that no default or event of default is in existence, that the Company is in pro forma compliance with the financial covenants described below and that the Company’s senior secured leverage ratio is less than

3.00

to 1 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the incurrence of such indebtedness. As of

The Senior Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s existing and future direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon exceptions for foreign subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries. The Company and each of the guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facility have granted the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility a valid and perfected first priority (subject to certain customary exceptions) lien and security interest in the following:

•

the equity interests of substantially all of the Company’s direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries (other than U.S. subsidiaries directly or indirectly owned by foreign subsidiaries) and

65%

of the voting securities of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries; and

•

substantially all present and future property and assets, real and personal, tangible and intangible, of the Company and each guarantor, except for certain enumerated interests, and all proceeds and products of such property and assets.

Additionally, the Euro Term Loan is guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s subsidiary MFB International Holdings S.à r.l.’s (“MFB International Holdings”) existing and future direct and indirect subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon exceptions for certain subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of 100% of the equity interests of MFB International Holdings and its direct subsidiaries, 100% of the equity interests owned by any subsidiary of MFB International Holdings that is domiciled in Luxembourg and substantially all present and future property and assets, real and personal, tangible and intangible, of each Luxembourg domiciled guarantor, except for certain enumerated interests, and all proceeds and products of such property and assets.

The Term Loan A, the Term Loan B and the Company’s Euro Term Loan require the Company and its subsidiary Maidenform Luxembourg (“MF Lux”), as applicable, to prepay any outstanding Term Loans in connection with (i) the incurrence of certain indebtedness and (ii) non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds in any period of twelve-consecutive months, with customary reinvestment provisions. The Term Loan B and the Euro Term Loan also require the Company and MF Lux, as applicable, to prepay any outstanding Term Loans under the Term Loan B and the Euro Term Loan in connection with excess cash flow, which percentage will be based upon the Company’s leverage ratio during the relevant fiscal period. All such prepayments will be made on a pro rata basis under each of the applicable Term Loans that are subject to such prepayments.

At the Company’s option, borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility, the Term Loan A and the Term Loan B bear interest based on the LIBOR rate or the “base rate” plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the Revolving Loan Facility and the Term Loan A is determined by reference to a leverage-based pricing grid set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, ranging from a maximum of

2.00%

in the case of LIBOR-based loans and

1.00%

in the case of Base Rate loans if the Company’s leverage ratio is greater than or equal to

4.00

to 1, and will step down in

0.25%

increments to a minimum of

1.25%

in the case of LIBOR-based loans and

0.25%

in the case of Base Rate loans if the Company’s leverage ratio is less than

2.50

to 1. The applicable margin under the Term Loan B is

2.50%

in the case of LIBOR-based loans and

1.50%

in the case of Base Rate loans.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants. The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to EBITDA (earnings before income taxes, depreciation expense and amortization, as computed pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facility), or leverage ratio. The interest coverage ratio covenant requires that the ratio of the Company’s EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters to its consolidated total interest expense for such period shall not be less than

3.0

to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter. The leverage ratio covenant requires that the ratio of the Company’s total debt to EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters will not be more than

4.0

to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter provided that, following a permitted acquisition in which the consideration is at least

$200,000

, such maximum leverage ratio covenant shall be increased to

4.5

to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter ending in the succeeding 12-month period following such permitted acquisition. The method of calculating all of the components used in the covenants is included in the Senior Secured Credit Facility.

In addition, the commitment fee for the unused portion of revolving loan commitments made by the Lenders is between


and


basis points based on the applicable commitment fee margin in effect from time to time. When the Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility) is greater than or equal to

4.00

to 1.00, the commitment fee margin is

0.350%

. When the Leverage Ratio is less than

4.00

to 1.00 but greater than or equal to

3.25

to 1.00, the applicable commitment fee margin is

0.300%

. When the Leverage Ratio is less than

3.25

to 1.00, the applicable commitment fee margin is

0.250%

The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts after stated grace period; material inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; any cross-default to material indebtedness; certain material judgments; certain events related to the ERISA, actual or asserted invalidity of any guarantee, security document or subordination provision or non-perfection of security interest, and a change in control (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility). As of

January 2, 2016

the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.

6.375% Senior Notes

On November 9, 2010, the Company issued

$1,000,000

aggregate principal amount of the

6.375%

Senior Notes. The

6.375%

Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness. The

6.375%

Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to

6.375%

. Interest is payable on the

6.375%

Senior Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The

6.375%

Senior Notes will mature on

December 15, 2020

. The net proceeds from the sale of the

6.375%

Senior Notes were approximately

$979,000

. The net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under another loan facility, reduce the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility and to pay fees and expenses relating to these transactions. The

6.375%

Senior Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries.

The indenture governing the

6.375%

Senior Notes contains customary events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of other agreements in such indenture; failure to pay certain other indebtedness; failure to pay certain final judgments; failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable; and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility

The Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility provides for up to

$275,000

in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing, limited to the availability of eligible receivables, and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables. Under the terms of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries sell, on a revolving basis, certain domestic trade receivables to HBI Receivables LLC (“Receivables LLC”), a wholly owned bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that in turn uses the trade receivables to secure the borrowings, which are funded through conduits and financial institutions that are not affiliated with the Company. The commitments of any conduits party to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility are funded through the issuance of commercial paper in the short-term market or through committed bank purchasers if the conduits fail to fund. The assets and liabilities of Receivables LLC are fully reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the securitization is treated as a secured borrowing for accounting purposes, but the assets of Receivables LLC will be used first to satisfy the creditors of Receivables LLC, not the Company’s creditors. The borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility remain outstanding throughout the term of the agreement subject to the Company maintaining sufficient eligible receivables, by continuing to sell trade receivables to Receivables LLC, unless an event of default occurs. In March 2015, the Company amended the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility to decrease certain fee rates and extended the termination date to March 11, 2016.

Availability of funding under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility depends primarily upon the eligible outstanding receivables balance. The outstanding balance under the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the line “Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility.” In the case of any creditors party to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility that are conduits, unless the conduits fail to fund, the yield on the commercial paper, which is the conduits’ cost to issue the commercial paper plus certain dealer fees, is considered a financing cost and is included in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. If the conduits fail to fund, the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility would be funded through committed bank purchasers, and the interest rate would be payable at the Company’s option at the rate announced from time to time by HSBC Bank USA, N.A. as its prime rate or at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility) plus the applicable margin in effect from time to time. In the case of borrowings from any other creditors party to the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility that are not conduits or their related committed bank purchasers, the interest rate is payable at the LIBO Rate (as defined in the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility) or, if this rate is unavailable or otherwise does not accurately reflect the costs to these creditors related to the borrowings, the prime rate. These amounts are also considered financing costs and are included in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, HBI Receivables LLC is required to make certain payments to a conduit purchaser, a committed purchaser, or certain entities that provide funding to or are affiliated with them, in the event that assets

and liabilities of a conduit purchaser are consolidated for financial and/or regulatory accounting purposes with certain other entities.

The Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility contains customary events of default and requires the Company to maintain the same interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio contained from time to time in the Senior Secured Credit Facility, provided that any changes to such covenants will only be applicable for purposes of the Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility if approved by the Managing Agents or their affiliates. As of

January 2, 2016

, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.

The total amount of receivables used as collateral for the credit facility was

$132,574

as of the acquisition date. Concurrent with the closing,

$107,665

These loans have maturity dates ranging from January, 2016 to May, 2018, and bear interest primarily based on EURIBOR rates ranging from

1.49%

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is a party to various pending legal proceedings, claims and environmental actions by government agencies. In accordance with the accounting rules for contingencies, the Company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated. Any provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information pertinent to the particular matter. The recorded liabilities for these items were not material to the consolidated financial statements of the Company in any of the years presented. Although the outcome of such items cannot be determined with certainty, the Company’s legal counsel and management are of the opinion that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Purchase Commitments

In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into purchase commitments for raw materials, production and finished goods. These agreements, typically with terms ending within a year, require total payments of

The Company is party to several royalty-bearing license agreements for the use of third party trademarks in certain of their products. The license agreements typically require a minimum guarantee to be paid either at the commencement of the agreement, by a designated date during the term of the agreement or by the end of the agreement period. When payments are made in advance of when they are due, the Company records a prepayment and amortizes the expense in the “Cost of sales” line of the Consolidated Statements of Income uniformly over the guaranteed period. For guarantees required to be paid at the completion of the agreement, royalties are expensed through “Cost of sales” as the related sales are made. Management has reviewed all license agreements and has concluded that there are no liabilities recorded at inception of the agreements.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposures to movements in foreign exchange rates. As of

January 2, 2016

, the notional U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell and purchase foreign currencies within the Company’s derivative portfolio were

$265,136

and

$6,099

, respectively, consisting of contracts hedging primarily exposures to the Euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, Japanese yen, Brazilian real and South African rand.

As of

, the notional U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell and purchase foreign currencies within the Company’s derivative portfolio were

$163,873

and

consisting of contracts hedging primarily exposures to the Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Japanese yen.

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

The fair values of derivative financial instruments related to forward foreign exchange contracts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company were as follows:

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short-term foreign currency-denominated transactions, foreign currency-denominated investments, and other known foreign currency exposures. Gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset losses and gains on the hedged transaction in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company expects to reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months a net gain from AOCI of approximately

$7,016

.

The changes in fair value of derivatives excluded from the Company’s effectiveness assessments and the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges are reported in the “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivative Contracts Not Designated As Hedges

The Company uses foreign exchange derivative contracts as economic hedges against the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on anticipated intercompany purchase and lending transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Gains or losses on these contracts largely offset the net remeasurement gains or losses on the related assets and liabilities.

The effect of derivative contracts not designated as hedges on the Consolidated Statements of Income is as follows:

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

Fair value is an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value, is utilized for disclosing the fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques:

•

Market approach — prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

•

Cost approach — amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost.

•

Income approach — techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing and other models.

The Company primarily applies the market approach for commodity derivatives and for all defined benefit plan investment assets and the income approach for interest rate and foreign currency derivatives for recurring fair value measurements and attempts to utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to

the fair value measurement. The determination of fair values incorporates various factors that include not only the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements, but also the impact of the Company’s nonperformance risk on its liabilities. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.

As of

January 2, 2016

and

January 3, 2015

, the Company held certain financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These consisted of the Company’s derivative instruments related to interest rates and foreign exchange rates and defined benefit pension plan investment assets. The fair values of interest rate and foreign exchange rate derivatives are determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets and are categorized as Level 2. The fair values of defined benefit pension plan investments include: certain U.S. equity securities, certain foreign equity securities and debt securities that are determined based on quoted prices in public markets categorized as Level 1, certain foreign equity securities, certain U.S. equity securities, debt securities, insurance contracts and commodity investments that are determined based on inputs readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets categorized as Level 2 and investments in hedge funds of funds and real estate investments that are based on unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists that are classified as Level 3. There were no changes during


to the Company’s valuation techniques used to measure asset and liability fair values on a recurring basis. The hedge fund of funds and real estate investments have varying redemption terms of monthly, quarterly, semi-annually and annually, and have required notification periods ranging from


to

90 days

As of

January 2, 2016

, the Company did not have any non-financial assets or liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Accrued benefit costs related to the Company’s defined benefit pension plans are reported in the “Accrued liabilities — Payroll and employee benefits” and “Pension and postretirement benefits” lines of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(a) Measurement Date and Assumptions

A December 31 measurement date is used to value plan assets and obligations for the pension plans. In determining the discount rate, the Company utilizes, as a general benchmark, the single discount rate equivalent to discounting the expected cash flows from each plan using the yields at each duration from a published yield curve as of the measurement date. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was based on the Company’s investment policy target allocation of the asset portfolio between various asset classes and the expected real returns of each asset class over various periods of time. The weighted average actuarial assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obligations for the periods presented were as follows:

(1)

The compensation increase assumption applies to the international plans and portions of the nonqualified retirement plans, as benefits under these plans were not frozen at

January 2, 2016

,

January 3, 2015

and

December 28, 2013

.

(b) Plan Assets, Expected Benefit Payments, and Funding

The allocation of pension plan assets as of the respective period end measurement dates is as follows:

The Company’s asset strategy and primary investment objective are to maximize the principal value of the plan assets to meet current and future benefit obligations to plan participants and their beneficiaries. To accomplish this goal, the assets of the plan are broadly diversified to protect against large investment losses and to reduce the likelihood of excessive volatility of returns. Diversification of assets is achieved through strategic allocations to various asset classes, as well as various investment styles within these asset classes, and by retaining multiple, third party investment management firms with complementary investment styles and philosophies to implement these allocations. The Company has established a target asset allocation based upon analysis of risk/return tradeoffs and correlations of asset mixes given long-term historical data, prospective capital market returns and forecasted liabilities of the plans. The target asset allocation approximates the actual asset allocation as of

January 2, 2016

. In addition to volatility protection, diversification enables the assets of the plan the best opportunity to provide adequate returns in order to meet the Company’s investment return objectives. These objectives include, over a rolling


-year period, to achieve a total return that exceeds the required actuarial rate of return for the plan and to outperform a passive portfolio, consisting of a similar asset allocation.

(c) Nonretirement Postemployment Benefit Plans

Certain of the international plans, specifically those acquired in connection with the purchase of Hanes Europe Innerwear, are in substance nonretirement postemployment benefit plans, which are future liabilities funded through future operational results of the Company. However, for purposes of consolidation the Company is including these plans within the defined benefit reporting. At

was

$499

and while the total expense

.

(d) Interest Change

Beginning in 2016, the Company will change the method utilized to estimate primarily the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs for the Company’s U.S. defined benefit plans from using a single discount rate as discussed above. The Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the interest component of benefit costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligations to the relevant projected cash flows. The Company will make this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of interest costs. This change will not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in interest costs is completely offset by the actuarial gain or loss reported. The Company will account for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively beginning in 2016.

Income Taxes

The provision for income tax computed by applying the U.S. statutory rate to income before taxes as reconciled to the actual provisions were:

The Company has been granted lower effective income tax rates in two foreign jurisdictions through 2019. These lower rates, when compared with the country’s statutory rates, resulted in an income tax reduction of approximately

(

$0.01

The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the respective year-ends were as follows:

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.

As of

January 2, 2016

, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was

$61,358

, made up of

$47,402

for foreign loss carryforwards,

$1,345

for other foreign deferred tax assets, and

$12,611

for federal and state operating loss carryforwards. The net change in the total valuation allowance for

At

January 2, 2016

, applicable U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be permanently reinvested. If these earnings had not been permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of approximately

$796,000

would have been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized a benefit related to the realization of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations of

$3,587

and

$10,391

, respectively. Although it is not reasonably possible to estimate the amount by which unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next

12 months

due to uncertainties regarding the timing of examinations and the amount of settlements that may be paid, if any, to tax authorities, the Company currently expects a reduction of approximately

$6,100

within the next 12 months.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Unrecognized tax benefits of

$19,780

The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as separate and combined income tax returns in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) began an examination of the Company’s 2011 tax year during the fourth quarter of 2013 and of the Company’s 2012 tax year during the third quarter of 2014, both of which were completed during the third quarter of 2015. As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of

$56,427

due to the remeasurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits. The Company is also currently subject to examination by various state and international tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the outcomes of both ongoing and future examinations for the current or prior years to ensure the Company’s provision for income taxes is sufficient. The Company recognizes liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due and believes its reserves are adequate in relation to any potential assessments. The outcome of any one examination, some of which may conclude during the next 12 months, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Company and certain of the Company’s officers and employees pursuant to the Company’s insider trading policy. During 2015, the Company purchased

12,148

shares of the Company’s common stock at a cost of

$351,495

(average price of

). Since inception of the program, the Company has purchased

23,496

shares of common stock at a cost of

$426,243

(average price of

$18.13

). The primary objective of the share repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution caused by the exercise of options and vesting of restricted stock unit awards, as well as to utilize excess cash to generate shareholder value.

Preferred Stock Purchase Rights

Pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of September 1, 2006 and previously amended on March 26, 2015 (the “Rights Agreement”) between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent, one preferred stock purchase right (a “Right”) was distributed with and attached to each share of the Company’s common stock. Each Right entitled its holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Company’s Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series A (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) at an exercise price of

$75

per right.

On October 27, 2015, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Rights Agreement (the “Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment accelerated the expiration of the Rights from September 1, 2016 to November 10, 2015 and had the effect of terminating the Rights Agreement on November 10, 2015. At the time of the termination of the Rights Agreement, all of the Rights distributed to holders of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Rights Agreement expired. In connection with the termination of the Rights Agreement, on November 10, 2015, the Company eliminated the Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights and reclassified the Series A Preferred Stock as authorized but undesignated shares of the Company’s preferred stock.

Dividends

As part of the Company’s cash deployment strategy, in 2013, the Board of Directors declared the Company’s first dividends of

$0.05

per share on outstanding common stock, which were paid in 2013. Prior to that declaration, the Company had not paid a cash dividend on its common stock.

In 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized regular quarterly dividends of

$0.075

per share, which were paid in 2014.

In January 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend rate to

$0.10

per share on outstanding common stock. During the Company’s 2015 fiscal year, regular quarterly cash dividends of

$0.10

per share were paid on March 3, 2015, June 11, 2015, September 9, 2015 and December 8, 2015.

On March 3, 2015, the Company effected a
