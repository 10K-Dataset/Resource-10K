PART I

Item 1.

Business

OUR
    BUSINESS

General

We are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading
    apparel brands, including

Hanes

,

Champion

,

Playtex

,

Bali

,

Just My Size

,

barely
    there

and

Wonderbra.

We design, manufacture, source
    and sell a broad range of apparel essentials such as t-shirts,
    bras, panties, men’s underwear, kids’ underwear,
    socks, hosiery, casualwear and activewear. Our brands hold
    either the number one or number two U.S. market position by
    sales in most product categories in which we compete.

We were spun off from Sara Lee Corporation on September 5,
    2006. In connection with the spin off, Sara Lee contributed its
    branded apparel Americas and Asia business to us and distributed
    all of the outstanding shares of our common stock to its
    stockholders on a pro rata basis. As a result of the spin off,
    Sara Lee ceased to own any equity interest in our company. In
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we describe the businesses contributed to us by Sara Lee in the
    spin off as if the contributed businesses were our business for
    all historical periods described. References in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

to our historical assets, liabilities, products, businesses or
    activities of our business are generally intended to refer to
    the historical assets, liabilities, products, businesses or
    activities of the contributed businesses as the businesses were
    conducted as part of Sara Lee and its subsidiaries prior to the
    spin off.

Our products are sold through multiple distribution channels. In
    fiscal 2006, 44% of our net sales were to mass merchants, 19%
    were to national chains and department stores, 8% were direct to
    consumer, 8% were in our international segment and 21% were to
    other retail channels such as embellishers, specialty retailers,
    warehouse clubs and sporting goods stores. In addition to
    designing and marketing apparel essentials, we have a long
    history of operating a global supply chain that incorporates a
    mix of self-manufacturing, third-party contractors and
    third-party sourcing.

The apparel essentials segment of the apparel industry is
    characterized by frequently replenished items, such as t-shirts,
    bras, panties, men’s underwear, kids’ underwear, socks
    and hosiery. Growth and sales in the apparel essentials industry
    are not primarily driven by fashion, in contrast to other areas
    of the broader apparel industry. Rather, we focus on the core
    attributes of comfort, fit and value, while remaining current
    with regard to consumer trends.

Our business is organized into four operating segments. These
    segments—innerwear, outerwear, hosiery and
    international—are treated as reportable segments for
    financial reporting purposes.

The following table summarizes our operating segments by
    category:

    this brand in the European Union, or EU, several other European
    countries and South Africa.

Our brands have a strong heritage in the apparel essentials
    industry. According to The NPD Group/Consumer Panel
    Track

sm

,
    or “NPD,” our brands possess either the number one or
    number two market position in the United States in most of the
    product categories in which we compete, on a rolling year-end
    basis as of May 2006. According to a 2006 survey of consumer
    brand awareness by Women’s Wear Daily,

Hanes

is the
    most recognized apparel and accessory brand among women in the
    United States. According to NPD, our largest brand,

Hanes

, is the top selling apparel brand in the United
    States by units sold, on a rolling year-end basis as of May 2006.

We sell high-volume, frequently replenished apparel essentials.
    The majority of our core styles continue from year to year, with
    variations only in color, fabric or design details, and are
    frequently replenished by consumers. For example, we believe the
    average U.S. consumer makes 3.5 trips to retailers to
    purchase men’s underwear and 4.5 trips to purchase panties
    annually.

We are the largest seller of apparel essentials in the United
    States as measured by sales. As an example of the scale of our
    operations, we manufactured and sold more than 400 million
    t-shirts (innerwear and outerwear) and almost half a billion
    pairs of socks in fiscal 2006. Most of our products are sold to
    large retailers that have high-volume demands. We have met the
    demands of our customers by developing vertically integrated
    operations and an extensive network of owned facilities and
    third-party manufacturers over a broad geographic footprint.

We sell our products primarily through large, high-volume
    retailers, including mass merchants, department stores and
    national chains. We have strong, long-term relationships with
    our top customers, including relationships of more than ten
    years with each of our top ten customers. The size and
    operational scale of the high-volume retailers with which we do
    business require extensive category and product knowledge and
    specialized services regarding the quantity, quality and
    planning of orders. In the late 1980s, we undertook a shift in
    our approach to our relationships with our largest customers
    when we sought to align significant parts of our organization
    with corresponding parts of their organizations. For example, we
    are organized into teams that sell to and service our customers
    across a range of functional areas, such as demand planning,
    replenishment and logistics. We also have entered into
    customer-specific programs such as the introduction in 2004 of

C9 by Champion

products marketed and sold through Target
    stores. Through these efforts, we have become the largest
    apparel essentials supplier to many of our customers.

Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry
    trends will continue to be key to our success. Our design,
    research and product development teams, in partnership with our
    marketing teams, drive our efforts to bring innovations to
    market. We intend to leverage our insights into consumer demand
    in the apparel essentials industry to develop new products
    within our existing lines and to modify our existing core
    products in ways that make them more appealing, addressing
    changing customer needs and industry trends.

Examples of our success to date include:

•

Tagless garments—where the label is embroidered or printed
    directly on the garment instead of attached on a tag—which
    we first released in t-shirts under our

Hanes

brand
    (2002), and subsequently expanded into other products such as
    outerwear tops (2003) and panties (2004).

•

“Comfort Soft” bands in our underwear and bra lines,
    which deliver to our consumers a softer, more comfortable feel
    with the same durable fit (2004 and 2005).

•

New versions of our Double Dry wicking products and Friction
    Free running products under our

Champion

brand (2005).

•

The “no poke” wire which was successfully introduced
    to the market in our

Bali

brand bras (2004).

Our
    Industry

According to industry estimates from NPD, apparel sales in the
    United States totaled approximately $181 billion in
    calendar year 2005, growing at a compound annual rate of 3.5%
    from calendar year 2003 to calendar year 2005, driven largely by
    strength in adult apparel sales. The apparel essentials segment
    of the apparel industry is characterized by frequently
    replenished items, such as t-shirts, bras, panties, men’s



underwear, kids’ underwear, socks and hosiery, which
    represented approximately 24%, or $44 billion, of total
    calendar year 2005 apparel sales. Apparel essentials sales have
    been growing faster than the total apparel market, with apparel
    essentials growing at a compound annual rate of 4.5% over the
    past two calendar years. The overall U.S. apparel market
    and the core categories critical to our future success will
    continue to be influenced by a number of broad-based trends:

•

the U.S. population is predicted to increase at a rate of
    less than 1% annually, with the rate of increase declining
    through 2050, with a continued aging of the population and a
    shift in the ethnic mix;

•

changing attitudes about fashion, the need for versatility, and
    continuing preferences for more casual apparel are expected to
    support the strength of basic or classic styles of “relaxed
    apparel”;

•

the impact of a continued deflationary environment in our
    business and the apparel essentials industry;

•

continued increases in body size across all age groups and
    genders, and especially among children, will drive demand for
    plus-sized apparel; and

•

intense competition and continued consolidation in the retail
    industry, the shifting of formats among major retailers,
    convenience and value will continue to be key drivers.

In addition, we anticipate growth in the apparel essentials
    industry will be driven in part by product improvements and
    innovations. Improvements in product features, such as stretch
    in t-shirts or tagless garment labels, or in increased variety
    through new sizes or styles, such as half sizes and boy leg
    briefs, are expected to enhance consumer appeal and category
    demand. Often the innovations and improvements in our industry
    are not trend-driven, but are designed to react to identifiable
    consumer needs and demands. As a consequence, the apparel
    essentials market is characterized by lower fashion risks
    compared to other apparel categories.

Our
    Brands

Our portfolio of leading brands is designed to address the needs
    and wants of various consumer segments across a broad range of
    apparel essentials products. Our portfolio includes four brands
    that each have fiscal 2006 annual net sales significantly in
    excess of $200.0 million, with

Hanes

fiscal
    2006 net sales exceeding $2.0 billion. Each of our
    brands has a particular consumer positioning that distinguishes
    it from its competitors and guides its advertising and product
    development.

Hanes

is the largest and most widely recognized brand in
    our portfolio. According to a 2006 survey of consumer brand
    awareness by Women’s Wear Daily,

Hanes

is the most
    recognized apparel and accessory brand among women in the United
    States. The

Hanes

brand covers all of our product
    categories, including men’s underwear, kids’
    underwear, bras, panties, socks, t-shirts, fleece and sheer
    hosiery.

Hanes

stands for outstanding comfort, style and
    value.

Champion

is our second-largest brand. Specializing in
    athletic performance apparel, the

Champion

brand is
    designed for everyday athletes. We believe that

Champion

’s combination of comfort, fit and style
    provides athletes with mobility, durability and

up-to-date

styles, all product qualities that are important in the sale of
    athletic products. We also distribute products under the

C9
    by Champion

brand exclusively through Target stores.

Playtex

, our third-largest brand within our portfolio,
    offers a line of bras, panties and shapewear, including products
    that offer solutions for hard to fit figures.

Bali

is the
    fourth-largest brand within our portfolio.

Bali

offers a
    range of bras, panties and shapewear sold in the department
    store channel. Our brand portfolio also includes the following
    well-known brands:

L’eggs, Just My Size, barely there,
    Wonderbra, Outerbanks, and Duofold.

These brands serve to
    round out our product offerings, allowing us to give consumers a
    variety of options to meet their diverse needs.

Our
    Segments

Our operations are managed in four operating segments, each of
    which is a reportable segment: innerwear, outerwear, hosiery and
    international. Our innerwear, outerwear and hosiery segments
    principally sell products in the United States and our
    international segment exclusively sells products in foreign
    countries.



For more information about our segments, see Note 21 to the
    combined and consolidated financial statements included in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Innerwear

The innerwear segment focuses on core apparel essentials, and
    consists of products such as women’s intimate apparel,
    men’s underwear, kids’ underwear, socks, thermals and
    sleepwear, marketed under well-known brands that are trusted by
    consumers. We are an intimate apparel category leader in the
    United States with our

Hanes, Playtex, Bali, barely there,
    Just My Size

and

Wonderbra

brands, offering a full
    line of bras, panties and bodywear. We are also a leading
    manufacturer and marketer of men’s underwear and kids’
    underwear under the

Hanes

and

Champion

brand
    names. We also produce underwear products under a licensing
    agreement with Polo Ralph Lauren. Our fiscal 2006 net sales
    from our innerwear segment were $2.6 billion, representing
    approximately 58% of net sales.

Outerwear

We are a leader in the casualwear and activewear markets through
    our

Hanes, Champion

and

Just My Size

brands, where
    we offer products such as t-shirts and fleece. Our casualwear
    lines offer a range of quality, comfortable clothing for men,
    women and children marketed under the

Hanes

and

Just
    My Size

brands. The

Just My Size

brand offers casual
    apparel designed exclusively to meet the needs of plus-size
    women. In addition to activewear for men and women,

Champion

provides uniforms for athletic programs and in 2004 launched
    a new apparel program at Target,

C9 by Champion.

We also
    license our

Champion

name for collegiate apparel and
    footwear. We also supply our t-shirts, sportshirts and fleece
    products to screenprinters and embellishers, who imprint or
    embroider the product and then resell to specialty retailers and
    organizations such as resorts and professional sports clubs. We
    sell our products to screenprinters and embellishers primarily
    under the

Hanes, Hanes Beefy-T

and

Outer Banks

brands. Our fiscal 2006 net sales from our outerwear
    segment were $1.2 billion, representing approximately 27%
    of net sales.

Hosiery

We are the leading marketer of women’s sheer hosiery in the
    United States. We compete in the hosiery market by striving to
    offer superior values and executing integrated marketing
    activities, as well as focusing on the style of our hosiery
    products. We market hosiery products under our

Hanes,
    L’eggs

and

Just My Size

brands. Our fiscal
    2006 net sales from our hosiery segment were
    $305.7 million, representing approximately 7% of net sales.
    Consistent with a sustained decline in the hosiery industry due
    to changes in consumer preferences, our net sales from hosiery
    sales have declined each year since 1995.

International

Our fiscal 2006 net sales in our international segment were
    $388.0 million, representing approximately 8% of net
    sales and included sales in Asia, Canada and Latin America.
    Japan, Canada and Mexico are our largest international markets
    and we also have opened sales offices in India and China.

Design,
    Research and Product Development

At the core of our design, research and product development
    capabilities is a team of more than 300 professionals. As
    part of plans to consolidate our operations, we recently
    combined our design, research and development teams into an
    integrated group for all of our product categories. We also
    recently opened a new facility located in Winston-Salem, North
    Carolina, which is the center of our research, technical design
    and product development efforts. We employ creative design and
    product development personnel in our design center in New York
    City and have a research team in the United Kingdom. Consistent
    with the expansion of our manufacturing operations, we are
    planning to expand our research and product development
    activities into Asia. During fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, we
    spent approximately $53 million, $51 million, and
    $55 million, respectively, on design, research and product
    development.



Customers

In fiscal 2006, approximately 92% of our net sales were to
    customers in the United States and approximately 8% were to
    customers outside the United States (consisting of net sales
    from our international segment and net sales from our outerwear
    segment to customers outside the United States). Domestically,
    almost 81% of our net sales were wholesale sales to retailers,
    11% were wholesale sales to third-party embellishers and 8% were

direct-to-consumer.

We have well-established relationships with some of the largest
    apparel retailers in the world. Our largest customers are
    Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl’s, accounting for 29%, 12% and 6%
    of our total sales in fiscal 2006, respectively. As is common in
    the apparel essentials industry, we generally do not have
    purchase agreements that obligate our customers, including
    Wal-Mart, to purchase our products. However, all of our key
    customer relationships have been in place for 10 years or
    more. Wal-Mart and Target are our only customers with net sales
    that exceed 10% of any individual segment’s net sales. In
    our innerwear segment, Wal-Mart accounts for 34% of net sales
    and Target accounts for 11% of net sales. In our outerwear
    segment, Wal-Mart accounts for 23% of net sales and Target
    accounts for 19% of net sales. In our hosiery and international
    segments, Wal-Mart accounts for 21% and 13% of net sales,
    respectively. Across all of our distribution channels, our
    largest customers are also among the largest participants in
    their respective channels. For example, in fiscal 2006 our sales
    to Wal-Mart exceeded $1.2 billion.

Due to their size and operational scale, high-volume retailers
    require extensive category and product knowledge and specialized
    services regarding the quantity, quality and timing of product
    orders. We have organized multi-functional customer management
    teams, which has allowed us to form strategic long-term
    relationships with these customers and efficiently focus
    resources on category, product and service expertise. Smaller
    regional customers attracted to our leading brands and quality
    products also represent an important component of our
    distribution, and our organizational model provides for an
    efficient use of resources that delivers a high level of
    category and channel expertise and services to these customers.
    In the United States, we sell our products through all
    distribution channels in which apparel essentials are sold.

Sales to the mass merchant channel accounted for approximately
    44% of our net sales in fiscal 2006. We sell all of our product
    categories in this channel primarily under our

Hanes, Just My
    Size, Playtex

and

C9 by Champion

brands.
    Mass merchants feature high-volume, low-cost sales of basic
    apparel items along with a diverse variety of consumer goods
    products, such as grocery and drug products and other hard
    lines, and are characterized by large retailers, such as
    Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, which accounted for approximately 29% of our
    total net sales for fiscal 2006, is our largest mass merchant
    customer.

Sales to the national chains and department stores channel
    accounted for approximately 19% of our net sales in fiscal 2006.
    The national chains target a higher-income consumer than mass
    merchants, focus more of their sales on apparel items rather
    than other consumer goods such as grocery and drug products, and
    are characterized by large retailers such as Sears, JC Penney
    and Kohl’s. We sell all of our product categories in this
    channel. Traditional department stores target higher-income
    consumers and carry more high-end, fashion conscious products
    than national chains or mass merchants and tend to operate in
    higher-income areas and commercial centers. Traditional
    department stores are characterized by large retailers such as
    Macy’s and Dillard’s. We sell products in our intimate
    apparel, hosiery and underwear categories through these
    department stores.

Sales to the

direct-to-consumer

channel accounted for approximately 8% of our net sales in
    fiscal 2006. We sell our branded products directly to consumers
    through our 224 outlet stores, as well as our catalogs and our
    web sites operating under the

Hanes

name, as well as

One Hanes Place, Outerbanks, Just My Size

and

Champion.

Our outlet stores are value based, offering the
    consumer a savings of 25% to 40% off suggested retail prices,
    and sell first-quality, excess, post-season, obsolete and
    slightly imperfect products. Our catalogs and web sites address
    the growing

direct-to-consumer

channel that operates in today’s 24/7 retail environment,
    and we have an active database of approximately two million
    consumers receiving our catalogs and emails. Our web sites have
    experienced significant growth, and we expect this trend to
    continue as more consumers embrace this retail shopping channel.

Sales in our international segment represented approximately 8%
    of our net sales in fiscal 2006, and included sales in Asia,
    Canada and Latin America. Japan, Canada and Mexico are our
    largest international



markets, and India and China are the fastest growing. We operate
    in several locations in Latin America including Mexico, Puerto
    Rico, Argentina, Brazil and Central America. From an export
    business perspective, we use distributors to service customers
    in the Middle East and Asia, and have a limited presence in
    Latin America. The primary focus of the export business is

Hanes

underwear and

Bali, Playtex, Wonderbra

and

barely there

intimate apparel.

Sales in other channels represented approximately 21% of our net
    sales in fiscal 2006. We sell t-shirts, golf and sport shirts
    and fleece sweatshirts to third-party embellishers primarily
    under our

Hanes

,

Hanes Beefy-T

and

Outerbanks

brands. Sales to third-party embellishers accounted for
    approximately 11% of our net sales in fiscal 2006. We also sell
    a significant range of our underwear, activewear and sock
    products under the

Champion

brand to wholesale clubs,
    such as Costco, and sporting goods stores, such as The Sports
    Authority. We sell primarily legwear and underwear products
    under the

Hanes

and

L’eggs

brands to food,
    drug and variety stores. We sell our branded apparel essentials
    products to the U.S. military for sale to servicemen and
    servicewomen.

Inventory

Effective inventory management is a key component of our future
    success. Since our customers do not purchase our products under
    long-term supply contracts, but rather on a purchase order
    basis, effective inventory management requires close
    coordination with the customer base. We employ various types of
    inventory management techniques that include collaborative
    forecasting and planning, vendor managed inventory, key event
    management, and various forms of replenishment management
    processes. We have approximately 69 demand management planners
    in our customer management group who work closely with customers
    to develop demand forecasts that are passed to the supply chain.
    We have an additional 18 professionals within the customer
    management group who coordinate daily with our larger customers
    to help ensure that our customers’ planned inventory levels
    are in fact available at their individual retail outlets.
    Additionally, within our supply chain organization we have
    approximately 150 dedicated professionals that translate the
    demand forecast into our inventory strategy and specific
    production plans. These individuals work closely with our
    customer management team to balance inventory
    investment/exposure with customer service targets.

Seasonality

Generally, our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate
    the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items.
    Nevertheless, we are subject to some degree of seasonality.
    Sales are typically higher in the first two quarters (July to
    December) of each fiscal year. Socks, hosiery and fleece
    products generally have higher sales during this period as a
    result of cooler weather,

back-to-school

shopping and holidays. Sales levels in a period are also
    impacted by customers’ decisions to increase or decrease
    their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer
    demand.

Marketing

Our strategy is to bring consumer-driven innovation to market in
    a compelling way. Our approach is to build targeted, effective
    multi-media advertising and marketing campaigns regarding our
    portfolio of key brands. In addition, we will explore new
    marketing opportunities through which we can communicate the key
    features and benefits of our brands to consumers. For example,
    in fiscal 2005, we launched a comprehensive marketing campaign
    titled “Look Who We’ve Got Our Hanes on Now,”
    which we believe significantly increased positive consumer
    attitudes about the

Hanes

brand in the areas of
    stylishness, distinctiveness and

up-to-date

products. We believe that the strength of our consumer insights,
    our distinctive brand propositions and our focus on integrated
    marketing give us a competitive advantage in the fragmented
    apparel marketplace.

Distribution

We distribute our products for the U.S. market primarily
    from

U.S.-based

company-owned and company-operated distribution centers. As of
    July 1, 2006, we operated 31 distribution centers and also
    performed direct



ship services from selected Central America, Caribbean Basin and
    Mexico based operations to the U.S. markets. We recently
    opened our first distribution center on the West Coast, in
    California. International distribution operations use a
    combination of third-party logistics providers, as well as owned
    and operated distribution operations, to distribute goods to our
    various international markets. We are currently in the process
    of consolidating several of our U.S. distribution centers.
    In this process, we intend to centralize our distribution
    centers around our Winston-Salem, North Carolina base and close
    several of our distribution centers located around the United
    States.

Manufacturing
    and Sourcing

In fiscal 2006, approximately 80% of our finished goods sold in
    the United States were manufactured through a combination of
    facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and operated
    by third-party contractors. These contractors perform some of
    the steps in the manufacturing process for us, such as cutting

and/or

sewing. We sourced the remainder of our finished goods from
    third-party manufacturers who supply us with finished products
    based on our designs. We believe that our balanced approach to
    product supply, which relies on a combination of owned,
    contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different
    geographic regions, increases the efficiency of our operations,
    reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of
    supply.

Finished
    Goods That Are Manufactured by Hanesbrands

The manufacturing process for finished goods that we manufacture
    begins with raw materials we obtain from third parties. The
    principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and
    synthetics. Our costs for cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles
    vary based upon the fluctuating and volatile cost of cotton,
    which is affected by weather, consumer demand, speculation on
    the commodities market and the relative valuations and
    fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer
    countries. We attempt to mitigate the effect of fluctuating raw
    material costs by entering into short-term supply agreements
    that set the price we will pay for cotton yarn and cotton-based
    textiles in future periods. We also enter into hedging contracts
    on cotton designed to protect us from severe market fluctuations
    in the wholesale prices of cotton. In addition to cotton yarn
    and cotton-based textiles, we use thread and trim for product
    identification, buttons, zippers, snaps and lace.

Fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices also may influence
    the prices of items used in our business, such as chemicals,
    dyestuffs, polyester yarn and foam. Alternate sources of these
    materials and services are readily available. After they are
    sourced, cotton and synthetic materials are spun into yarn,
    which is then knitted into cotton, synthetic and blended
    fabrics. We spin a significant portion of the yarn and knit a
    significant portion of the fabrics we use in our owned and
    operated facilities. To a lesser extent, we purchase fabric from
    several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with
    scheduled production. These fabrics are cut and sewn into
    finished products, either by us or by third-party contractors.
    Most of our cutting and sewing operations are located in Central
    America and the Caribbean Basin.

In making decisions about the location of manufacturing
    operations and third-party sources of supply, we consider a
    number of factors including local labor costs, quality of
    production, applicable quotas and duties and freight costs.
    Although, according to a 2005 study, approximately 80% of our
    workforce in fiscal 2005 was located outside the United States,
    approximately 70% of our labor costs in fiscal 2005 were related
    to our domestic workforce. We continue to evaluate actions to
    reduce our U.S. workforce over time, which should have the
    effect of reducing our total labor costs. Over the past ten
    years, we have engaged in a substantial asset relocation
    strategy designed to relocate or eliminate portions of our
    U.S. based manufacturing operations to lower-cost locations
    in Central America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia. In this
    regard, we have recently launched two textile manufacturing
    projects outside of the United States—an owned textile
    manufacturing facility in the Dominican Republic, which began
    production in early 2006, and a strategic alliance with a
    third-party textile manufacturer in El Salvador, which began
    production in 2005. At these facilities, textiles are knit,
    dyed, finished and cut in accordance with our specifications. We
    expect to achieve cost efficiencies from our operations at these
    facilities primarily as a result of lower labor costs. In
    addition, because these manufacturing facilities are located in
    close proximity to the sewing operations to which the
    manufactured textiles must be transported, we expect to achieve
    additional efficiencies by reducing the amount of time



needed to produce finished goods. We also expect to increase
    asset utilization through the operations at these facilities. In
    connection with moving operations from other facilities, we
    reduced excess manufacturing capacity. We also expect to benefit
    from locating many of the processes that require constant
    changes to the manufacturing line at a single facility, which
    allows for fewer changes at other facilities. We closed two of
    our owned textile facilities in the United States in connection
    with these projects. We also recently closed two additional
    facilities in the United States and one in Mexico.

Finished
    Goods That Are Manufactured by Third Parties

In addition to our manufacturing capabilities, we also source
    finished goods designed by us from

third-party

manufacturers, also referred to as “turnkey products.”
    Many of these turnkey products are sourced from international
    suppliers by our strategic sourcing hubs in Hong Kong and other
    locations in Asia.

All contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high
    quality standards. Further, all contractors and third-party
    manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict
    supplier and business practices guidelines. These requirements
    provide strict standards covering hours of work, age of workers,
    health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws.
    Each new supplier must be inspected and agree to comprehensive
    compliance terms prior to performance of any production on our
    behalf. We audit compliance with these standards and maintain
    strict compliance performance records. In addition to our audit
    procedures, we require certain of our suppliers to be Worldwide
    Responsible Apparel Production, or “WRAP,” certified.
    WRAP is a stringent apparel certification program that
    independently monitors and certifies compliance with certain
    specified manufacturing standards that are intended to ensure
    that a given factory produces sewn goods under lawful, humane
    and ethical conditions. WRAP uses third-party, independent
    certification firms, and requires

factory-by-factory

certification.

Trade
    Regulation

We are exposed to certain risks of doing business outside of the
    United States. We import goods from company-owned facilities in
    Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean Basin, and from
    suppliers in those areas and in Asia, Europe, Africa and the
    Middle East. These import transactions had been subject to
    constraints imposed by bilateral agreements that imposed quotas
    that limited the amount of certain categories of merchandise
    from certain countries that could be imported into the United
    States and the EU.

Pursuant to a 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing under the
    World Trade Organization, or “WTO,” effective
    January 1, 2005, the United States and other WTO member
    countries were required, with few exceptions, to remove quotas
    on goods from WTO member countries. The complete removal of
    quotas would benefit us, as well as other apparel companies, by
    allowing us to source products without quantitative limitation
    from any country. Several countries, including the United
    States, have imposed safeguard quotas on China pursuant to the
    terms of China’s Accession Agreement to the WTO, and others
    may impose similar restrictions in the future. Our management
    evaluates the possible impact of these and similar actions on
    our ability to import products from China. We do not expect the
    imposition of these safeguards to have a material impact on us.

Our management monitors new developments and risks relating to
    duties, tariffs and quotas. In response to the changing import
    environment resulting from the elimination of quotas, management
    has chosen to continue its balanced approach to manufacturing
    and sourcing. We attempt to limit our sourcing exposure through
    geographic diversification with a mix of company-owned and
    contracted production, as well as shifts of production among
    countries and contractors. We will continue to manage our supply
    chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes
    in the global production environment.

Competition

The apparel essentials market is highly competitive and rapidly
    evolving. Competition generally is based upon price, brand name
    recognition, product quality, selection, service and purchasing
    convenience. Our businesses face competition today from other
    large corporations and foreign manufacturers. These competitors
    include Fruit of the Loom, Inc., Warnaco Group Inc., VF
    Corporation and Maidenform Brands, Inc. in our



innerwear business segment and Gildan Activewear, Inc., Russell
    Corporation and Fruit of the Loom, Inc. in our outerwear
    business segment. We also compete with many small manufacturers
    across all of our business segments. Additionally, department
    stores and other retailers, including many of our customers,
    market and sell apparel essentials products under private labels
    that compete directly with our brands. We also face intense
    competition from specialty stores who sell private label apparel
    not manufactured by us such as Victoria’s Secret, Old Navy
    and The Gap.

Our competitive strengths include our strong brands with leading
    market positions, our high-volume, core essentials focus, our
    significant scale of operations and our strong customer
    relationships.

•

Strong Brands with Leading Market Positions.

According to
    NPD, our brands possess either the number one or number two
    market position in the United States in most of the product
    categories in which we compete, on a rolling year-end basis.
    According to NPD, our largest brand,

Hanes

, is the top
    selling apparel brand in the United States by units sold, on a
    rolling year-end basis.

•

High-Volume, Core Essentials Focus.

We sell high-volume,
    frequently replenished apparel essentials. The majority of our
    core styles continue from year to year, with variations only in
    color, fabric or design details, and are frequently replenished
    by consumers. We believe that our status as a high-volume seller
    of core apparel essentials creates a more stable and predictable
    revenue base and reduces our exposure to dramatic fashion shifts
    often observed in the general apparel industry.

•

Significant Scale of Operations.

We are the largest
    seller of apparel essentials in the United States as measured by
    sales. As an example of the scale of our operations, we
    manufactured and sold more than 400 million t-shirts
    (innerwear and outerwear) and almost half a billion pairs of
    socks in fiscal 2006. Most of our products are sold to large
    retailers which have high-volume demands. We believe that we are
    able to leverage our significant scale of operations to provide
    us with greater manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing power and
    product design, marketing and customer management resources than
    our smaller competitors.

•

Strong Customer Relationships.

We sell our products
    primarily through large, high-volume retailers, including mass
    merchants, department stores and national chains. We have
    strong, long-term relationships with our top customers,
    including relationships of over ten years with each of our top
    ten customers. In the late 1980s, we undertook a shift in our
    approach to our relationships with our largest customers when we
    sought to align significant parts of our organization with
    corresponding parts of their organizations. We also have entered
    into customer-specific programs such as the introduction in 2004
    of

C9 by Champion

products marketed and sold through
    Target stores. Through these efforts, we have become the largest
    apparel essentials supplier to many of our customers.

Intellectual
    Property

Overview

We market our products under hundreds of trademarks, service
    marks, and trade names in the United States and other
    countries around the world, the most widely recognized being

Hanes, Playtex, Bali, barely there, Wonderbra, Just My Size,
    L’eggs, Champion, C9 by Champion, Duofold, Beefy-T, Outer
    Banks, Sol y Oro, Rinbros, Zorba

and

Ritmo.

Some of
    our products are sold under trademarks that have been licensed
    from third parties, such as Polo Ralph Lauren men’s
    underwear, and we also hold licenses from various toy and media
    companies which give us the right to use certain of their
    proprietary characters, names and trademarks.

Some of our own trademarks are licensed to third parties for
    non-core product categories, such as

Champion

for
    athletic-oriented accessories. In the United States, the

Playtex

trademark is owned by Playtex Marketing
    Corporation, of which we own a 50% share and which grants to us
    a perpetual license to the

Playtex

trademark on and in
    connection with the sale of apparel in the United States and
    Canada. The other 50% share of Playtex Marketing Corporation is
    owned by Playtex Products, Inc., an unrelated third-party, which
    has a perpetual license to the

Playtex

trademark on and
    in connection with the sale of non-apparel products in the
    United States. Outside the United States and Canada, we own the

Playtex

trademark and



perpetually license such trademark to Playtex Products, Inc. for
    non-apparel products. In addition, as described below, as part
    of Sara Lee’s sale in February 2006 of its European branded
    apparel business, Sun Capital has an exclusive, perpetual,
    royalty-free license to sell and distribute apparel products
    under the

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

trademarks in the
    member states of the EU, as well as several other European
    nations and South Africa. We also own a number of copyrights.
    Our trademarks and copyrights are important to our marketing
    efforts and have substantial value. We aggressively protect
    these trademarks and copyrights from infringement and dilution
    through appropriate measures, including court actions and
    administrative proceedings.

Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally
    remain valid as long as they are in use

and/or

their
    registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to
    have become generic. Most of the trademarks in our portfolio,
    including all of our core brands, are covered by trademark
    registrations in the countries of the world in which we do
    business, with registration periods ranging between seven and
    20 years depending on the country. Trademark registrations
    generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks
    are in use. We have an active program designed to ensure that
    our trademarks are registered, renewed, protected and
    maintained. We plan to continue to use all of our core
    trademarks and plan to renew the registrations for such
    trademarks for as long as we continue to use them. Most of our
    copyrights are unregistered, although we have a sizable
    portfolio of copyrighted lace designs that are the subject of a
    number of registrations at the U.S. Copyright Office.

We place high importance on product innovation and design, and a
    number of these innovations and designs are the subject of
    patents. However, we do not regard any segment of our business
    as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related
    patents. In addition, we own proprietary trade secrets,
    technology and know-how that we have not patented.

Shared
    Trademark Relationship with Sun Capital

In February 2006, Sara Lee sold its European branded apparel
    business to an affiliate of Sun Capital. In connection with the
    sale, Sun Capital received an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free
    license to sell and distribute apparel products under the

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

trademarks in the member
    states of the EU, as well as Belarus, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
    Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Morocco, Norway, Romania,
    Russia, Serbia-Montenegro, South Africa, Switzerland, Ukraine,
    Andorra, Albania, Channel Islands, Lichtenstein, Monaco,
    Gibraltar, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion and French Guyana
    (the “Covered Nations”). We are not permitted to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded products in these
    nations and without our agreement Sun Capital is not permitted
    to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded products
    outside of these nations. In connection with the sale, we also
    have received an exclusive, perpetual royalty-free license to
    sell DIM and UNNO branded products in Panama, Honduras, El
    Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Belize, Guatemala, Mexico,
    Puerto Rico, the United States, Canada and, for DIM products,
    Japan. We are not permitted to sell DIM or UNNO branded apparel
    products outside of these countries and Sun Capital will not be
    permitted to sell DIM or UNNO branded apparel products inside
    these countries. We also are not permitted to distribute or sell
    certain apparel products, not including

Hanes

products,
    in the Covered Nations until February 2007. In addition, the
    rights to certain European-originated brands previously part of
    Sara Lee’s branded apparel portfolio were transferred to
    Sun Capital, and are not included in our brand portfolio.

Licensing
    Relationship with Tupperware Corporation

In December 2005, Sara Lee sold its direct selling business,
    which markets cosmetics, skin care products, toiletries and
    clothing in 18 countries, to Tupperware Corporation. In
    connection with the sale, Dart Industries Inc., or
    “Dart,” an affiliate of Tupperware, received a
    three-year exclusive license agreement to use the

C Logo, Champion U.S.A., Wonderbra, W by Wonderbra, The
    One and Only Wonderbra, Playtex, Just My Size

and

Hanes

trademarks for the manufacture and sale, under the
    applicable brands, of certain men’s and women’s
    apparel in the Philippines, including underwear, socks,
    sportswear products, bras, panties and girdles, and for the
    exhaustion of similar product inventory in Malaysia. Dart also
    received a ten-year, royalty-free, exclusive license to use the

Girl’s Attitudes

and

Girls’ Attitudes

trademarks for the manufacture and sale of certain
    toiletries, cosmetics, intimate apparel, underwear, sportswear,
    watches, bags and towels in the Philippines. The rights and
    obligations under these agreements were assigned to us as a part
    of the spin off. These license



agreements are not yet effective pending the closing of the sale
    of the direct selling business in the Philippines.

In connection with the sale of Sara Lee’s direct selling
    business, Tupperware Corporation also signed two five-year
    distributorship agreements providing Tupperware with the
    exclusive right for three years to distribute and sell, through

door-to-door

and similar channels,

Playtex, Champion, Rinbros, Aire,
    Wonderbra, Hanes

and

Teens by Hanes

apparel items in
    Mexico that we have discontinued

and/or

determined to be obsolete. The agreements also provide
    Tupperware with the exclusive right for five years to distribute
    and sell through such channels such apparel items sold by us in
    the ordinary course of business. The agreements also grant a
    limited right to use such trademarks solely in connection with
    the distribution and sale of those products in Mexico.

Under the terms of the agreements, we reserve the right to apply
    for, prosecute and maintain trademark registrations in Mexico
    for those products covered by the distributorship agreement. The
    rights and obligations under these agreements were assigned to
    us as part of the spin off.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws
    and regulations that govern our activities, operations and
    products that may have adverse environmental, health and safety
    effects, including laws and regulations relating to generating
    emissions, water discharges, waste, product and packaging
    content and workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and
    regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and
    criminal sanctions. We are aware of hazardous substances or
    petroleum releases at a few of our facilities and are working
    with the relevant environmental authorities to investigate and
    address such releases. We also have been identified as a
    “potentially responsible party” at a few waste
    disposal sites undergoing investigation and cleanup under the
    federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act (commonly known as Superfund) or state Superfund
    equivalent programs. Where we have determined that a liability
    has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be
    estimated, we have accrued amounts in our balance sheet for
    losses related to these sites. Compliance with environmental
    laws and regulations and our remedial environmental obligations
    historically have not had a material impact on our operations,
    and we are not aware of any proposed regulations or remedial
    obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital
    expenditures in order to comply.

Government
    Regulation

We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and
    regulations that could affect our business, including those
    promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the
    Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the
    Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and
    regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and
    various environmental laws and regulations. Our international
    businesses are subject to similar laws and regulations in the
    countries in which they operate. Our operations also are subject
    to various international trade agreements and regulations. See
    “Trade Regulation” above. While we believe that we are
    in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
    governmental regulations, current governmental regulations may
    change or become more stringent or unforeseen events may occur,
    any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial position or results of operations.

Employees

As of July 1, 2006, we had approximately 49,000 employees,
    approximately 14,000 of whom were located in the United States.
    As of July 1, 2006, in the United States, fewer than 110
    employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A
    portion of our international employees were also covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relationships
    with our employees are good.



Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

RISK
    FACTORS

This section describes circumstances or events that could have a
    negative effect on our financial results or operations or that
    could change, for the worse, existing trends in our businesses.
    The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events
    described below could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or on
    the trading prices of our common stock. The risks and
    uncertainties described in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and
    uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we
    currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our
    businesses and operations.

Risks
    Related to Our Business

A
    significant portion of our textile manufacturing operations are
    located in higher-cost locations, placing us at a product cost
    disadvantage to our competitors who have a higher percentage of
    their manufacturing operations in lower-cost, offshore
    locations.

Though there has been a general industrywide migration of
    manufacturing operations to lower-cost locations, such as
    Central America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia, a significant
    portion of our textile manufacturing operations are still
    located in higher-cost locations, such as the United States. In
    addition, our competitors generally source or produce a greater
    portion of their textiles from regions with lower costs than us,
    placing us at a cost disadvantage. Our competitors are able to
    exert pricing pressure on us by using their manufacturing cost
    savings to reduce prices of their products, while maintaining
    higher margins than us. To remain competitive, we must, among
    other things, react to these pricing pressures by lowering our
    prices from time to time. We will continue to experience pricing
    pressure and remain at a cost disadvantage to our competitors
    unless we are able to successfully migrate a greater portion of
    our textile manufacturing operations to lower-cost locations.
    However, we cannot guarantee that our migration plans, as
    executed, will relieve these pricing pressures and our cost
    disadvantage.

We are in
    the process of relocating a significant portion of our textile
    manufacturing operations to overseas locations and this process
    involves significant costs and the risk of operational
    interruption.

We currently are relocating and expect to continue to relocate a
    significant portion of our textile manufacturing operations to
    locations in Central America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia. The
    process of relocating significant portions of our textile
    manufacturing and production operations has resulted in and will
    continue to result in significant costs. This process also may
    result in operational interruptions, which may have an adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

The
    integration of our information technology systems is complex,
    and any delay or problem with this integration may cause serious
    disruption or harm to our business.

As part of our efforts to consolidate our operations, we are in
    the process of integrating currently unrelated information
    technology systems across our company which have resulted in
    operational inefficiencies and in some cases increased our
    costs. This process involves the replacement of eight
    independent systems environments running on different technology
    platforms with a unified enterprise system that will integrate
    all of our departments and functions onto common software that
    runs off a single database. We are subject to the risk that we
    will not able to absorb the level of systems change, commit the
    necessary resources or focus the management attention necessary
    for the implementation to succeed. Many key strategic
    initiatives of major business functions, such as our supply
    chain and our finance operations, depend on advanced
    capabilities enabled by the new systems and if we fail to
    properly execute or if we miss critical deadlines in the
    implementation of this initiative, we could experience serious
    disruption and harm to our business.



We
    operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and
    our market share and results of operations could be adversely
    affected if we fail to compete effectively in the
    future.

The apparel essentials market is highly competitive and evolving
    rapidly. Competition is generally based upon price, brand name
    recognition, product quality, selection, service and purchasing
    convenience. Our businesses face competition today from other
    large corporations and foreign manufacturers. These competitors
    include Fruit of the Loom, Inc., Warnaco Group Inc., VF
    Corporation and Maidenform Brands, Inc. in our innerwear
    business segment and Gildan Activewear, Inc., Russell
    Corporation and Fruit of the Loom, Inc. in our outerwear
    business segment. We also compete with many small companies
    across all of our business segments. Additionally, department
    stores and other retailers, including many of our customers,
    market and sell apparel essentials products under private labels
    that compete directly with our brands. These customers may buy
    goods that are manufactured by others, which represents a lost
    business opportunity for us, or they may sell private label
    products manufactured by us, which have significantly lower
    gross margins than our branded products. We also face intense
    competition from specialty stores that sell private label
    apparel not manufactured by us, such as Victoria’s Secret,
    Old Navy and The Gap. Increased competition may result in a loss
    of or a reduction in shelf space and promotional support and
    reduced prices, in each case decreasing our cash flows,
    operating margins and profitability. Our ability to remain
    competitive in the areas of price, quality, brand recognition,
    research and product development, manufacturing and distribution
    will, in large part, determine our future success. If we fail to
    compete successfully, our market share, results of operations
    and financial condition will be materially and adversely
    affected.

If we
    fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may be required to
    establish additional inventory reserves or we may not carry
    enough inventory to meet customer demands, causing us to suffer
    lower margins or losses.

We are faced with the constant challenge of balancing our
    inventory with our ability to meet marketplace needs. Excess
    inventory reserves can result from the complexity of our supply
    chain, a long manufacturing process and the seasonal nature of
    certain products. As a result, we are subject to high levels of
    obsolescence and excess stock. Based on discussions with our
    customers and internally generated projections, we produce,
    purchase

and/or

store
    raw material and finished goods inventory to meet our expected
    demand for delivery. However, we sell a large number of our
    products to a small number of customers, and these customers
    generally are not required by contract to purchase our goods.
    If, after producing and storing inventory in anticipation of
    deliveries, demand is lower than expected, we may have to hold
    inventory for extended periods or sell excess inventory at
    reduced prices, in some cases below our cost. There are inherent
    uncertainties related to the recoverability of inventory, and it
    is possible that market factors and other conditions underlying
    the valuation of inventory may change in the future and result
    in further reserve requirements. Excess inventory can reduce
    gross margins or result in operating losses, lowered plant and
    equipment utilization and lowered fixed operating cost
    absorption, all of which could have a material adverse effect on
    our business, results of operations or financial condition. For
    example, while our total inventory reserves were approximately
    $91 million in fiscal 2004 and $88 million in fiscal
    2006, our total inventory reserves were approximately
    $116 million in fiscal 2005, due in part to lower demand
    for some of our products than forecasted.

Conversely, we also are exposed to lost business opportunities
    if we underestimate market demand and produce too little
    inventory for any particular period. Because sales of our
    products are generally not made under contract, if we do not
    carry enough inventory to satisfy our customers’ demands
    for our products within an acceptable time frame, they may seek
    to fulfill their demands from one or several of our competitors
    and may reduce the amount of business they do with us. Any such
    action would have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Sales of
    and demand for our products may decrease if we fail to keep pace
    with evolving consumer preferences and trends.

Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond
    effectively to evolving consumer preferences and trends and to
    translate these preferences and trends into marketable product
    offerings. If we are unable to successfully anticipate, identify
    or react to changing styles or trends or misjudge the market for
    our products,



our sales may be lower than expected and we may be faced with a
    significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory. In
    response, we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions,
    provide mark-down allowances to our customers or liquidate
    excess merchandise, any of which could have a material adverse
    effect on our net sales and profitability. Our brand image may
    also suffer if customers believe that we are no longer able to
    offer innovative products, respond to consumer preferences or
    maintain the quality of our products.

We rely
    on a relatively small number of customers for a significant
    portion of our sales, and the loss of or material reduction in
    sales to any of our top customers would have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

In fiscal 2006, our top ten customers accounted for 65% of our
    net sales and our top customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for 29% of
    our net sales. We expect that these customers will continue to
    represent a significant portion of our net sales in the future.
    In addition, our top ten customers are the largest market
    participants in our primary distribution channels across all of
    our product lines. Any loss of or material reduction in sales to
    any of our top ten customers, especially Wal-Mart, would be
    difficult to recapture, and would have a material adverse effect
    on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We
    generally do not sell our products under contracts, and, as a
    result, our customers are generally not contractually obligated
    to purchase our products.

We generally do not enter into purchase agreements that obligate
    our customers to purchase our products, and as a result, most of
    our sales are made on a purchase order basis. For example, we
    have no agreements with Wal-Mart that obligate Wal-Mart to
    purchase our products. If any of our customers experiences a
    significant downturn in its business, or fails to remain
    committed to our products or brands, the customer is generally
    under no contractual obligation to purchase our products and,
    consequently, may reduce or discontinue purchases from us. In
    the past, such actions have resulted in a decrease in sales and
    an increase in our inventory and have had an adverse effect on
    our business, results of operations and financial condition. If
    such actions occur again in the future, our business, results of
    operations and financial condition will likely be similarly
    affected.

Further
    consolidation among our customer base and continued growth of
    our existing customers could result in increased pricing
    pressure, reduced floor space for our products and other changes
    that could be harmful to our business.

In recent years there has been a growing trend toward retailer
    consolidation. As a result of this consolidation, the number of
    retailers to which we sell our products continues to decline
    and, as such, larger retailers now are able to exercise greater
    negotiating power when purchasing our products. Continued
    consolidation in the retail industry could result in further
    price and other competition that may damage our business.
    Additionally, as our customers grow larger, they increasingly
    may require us to provide them with some of our products on an
    exclusive basis, which could cause an increase in the number of
    stock keeping units, or “SKUs,” we must carry and,
    consequently, increase our inventory levels and working capital
    requirements.

Moreover, as our customers consolidate and grow larger they may
    increasingly seek markdown allowances, incentives and other
    forms of economic support which reduce our gross margins and
    affect our profitability. Our financial performance is
    negatively affected by these pricing pressures when we are
    forced to reduce our prices without being able to
    correspondingly reduce our production costs.

Our
    customers generally purchase our products on credit, and as a
    result, our results of operations and financial condition may be
    adversely affected if our customers experience financial
    difficulties.

During the past several years, various retailers, including some
    of our largest customers, have experienced significant
    difficulties, including restructurings, bankruptcies and
    liquidations. This could adversely affect us because our
    customers generally pay us after goods are delivered. Adverse
    changes in our customers’ financial



position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with
    that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to
    that customer’s future purchases or limit our ability to
    collect accounts receivable relating to previous purchases by
    that customer, all of which could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

International
    trade regulations may increase our costs or limit the amount of
    products that we can import from suppliers in a particular
    country.

Because a significant amount of our manufacturing and production
    operations are in, or our products are sourced from, overseas
    locations, we are subject to international trade regulations.
    The international trade regulations to which we are subject or
    may become subject include tariffs, safeguards or quotas. These
    regulations could limit the countries from which we produce or
    source our products or significantly increase the cost of
    operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain
    countries. Restrictions imposed by international trade
    regulations can have a particular impact on our business when,
    after we have moved our operations to a particular location, new
    unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable
    regulations currently in effect are changed. The countries in
    which our products are manufactured or into which they are
    imported may from time to time impose additional new
    regulations, or modify existing regulations, including:

•

additional duties, taxes, tariffs and other charges on imports,
    including retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions, which may
    or may not be based on WTO rules, and which would increase the
    cost of products purchased from suppliers in such countries;

•

quantitative limits that may limit the quantity of goods which
    may be imported into the United States from a particular
    country, including the imposition of further
    “safeguard” mechanisms by the U.S. government or
    governments in other jurisdictions, limiting our ability to
    import goods from particular countries, such as China;

•

changes in the classification of products that could result in
    higher duty rates than we have historically paid;

•

modification of the trading status of certain countries;

•

requirements as to where products are manufactured;

•

creation of export licensing requirements, imposition of
    restrictions on export quantities or specification of minimum
    export pricing; or

•

creation of other restrictions on imports.

Adverse international trade regulations, including those listed
    above, would harm our business.

Significant
    fluctuations and volatility in the price of cotton and other raw
    materials we purchase may have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

Cotton is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of
    many of our products. Our costs for cotton yarn and cotton-based
    textiles vary based upon the fluctuating and often volatile cost
    of cotton, which is affected by weather, consumer demand,
    speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations
    and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer
    countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and
    beyond our control. In addition, fluctuations in crude oil or
    petroleum prices may also influence the prices of related items
    used in our business, such as chemicals, dyestuffs, polyester
    yarn and foam.

We are not always successful in our efforts to protect our
    business from the volatility of the market price of cotton
    through short-term supply agreements and hedges, and our
    business can be adversely affected by dramatic movements in
    cotton prices. For example, we estimate that, excluding the
    impact of futures contracts, a change of $0.01 per pound in
    cotton prices would affect our annual raw material costs by
    $3.5 million, at current levels of production. The ultimate
    effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as
    the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling
    prices are uncertain, but any dramatic increase in the



price of cotton would have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations and financial condition.

We
    incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the spin
    off, which subjects us to various restrictions and could
    decrease our profitability and otherwise adversely affect our
    business.

We incurred substantial indebtedness of $2.6 billion in
    connection with the spin off as described in
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
    Resources.” We are subject to significant financial and
    operating restrictions contained in the credit facilities
    governing our indebtedness. These restrictions affect, and in
    some cases significantly limit or prohibit, among other things,
    our ability to:

•

borrow funds;

•

pay dividends or make other distributions;

•

make investments;

•

engage in transactions with affiliates; or

•

create liens on our assets.

In addition, our credit facilities require us to maintain
    financial ratios. If we fail to comply with the covenant
    restrictions contained in these credit facilities, that failure
    could result in a default that accelerates the maturity of the
    indebtedness under such facilities.

Our substantial leverage also could put us at a significant
    competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors which are
    less leveraged. These competitors could have greater financial
    flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions, secure additional
    financing for their operations by incurring additional debt,
    expend capital to expand their manufacturing and production
    operations to lower-cost areas and apply pricing pressure on us.
    In addition, because many of our customers rely on us to fulfill
    a substantial portion of their apparel essentials demand, any
    concern these customers may have regarding our financial
    condition may cause them to reduce the amount of products they
    purchase from us. Our substantial leverage could also impede our
    ability to withstand downturns in our industry or the economy in
    general.

As a
    result of our substantial indebtedness, we may not have
    sufficient funding for our operations and capital
    requirements.

We paid $2.4 billion of the proceeds of the borrowings we
    incurred in connection with the spin off to Sara Lee, and as a
    result, those proceeds are not available for our business needs,
    such as funding working capital or the expansion of our
    operations. In addition, the restrictions contained in our
    credit facilities restrict our ability to obtain additional
    capital in the future to:

•

fund capital expenditures or acquisitions;

•

meet our debt payment obligations and capital commitments;

•

fund any operating losses or future development of our business
    affiliates;

•

obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured
    lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize our
    assets; or

•

conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities.

We may need to incur additional debt or issue equity in order to
    fund working capital and capital expenditures or to make
    acquisitions and other investments. We cannot assure you that
    debt or equity financing will be available to us on acceptable
    terms or at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient
    financing, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.
    It may be more expensive for us to raise funds through the
    issuance of additional debt than it was while we were part of
    Sara Lee.



If we raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity, any
    debt securities or preferred stock issued will have rights,
    preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our
    common stock in the event of a liquidation, and the terms of the
    debt securities may impose restrictions on our operations. If we
    raise funds through the issuance of equity, the issuance would
    dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders.

To
    service our substantial debt obligations we may need to increase
    the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that is
    expected to be remitted to the United States, which could
    significantly increase our income tax expense.

We pay U.S. federal income taxes on that portion of the
    income of our foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be
    remitted to the United States and be taxable. The amount of the
    income of our foreign subsidiaries we remit to the United States
    may significantly impact our U.S. federal income tax rate.
    In order to service our substantial debt obligations, we may
    need to increase the portion of the income of our foreign
    subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the United States, which
    may significantly increase our income tax expense. Consequently,
    we believe that our tax rate in future periods is likely to be
    higher, on average, than our historical income tax rates.

If we
    fail to meet our payment or other obligations under some of our
    credit facilities, the lenders could foreclose on, and acquire
    control of, substantially all of our assets.

In connection with our incurrence of indebtedness under each of
    our senior secured credit facility and our second lien credit
    facilities, the lenders under those facilities have received a
    pledge of substantially all of our existing and future direct
    and indirect subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon
    exceptions for foreign subsidiaries and certain other
    subsidiaries. Additionally, these lenders generally have a lien
    on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our
    subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. As a result of these
    pledges and liens, if we fail to meet our payment or other
    obligations under our senior secured credit facility or our
    second lien credit facility, the lenders under those facilities
    will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets
    and, at their option, liquidate these assets.

Our
    supply chain relies on an extensive network of foreign
    operations and any disruption to or adverse impact on such
    operations may adversely affect our business, results of
    operations and financial condition.

We have an extensive global supply chain in which a significant
    portion of our products are manufactured in or sourced from
    locations in Central America, the Caribbean Basin, Mexico and
    Asia. Potential events that may disrupt our foreign operations
    include:

•

political instability and acts of war or terrorism;

•

disruptions in shipping and freight forwarding services;

•

increases in oil prices, which would increase the cost of
    shipping;

•

interruptions in the availability of basic services and
    infrastructure, including power shortages;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulting in
    uncertainty as to future asset and liability values, cost of
    goods and results of operations that are denominated in foreign
    currencies;

•

extraordinary weather conditions or natural disasters, such as
    hurricanes, earthquakes or tsunamis; and

•

the occurrence of an epidemic, the spread of which may impact
    our ability to obtain products on a timely basis.

Disruptions to our foreign operations have an adverse impact on
    our supply chain that can result in production and sourcing
    interruptions, increases in our cost of sales and delayed
    deliveries of our products to our customers, all of which can
    have an adverse affect on our business, results of operations
    and financial condition.



The loss
    of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw
    materials may interrupt our supplies and materially harm our
    business.

We purchase all of the raw materials used in our products and
    approximately 20% of the apparel designed by us from a limited
    number of third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Our ability
    to meet our customers’ needs depends on our ability to
    maintain an uninterrupted supply of raw materials and finished
    products from our third-party suppliers and manufacturers. Our
    business, financial condition or results of operations could be
    adversely affected if any of our principal third-party suppliers
    or manufacturers experience production problems, lack of
    capacity or transportation disruptions. The magnitude of this
    risk depends upon the timing of the changes, the materials or
    products that the third-party manufacturers provide and the
    volume of production.

Our dependence on third parties for raw materials and finished
    products subjects us to the risk of supplier failure and
    customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our products.
    Quality failures by our third-party manufacturers or changes in
    their financial or business condition that affect their
    production could disrupt our ability to supply quality products
    to our customers and thereby materially harm our business.

We may
    suffer negative publicity if we or our third-party manufacturers
    violate labor laws or engage in practices that are viewed as
    unethical or illegal.

We cannot fully control the business and labor practices of our
    third-party manufacturers, the majority of whom are located in
    Central America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia. If one of our own
    manufacturing operations or one of our third-party manufacturers
    violates or is accused of violating local or international labor
    laws or other applicable regulations, or engages in labor or
    other practices that would be viewed in any market in which our
    products are sold as unethical, we could suffer negative
    publicity which could tarnish our brands’ image or result
    in a loss of sales. In addition, if such negative publicity
    affected one of our customers, it could result in a loss of
    business for us.

We have
    approximately 49,000 employees worldwide, and our business
    operations and financial performance could be adversely affected
    by changes in our relationship with our employees or changes to
    U.S. or foreign employment regulations.

We have approximately 49,000 employees worldwide. This means we
    have a significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign
    laws governing our relationships with our employees, including
    wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards,
    minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates,
    workers’ compensation rates, citizenship requirements and
    payroll taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our
    operating costs. We have approximately 35,000 employees outside
    of the United States. A significant increase in minimum
    wage or overtime rates in such countries could have a
    significant impact on our operating costs and may require that
    we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate
    such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional
    costs, expend resources responding to such increases and lower
    our margins.

In addition, some of our employees are members of labor
    organizations or are covered by collective bargaining
    agreements. If there were a significant increase in the number
    of our employees who are members of labor organizations or
    become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we would
    become vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor
    action by these employees that could have an adverse effect on
    our business.

Due to
    the extensive nature of our foreign operations, fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our
    results of operations.

We sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated
    in U.S. dollars; however, we purchase many of our products,
    pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply
    chain in foreign currencies. As a result, if the
    U.S. dollar were to weaken against any of these currencies,
    our cost of sales could increase substantially. We are also
    exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the
    reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to



the translation of operating results and financial position of
    our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, currency fluctuations can
    impact the price of cotton, the primary raw material we use in
    our business.

We have
    significant unfunded employee benefit liabilities; if
    assumptions underlying our calculation of these liabilities
    prove incorrect, the amount of these liabilities could increase
    or we could be required to make contributions to these plans in
    excess of our current expectations, both of which could have a
    negative impact on our cash flows, liquidity and results of
    operations.

We assumed significant unfunded employee benefit liabilities of
    approximately $277 million for pension, postretirement and
    other retirement benefit qualified and nonqualified plans from
    Sara Lee in connection with the spin off. Included in these
    unfunded liabilities are pension obligations that have not been
    reflected in our historical financial statements, because these
    obligations have historically been obligations of Sara Lee. The
    pension obligations we assumed are approximately
    $201 million more than the corresponding pension assets we
    acquired, and as a result our pension plans are underfunded. In
    addition, we could be required to make contributions to the
    pension plans in excess of our current expectations if financial
    conditions change or if the assumptions we have used to
    calculate our pension costs and obligations are inaccurate. A
    significant increase in our funding obligations could have a
    negative impact on our cash flows, liquidity and results of
    operations.

We are
    prohibited from selling our Wonderbra and Playtex intimate
    apparel products in the EU, as well as certain other countries
    in Europe and South Africa, and therefore are unable to take
    advantage of business opportunities that may arise in such
    countries.

In February 2006, Sara Lee sold its European branded apparel
    business to an affiliate of Sun Capital. In connection with the
    sale, Sun Capital received an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free
    license to sell and distribute apparel products under the

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

trademarks in the member
    states of the EU, as well as Russia, South Africa, Switzerland
    and certain other nations in Europe. Due to the exclusive
    license, we are not permitted to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded products in these nations and Sun Capital
    is not permitted to sell

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

branded products outside of these nations. We are also not
    permitted to distribute or sell certain apparel products, not
    including

Hanes

products, in these nations until February
    2007. Consequently, we will not be able to take advantage of
    business opportunities that may arise relating to the sale of

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

products in these nations.
    For more information on these sales restrictions see “Our
    Business—Intellectual Property.”

The
    success of our business is tied to the strength and reputation
    of our brands, including brands that we license to other
    parties. If other parties take actions that weaken, harm the
    reputation of, or cause confusion with our brands, our business,
    and consequently our sales and results of operations, may be
    adversely affected.

We license some of our important trademarks to third parties.
    For example, we license

Champion

to third parties for
    athletic-oriented accessories. Although we make concerted
    efforts to protect our brands through quality control mechanisms
    and contractual obligations imposed on our licensees, there is a
    risk that some licensees may not be in full compliance with
    those mechanisms and obligations. In that event, or if a
    licensee engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks
    that would cause us reputational harm, we could experience a
    significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely
    affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, any
    misuse of the

Wonderbra

and

Playtex

brands by Sun
    Capital could result in bad press and a loss of sales for our
    products under these brands, any of which may have a material
    adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
    financial condition.

We
    design, manufacture, source and sell products under trademarks
    that are licensed from third parties. If any licensor takes
    actions related to their trademarks that would cause their
    brands or our company reputational harm, our business may be
    adversely affected.

We design, manufacture, source and sell a number of our products
    under trademarks that are licensed from third parties such as
    our Polo Ralph Lauren men’s underwear. Since we do not
    control the brands licensed to us, our licensors could make
    changes to their brands or business models that could result in
    a



significant downturn in a brand’s business, adversely
    affecting our sales and results of operations. If any licensor
    engages in behavior with respect to the licensed marks that
    would cause us reputational harm, or if any of the brands
    licensed to us violates the trademark rights of another or are
    deemed to be invalid or unenforceable, we could experience a
    significant downturn in that brand’s business, adversely
    affecting our sales and results of operations, and we may be
    required to expend significant amounts on public relations,
    advertising and, possibly, legal fees.

Risks
    Related to Our Spin Off from Sara Lee

If the
    IRS determines that the spin off does not qualify as a
    “tax-free” distribution or a “tax-free”
    reorganization, we may be subject to substantial
    liability.

Sara Lee has received a private letter ruling from the IRS to
    the effect that, among other things, the spin off qualifies as a
    tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes
    under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended, or the “Code,” and as part of a tax-free
    reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, and
    the transfer to us of assets and the assumption by us of
    liabilities in connection with the spin off will not result in
    the recognition of any gain or loss for U.S. federal income
    tax purposes to Sara Lee.

Although the private letter ruling relating to the qualification
    of the spin off under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the
    Code generally is binding on the IRS, the continuing validity of
    the ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations
    and assumptions made in connection with obtaining such private
    letter ruling. Also, as part of the IRS’s general policy
    with respect to rulings on spin off transactions under
    Section 355 of the Code, the private letter ruling obtained
    by Sara Lee is based upon representations by Sara Lee that
    certain conditions which are necessary to obtain tax-free
    treatment under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D)
    of the Code have been satisfied, rather than a determination by
    the IRS that these conditions have been satisfied. Any
    inaccuracy in these representations could invalidate the ruling.

If the spin off does not qualify for tax-free treatment for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, Sara
    Lee would be subject to tax as if it has sold the common stock
    of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value. Sara
    Lee’s stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had
    received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value
    of our common stock that was distributed to them, taxed as a
    dividend (without reduction for any portion of a Sara Lee’s
    stockholder’s basis in its shares of Sara Lee common stock)
    for U.S. federal income tax purposes and possibly for
    purposes of state and local tax law, to the extent of a Sara
    Lee’s stockholder’s pro rata share of Sara Lee’s
    current and accumulated earnings and profits (including any
    arising from the taxable gain to Sara Lee with respect to the
    spin off). It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to
    Sara Lee’s stockholders and to Sara Lee would be
    substantial.

Pursuant to a Tax Sharing Agreement we entered into with Sara
    Lee in connection with the spin off, we agreed to indemnify Sara
    Lee and its affiliates for any liability for taxes of Sara Lee
    resulting from: (1) any action or failure to act by us or
    any of our affiliates following the completion of the spin off
    that would be inconsistent with or prohibit the spin off from
    qualifying as a tax-free transaction to Sara Lee and to Sara
    Lee’s stockholders under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D)
    of the Code, or (2) any action or failure to act by us or
    any of our affiliates following the completion of the spin off
    that would be inconsistent with or cause to be untrue any
    material, information, covenant or representation made in
    connection with the private letter ruling obtained by Sara Lee
    from the IRS relating to, among other things, the qualification
    of the spin off as a tax-free transaction described under
    Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. See

“We
    agreed with Sara Lee to certain restrictions in order to comply
    with U.S. federal income tax requirements for a tax-free
    spin off and we may not be able to engage in acquisitions and
    other strategic transactions that may otherwise be in our best
    interests”

below. Our indemnification obligations to
    Sara Lee and its affiliates are not limited in amount or subject
    to any cap. It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to
    Sara Lee would be substantial.



We have
    no operating history as an independent company upon which our
    performance can be evaluated and accordingly, our prospects must
    be considered in light of the risks that any newly independent
    company encounters.

Prior to the consummation of the spin off, we operated as part
    of Sara Lee. Accordingly, we have virtually no experience
    operating as an independent company and performing various
    corporate functions, including human resources, tax
    administration, legal (including compliance with the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and with the periodic reporting
    obligations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), treasury
    administration, investor relations, internal audit, insurance,
    information technology and telecommunications services, as well
    as the accounting for many items such as equity compensation,
    income taxes, derivatives, intangible assets and pensions. Our
    prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and
    difficulties encountered by companies in the early stages of
    independent business operations, particularly companies such as
    ours in highly competitive markets with complex supply chain
    operations.

Our
    historical financial information is not necessarily indicative
    of our results as a separate company and therefore may not be
    reliable as an indicator of our future financial
    results.

Our historical financial statements have been created from Sara
    Lee’s financial statements using our historical results of
    operations and historical bases of assets and liabilities as
    part of Sara Lee. Accordingly, the historical financial
    information we have included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

is not necessarily indicative of what our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows would have been if we had
    been a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

The historical financial information is not necessarily
    indicative of what our results of operations, financial position
    and cash flows will be in the future and does not reflect many
    significant changes in our capital structure, funding and
    operations resulting from the spin off. While our historical
    results of operations include all costs of Sara Lee’s
    branded apparel business, our historical costs and expenses do
    not include all of the costs that would have been or will be
    incurred by us as an independent company. In addition, we have
    not made adjustments to our historical financial information to
    reflect changes, many of which are significant, that occurred in
    our cost structure, financing and operations as a result of the
    spin off, including the substantial debt we incurred and pension
    liabilities we assumed in connection with the spin off. These
    changes include potentially increased costs associated with
    reduced economies of scale and purchasing power.

Our effective income tax rate as reflected in our historical
    financial information also may not be indicative of our future
    effective income tax rate. Among other things, the rate may be
    materially impacted by:

•

changes in the mix of our earnings from the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate;

•

the tax characteristics of our earnings;

•

the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that
    we repatriate to the United States, which may increase our tax
    expense and taxes paid;

•

the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing
    positions in the jurisdictions in which we transact
    business; and

•

the expiration of the tax incentives for manufacturing
    operations in Puerto Rico, which have been repealed effective in
    fiscal 2007.

We and
    Sara Lee will provide a number of services to each other
    pursuant to the Master Transition Services Agreement. When the
    Master Transition Services Agreement terminates, we will be
    required to replace Sara Lee’s services internally or
    through third parties on terms that may be less favorable to
    us.

Under the terms of a Master Transition Services Agreement that
    we entered into with Sara Lee in connection with the spin off,
    we and Sara Lee are providing to each other, for a fee,
    specified support services related to human resources and
    payroll functions, financial and accounting functions and
    information technology for periods of up to 12 months
    following the spin off (with some renewal terms available). When
    the Master Transition Services Agreement terminates, Sara Lee
    will no longer be obligated to provide any of



these services to us or pay us for the services we are providing
    Sara Lee, and we will be required to either enter into a new
    agreement with Sara Lee or another services provider or assume
    the responsibility for these functions ourselves. At such time,
    the economic terms of the new arrangement may be less favorable
    than the arrangement with Sara Lee under the Master Transition
    Services Agreement, which may have a material adverse effect on
    our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We agreed
    with Sara Lee to certain restrictions in order to comply with
    U.S. federal income tax requirements for a tax-free spin
    off and we may not be able to engage in acquisitions and other
    strategic transactions that may otherwise be in our best
    interests.

Current U.S. federal tax law that applies to spin offs
    generally creates a presumption that the spin off would be
    taxable to Sara Lee but not to its stockholders if we engage in,
    or enter into an agreement to engage in, a plan or series of
    related transactions that would result in the acquisition of a
    50% or greater interest (by vote or by value) in our stock
    ownership during the four-year period beginning on the date that
    begins two years before the spin off, unless it is established
    that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan related to the
    spin off. U.S. Treasury Regulations generally provide that
    whether an acquisition of our stock and a spin off are part of a
    plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances,
    including specific factors listed in the regulations. In
    addition, the regulations provide certain “safe
    harbors” for acquisitions of our stock that are not
    considered to be part of a plan related to the spin off.

There are other restrictions imposed on us under current
    U.S. federal tax law for spin offs and with which we will
    need to comply in order to preserve the favorable tax treatment
    of the distribution, such as continuing to own and manage our
    apparel business and limitations on sales or redemptions of our
    common stock for cash or other property following the
    distribution.

In the Tax Sharing Agreement that we entered into with Sara Lee,
    we agreed that, among other things, we will not take any actions
    that would result in any tax being imposed on Sara Lee as a
    result of the spin off. Further, for the two-year period
    following the spin off, we agreed not to: (1) repurchase
    any of our stock except in certain circumstances permitted by
    the IRS guidelines, (2) voluntarily dissolve or liquidate
    or engage in any merger (except certain cash acquisition
    mergers), consolidation, or other reorganizations except for
    certain mergers of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to the extent
    not inconsistent with the tax-free status of the spin off,
    (3) sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of more than 50%
    of our assets, excluding any sales conducted in the ordinary
    course of business or (4) cease, transfer or dispose of all
    or any portion of our socks business. We are, however, permitted
    to take certain actions otherwise prohibited by the tax sharing
    agreement if we provide Sara Lee with an unqualified opinion of
    tax counsel or private letter ruling from the IRS, acceptable to
    Sara Lee, to the effect that these actions will not affect the
    tax-free nature of the spin off. These restrictions could
    substantially limit our strategic and operational flexibility,
    including our ability to finance our operations by issuing
    equity securities, make acquisitions using equity securities,
    repurchase our equity securities, raise money by selling assets,
    or enter into business combination transactions.

The terms
    of our spin off from Sara Lee, anti-takeover provisions of our
    charter and by-laws, as well as Maryland law and our stockholder
    rights agreement, may reduce the likelihood of any potential
    change of control or unsolicited acquisition proposal that you
    might consider favorable.

The terms of our spin off from Sara Lee could delay or prevent a
    change of control that our stockholders may favor. An
    acquisition or issuance of our common stock could trigger the
    application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the Tax
    Sharing Agreement that we entered into with Sara Lee, we are
    required to indemnify Sara Lee for the resulting tax in
    connection with such an acquisition or issuance and this
    indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change
    of control that our stockholders may consider favorable. Our
    charter and bylaws and Maryland law contain provisions that
    could make it harder for a third-party to acquire us without the
    consent of our board of directors. Our charter permits our board
    of directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter
    to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock
    or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we
    have the authority to issue. In addition, our board of directors
    may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock
    or preferred stock and may set the preferences, conversion or
    other rights, voting powers, and other terms of the classified
    or reclassified



shares. Our board of directors could establish a series of
    preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying,
    deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control
    that might involve a premium price for our common stock or
    otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. Our board
    of directors also is permitted, without stockholder approval, to
    implement a classified board structure at any time.

Our bylaws, which only can be amended by our board of directors,
    provide that nominations of persons for election to our board of
    directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a
    stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the
    meeting, by our board of directors or by a stockholder who is
    entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the
    advance notice procedures of our bylaws. Also, under Maryland
    law, business combinations, including issuances of equity
    securities, between us and any person who beneficially owns 10%
    or more of our common stock or an affiliate of such person, are
    prohibited for a

five-year

period unless exempted by the statute. After this five-year
    period, a combination of this type must be approved by two
    super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met
    or the business combination is exempted by our board of
    directors.

In addition, we have adopted a stockholder rights agreement
    which provides that in the event of an acquisition of or tender
    offer for 15% of our outstanding common stock, our stockholders
    shall be granted rights to purchase our common stock at a
    certain price. The stockholder rights agreement could make it
    more difficult for a third-party to acquire our common stock
    without the approval of our board of directors.

These and other provisions of Maryland law or our charter and
    bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
    preventing a transaction or a change in control that might
    involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be
    considered favorably by our stockholders.

Properties

We own and lease facilities supporting our administrative,
    manufacturing, distribution and direct outlet activities. We own
    our approximately 470,000 square-foot headquarters located
    in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Our headquarters house
    our various sales, marketing and corporate business functions.
    Research and development as well as certain product-design
    functions also are located in Winston-Salem, while other design
    functions are located in New York City and other research
    facilities are located in London.

As of July 1, 2006, we had 165 manufacturing and
    distribution facilities in 24 countries. We owned approximately
    70 of our manufacturing and distribution facilities and leased
    approximately 95 of the remaining manufacturing and distribution
    facilities as of July 1, 2006. The leases for these
    facilities expire between 2006 and 2014, with the exception of
    some seasonal warehouses that we lease on a

month-by-month

basis. For more information about our capital lease obligations,
    see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations—Future Contractual
    Obligations and Commitments.”

As of July 1, 2006, we also operated 224 direct outlet
    stores in 41 states, most of which are leased under
    five-year, renewable lease agreements. We believe that our
    facilities, as well as equipment, are in good condition and meet
    our current business needs.

Legal
    Proceedings

Although we are subject to various claims and legal actions that

PART II

Item 5.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market
    for our Common Stock

Our common stock currently is traded on the New York Stock
    Exchange, or the “NYSE,” under the symbol
    “HBI.” A “when-issued” trading market for
    our common stock on the NYSE began on August 16, 2006, and
    “regular way” trading of our common stock began on
    September 6, 2006. Prior to August 16, 2006, there was
    no public market for our common stock. Each share of our common
    stock has attached to it one preferred stock purchase right.
    These rights initially will be transferable with and only with
    the transfer of the underlying share of common stock. We have
    not made any repurchases of our equity securities in the past
    year, nor have we made any unregistered sales of our equity
    securities.

From September 6, 2006 through September 15, 2006, the
    highest trading price for our common stock was $23.20 per
    share, and the lowest trading price for our common stock was
    $19.55 per share. The market price of our common stock has
    fluctuated since the spin off and is likely to fluctuate in the
    future. Changes in the market price of our common stock may
    result from, among other things:

•

quarter-to-quarter

variations in operating results;

•

operating results being different from analysts’ estimates;

•

changes in analysts’ earnings estimates or opinions;

•

announcements of new products or pricing policies by us or our
    competitors;

•

announcements of acquisitions by us or our competitors;

•

developments in existing customer relationships;

•

actual or perceived changes in our business strategy;

•

developments in new litigation and claims;

•

sales of large amounts of our common stock;

•

changes in market conditions in the apparel essentials industry;

•

changes in general economic conditions; and

•

fluctuations in the securities markets in general.

Holders
    of Record

On September 15, 2006, there were 68,592 holders of record
    of our common stock. Because many of the shares of our common
    stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of
    stockholders, we are unable to determine the total number of
    stockholders represented by these record holders, but we believe
    that at the time of the spin off on September 5, 2006 there
    were more than 250,000 beneficial owners of our common stock.

Dividends

We currently do not pay regular dividends on our outstanding
    stock. We expect to consider whether to adopt a policy of
    paying, subject to legally available funds, a modest quarterly
    cash dividend on outstanding shares of our common stock. The
    declaration of any future dividends and, if declared, the amount
    of any such dividends, will be subject to our actual future
    earnings, capital requirements, regulatory restrictions, debt
    covenants, other contractual restrictions and to the discretion
    of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into
    account such matters as general business conditions, our
    financial condition and results of operations, our capital
    requirements, our prospects and such other factors as our board
    of directors may deem relevant.



Item 6.

Selected
    Financial Data

Overview

Our
    Company

We are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading
    apparel brands, including

Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Bali,
    Just My Size, barely there

and

Wonderbra.

We design,
    manufacture, source and sell a broad range of apparel essentials
    such as t-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear,
    kids’ underwear, socks, hosiery, casualwear and activewear.
    Our brands hold either the number one or number two
    U.S. market position by sales in most product categories in
    which we compete.

We were spun off from Sara Lee Corporation on September 5,
    2006. In connection with the spin off, Sara Lee contributed its
    branded apparel Americas and Asia business to us and distributed
    all of the outstanding shares of our common stock to its
    stockholders on a pro rata basis. As a result of the spin off,
    Sara Lee ceased to own any equity interest in our company. In
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we describe the businesses contributed to us by Sara Lee in the
    spin off as if the contributed businesses were our business for
    all



historical periods described. References in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K

to our historical assets, liabilities, products, businesses or
    activities of our business are generally intended to refer to
    the historical assets, liabilities, products, businesses or
    activities of the contributed businesses as the businesses were
    conducted as part of Sara Lee and its subsidiaries prior to the
    spin off.

Our
    Segments

Our operations are managed in four operating segments, each of
    which is a reportable segment: innerwear, outerwear, hosiery and
    international. Our innerwear, outerwear and hosiery segments
    principally sell products in the United States and our
    international segment exclusively sells products in foreign
    countries.

•

Innerwear.

The innerwear segment focuses on core apparel
    essentials, and consists of products such as women’s
    intimate apparel, men’s underwear, kids’ underwear,
    socks, thermals and sleepwear, marketed under well-known brands
    that are trusted by consumers. We are an intimate apparel
    category leader in the United States with our

Hanes

,

Playtex

,

Bali

,

barely there

,

Just My
    Size

, and

Wonderbra

brands. We are also a leading
    manufacturer and marketer of men’s underwear, and
    kids’ underwear under the

Hanes

and

Champion

brand names. Our fiscal 2006 net sales from our
    innerwear segment were $2.6 billion, representing
    approximately 58% of net sales.

•

Outerwear.

We are a leader in the casualwear and
    activewear markets through our

Hanes

,

Champion

and

Just My Size

brands, where we offer products such as
    t-shirts and fleece. Our casualwear lines offer a range of
    quality, comfortable clothing for men, women and children
    marketed under the

Hanes

and

Just My Size

brands.
    The

Just My Size

brand offers casual apparel designed
    exclusively to meet the needs of plus-size women. In addition to
    activewear for men and women,

Champion

provides uniforms
    for athletic programs and in 2004 launched a new apparel program
    at Target,

C9 by Champion.

We also license our

Champion

name for collegiate apparel and footwear. We
    also supply our t-shirts, sportshirts and fleece products to
    screenprinters and embellishers, who imprint or embroider the
    product and then resell to specialty retailers and organizations
    such as resorts and professional sports clubs. Our fiscal
    2006 net sales from our outerwear segment were
    $1.2 billion, representing approximately 27% of net sales.

•

Hosiery.

We are the leading marketer of women’s
    sheer hosiery in the United States. We compete in the hosiery
    market by striving to offer superior values and executing
    integrated marketing activities, as well as focusing on the
    style of our hosiery products. We market hosiery products under
    our

Hanes, L’eggs

and

Just My Size

brands.
    Our fiscal 2006 net sales from our hosiery segment were
    $305.7 million, representing approximately 7% of net sales.
    Consistent with a sustained decline in the hosiery industry due
    to changes in consumer preferences, our net sales from hosiery
    sales have declined each year since 1995.

•

International.

Our fiscal 2006 net sales in our
    international segment were $388.0 million, representing
    approximately 8% of net sales and included sales in Asia, Canada
    and Latin America. Japan, Canada and Mexico are our largest
    international markets and we also have opened sales offices in
    India and China.

Business
    and Industry Trends

Our businesses are highly competitive and evolving rapidly.
    Competition generally is based upon price, brand name
    recognition, product quality, selection, service and purchasing
    convenience. While the majority of our core styles continue from
    year to year, with variations only in color, fabric or design
    details, other products such as intimate apparel and sheer
    hosiery have a heavier emphasis on style and innovation. Our
    businesses face competition today from other large corporations
    and foreign manufacturers, as well as department stores,
    specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell
    apparel essentials products under private labels that compete
    directly with our brands.

Our distribution channels range from

direct-to-consumer

sales at our outlet stores, to national chains and department
    stores to warehouse clubs and mass-merchandise outlets. In
    fiscal 2006, 44% of our net sales were



to mass merchants, 19% were to national chains and department
    stores, 8% were direct to consumer, 8% were in our international
    segment and 21% were to other retail channels such as
    embellishers, specialty retailers, warehouse clubs and sporting
    goods stores. Our net sales in fiscal 2006 were
    $4.5 billion, down 4.5% from the prior fiscal year mainly
    due to the discontinuation of low margin product lines,
    partially offset by increased

C9 by Champion

sales.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend toward retailer
    consolidation, and as result, the number of retailers to which
    we sell our products continues to decline. In fiscal 2006, for
    example, our top ten customers accounted for 65% of our net
    sales and our top customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for over
    $1.2 billion of our net sales. Our largest customers in
    fiscal 2006 were Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl’s, which
    accounted for 29%, 12% and 6% of total sales, respectively. This
    trend toward consolidation has had and will continue to have
    significant effects on our business. Consolidation creates
    pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and increasingly
    seek to have greater concessions in their purchase of our
    products, while they also are increasingly demanding that we
    provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis. To
    counteract these and other effects of consolidation, it has
    become increasingly important to increase operational efficiency
    and lower costs. As discussed below, for example, we are moving
    more of our supply chain from domestic to foreign locations to
    lower the costs of our operational structure.

Anticipating changes in and managing our operations in response
    to consumer preferences remains an important element of our
    business. In recent years, we have experienced changes in our
    net sales, revenues and cash flows in accordance with changes in
    consumer preferences and trends. For example, since fiscal 1995,
    net sales in our hosiery segment have declined in connection
    with a larger sustained decline in the hosiery industry. The
    hosiery segment only comprises 7% of our sales, however, and as
    a result, the decline in the hosiery segment has not had a
    significant impact on our net sales, revenues or cash flows.
    Generally, we manage the hosiery segment for cash, placing an
    emphasis on reducing our cost structure and managing cash
    efficiently.

Our
    Key Business Strategies

Our mission is to grow earnings and cash flow by integrating our
    operations, optimizing our supply chain, increasing our brand
    leadership and leveraging and strengthening our retail
    relationships. Specifically, we intend to focus on the following
    strategic initiatives:

•

Create a More Integrated, Focused Company.

Historically,
    we have had a decentralized operating structure, with many
    distinct operating units. We are in the process of consolidating
    functions, such as purchasing, finance, manufacturing/sourcing,
    planning, marketing and product development, across all of our
    product categories in the United States. We also are in the
    process of integrating our distribution operations and
    information technology systems. We believe that these
    initiatives will streamline our operations, improve our
    inventory management, reduce costs, standardize processes and
    allow us to distribute our products more effectively to
    retailers. We expect that our initiative to integrate our
    technology systems also will provide us with more timely
    information, increasing our ability to allocate capital and
    manage our business more effectively.

•

Develop a Lower-Cost Efficient Supply Chain.

As a
    provider of high-volume products, we are continually seeking to
    improve our cost-competitiveness and operating flexibility
    through supply chain initiatives. Over the next several years,
    we will continue to transition additional parts of our supply
    chain from the United States to locations in Central America,
    the Caribbean Basin and Asia in an effort to optimize our cost
    structure. We intend to continue to self-manufacture core
    products where we can protect or gain a significant cost
    advantage through scale or in cases where we seek to protect
    proprietary processes and technology. We plan to continue to
    selectively source product categories that do not meet these
    criteria from third-party manufacturers. We expect that in
    future years our supply chain will become more balanced across
    the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. We expect that these
    changes in our supply chain will result in significant cost
    efficiencies and increased asset utilization.

•

Increase the Strength of Our Brands with Consumers.

We
    intend to increase our level of marketing support behind our key
    brands with targeted, effective advertising and marketing
    campaigns. For



example, in fiscal 2005, we launched a comprehensive marketing
    campaign titled “Look Who We’ve Got Our Hanes on
    Now,” which we believe significantly increased positive
    consumer attitudes about the

Hanes

brand in the areas of
    stylishness, distinctiveness and

up-to-date

products. Our ability to react to changing customer needs and
    industry trends will continue to be key to our success. Our
    design, research and product development teams, in partnership
    with our marketing teams, drive our efforts to bring innovations
    to market. We intend to leverage our insights into consumer
    demand in the apparel essentials industry to develop new
    products within our existing lines and to modify our existing
    core products in ways that make them more appealing, addressing
    changing customer needs and industry trends.

•

Strengthen Our Retail Relationships.

We intend to expand
    our market share at large, national retailers by applying our
    extensive category and product knowledge, leveraging our use of
    multi-functional customer management teams and developing new
    customer-specific programs such as

C9 by Champion

for
    Target. Our goal is to strengthen and deepen our existing
    strategic relationships with retailers and develop new strategic
    relationships. Additionally, we plan to expand distribution by
    providing manufacturing and production of apparel essentials
    products to specialty stores and other distribution channels,
    such as direct to consumer through the Internet.

Restructuring
    and Transformation Plans

Over the past several years, we have undertaken a variety of
    restructuring efforts designed to improve operating efficiencies
    and lower costs. We have closed plant locations, reduced our
    workforce, and relocated some of our domestic manufacturing
    capacity to lower cost locations. For example, we recently
    closed two facilities in the United States and one in Mexico.
    While we believe that these efforts have had and will continue
    to have a beneficial impact on our operational efficiency and
    cost structure, we have incurred significant costs to implement
    these initiatives. In particular, we have recorded charges for
    severance and other employment-related obligations relating to
    workforce reductions, as well as payments in connection with
    lease and other contract terminations. These amounts are
    included in the “Charges for (income from) exit
    activities” and “Selling, general and administrative
    expenses” lines of our statements of income. As a result of
    the exit activities taken since the beginning of fiscal 2004,
    our cost structure was reduced and efficiencies improved,
    generating savings of $80.2 million. For more information
    about the fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006 restructuring activities,
    see Note 5, titled “Exit Activities” to our
    Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements included
    elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

As further plans are developed and approved by management and
    our board of directors, we expect to recognize additional exit
    costs to eliminate duplicative functions within the organization
    and transition a significant portion of our manufacturing
    capacity to lower-cost locations. As part of our efforts to
    consolidate our operations, we also are in the process of
    integrating information technology systems across our company.
    This process involves the replacement of eight independent
    information technology platforms with a unified enterprise
    system, which will integrate all of our departments and
    functions into common software that runs off a single database.
    Once this plan is developed and approved by management, a number
    of variables will impact the cost and timing of installing and
    transitioning to new information technology systems.

Components
    of Net Sales and Expense

Net
    sales

We generate net sales by selling apparel essentials such as
    t-shirts, bras, panties, men’s underwear, kids’
    underwear, socks, hosiery, casualwear and activewear. Our net
    sales are recognized net of discounts, coupons, rebates,
    volume-based incentives and cooperative advertising costs. We
    recognize net sales when title and risk of loss pass to our
    customers. Net sales include an estimate for returns and
    allowances based upon historical return experience. We also
    offer a variety of sales incentives to resellers and consumers
    that are recorded as reductions to net sales.



Cost
    of sales

Our cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing finished
    goods, which consists largely of labor and raw materials such as
    cotton and petroleum-based products. Our cost of sales also
    includes finished goods sourced from third-party manufacturers
    who supply us with products based on our designs as well as
    charges for slow moving or obsolete inventories. Rebates,
    discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor
    related to inventory purchases are reflected in cost of sales
    when the related inventory item is sold. Our costs of sales do
    not include shipping and handling costs, and thus our gross
    margins may not be comparable to those of other entities that
    include such costs in costs of sales.

Selling,
    general and administrative expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses, or
    “SG&A expenses,” include selling, advertising,
    shipping, handling and distribution costs, rent on leased
    facilities, depreciation on owned facilities and equipment and
    other general and administrative expenses. Also included are
    allocations of corporate expenses and charges which consist of
    expenses for business insurance, medical insurance, employee
    benefit plan amounts and, because we were part of Sara Lee
    during all periods presented, allocations from Sara Lee for
    certain centralized administration costs for treasury, real
    estate, accounting, auditing, tax, risk management, human
    resources and benefits administration. These allocations of
    centralized administration costs were determined on bases that
    we and Sara Lee considered to be reasonable and take into
    consideration and include relevant operating profit, fixed
    assets, sales and payroll. SG&A expenses also include
    management payroll, benefits, travel, information systems,
    accounting, insurance and legal expenses.

Charges
    for (income from) exit activities

We have from time to time closed facilities and reduced
    headcount, including in connection with previously announced
    restructuring and business transformation plans. We refer to
    these activities as exit activities. When we decide to close
    facilities or reduce headcount we take estimated charges for
    such exit activities, including charges for exited noncancelable
    leases and other contractual obligations, as well as severance
    and benefits. If the actual charge is different from the
    original estimate, an adjustment is recognized in the period
    such change in estimate is identified.

Interest
    expense

As part of our historical relationship with Sara Lee, we engaged
    in intercompany borrowings. We also have borrowed monies from
    third parties under a credit facility and a revolving line of
    credit. The interest charged under these facilities was recorded
    as interest expense. We are no longer able to borrow from Sara
    Lee. As part of the spin off on September 5, 2006, we
    incurred $2.6 billion of debt in the form of a new senior
    secured credit facility, a new senior secured second lien credit
    facility and a bridge loan facility, $2.4 billion of the
    proceeds of which was paid to Sara Lee. As a result, our
    interest expense in future periods will be substantially higher
    than in historical periods.

Interest
    income

Interest income is the return we earned on our cash and cash
    equivalents and, historically, on money we lent to Sara Lee as
    part of its corporate cash management practices. Our cash and
    cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investments with
    original maturities of three months or less.

Income
    tax expense (benefit)

Our effective income tax rate fluctuates from period to period
    and can be materially impacted by, among other things:

•

changes in the mix of our earnings from the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate;

•

the tax characteristics of our earnings;



•

the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that
    we repatriate to the United States, which may increase our tax
    expense and taxes paid;

•

the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing
    positions in the jurisdictions in which we transact
    business; and

•

the expiration of the tax incentives for manufacturing
    operations in Puerto Rico, which have been repealed effective in
    fiscal 2007.

In particular, to service the substantial amount of debt we
    incurred in connection with the spin off and to meet other
    general corporate needs, we may have less flexibility than we
    have had previously regarding the timing or amount of future
    earnings that we repatriate from foreign subsidiaries. As a
    result, we believe that our income tax rate in future periods is
    likely to be higher, on average, than our historical effective
    tax rates.

Inflation
    and Changing Prices

We believe that changes in net sales and in net income that have
    resulted from inflation or deflation have not been material
    during the periods presented. There is no assurance, however,
    that inflation or deflation will not materially affect us in the
    future.

Net sales declined primarily due to the $142 million impact
    from the discontinuation of low-margin product lines in the
    innerwear, outerwear and international segments and a
    $48 million decline in sheer hosiery sales. Other factors
    netting to $21 million of this decline include lower
    selling prices and changes in product sales mix. Going forward,
    we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue as a
    result of shifts in consumer preferences.

Cost of sales declined year over year primarily as a result of
    the decline in net sales. As a percent of net sales, gross
    margin increased from 31.2% in fiscal 2005 to 33.2% in fiscal
    2006. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due
    to a $140 million impact from lower cotton costs, and lower
    charges for slow moving and obsolete inventories and a
    $13 million impact from the benefits of prior year
    restructuring actions partially offset by an $84 million
    impact of lower selling prices and changes in product sales mix.
    Although our fiscal 2006 results benefited from lower cotton
    prices, we currently anticipate cotton costs to increase in
    future periods.

SG&A expenses declined due to a $31 million benefit

    reduction in variable distribution costs and a $7 million
    reduction in pension plan expense. These decreases were
    partially offset by a $47 million decrease in recovery of
    bad debts, higher share-based compensation expense, increased
    advertising and promotion costs and higher costs incurred
    related to the spin off. Measured as a percent of net sales,
    SG&A expenses increased from 22.5% in fiscal 2005 to 23.5%

    in the United States. The income from exit activities in fiscal
    2006 resulted from the impact of certain exit activities that
    were completed for amounts more favorable than originally
    expected which is partially offset by $4 million of costs
    associated with the decision to terminate 449 employees.

Our effective income tax rate decreased from 36.8% in fiscal
    2005 to 22.5% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in our effective tax
    rate is attributable primarily to an $81.6 million charge
    in fiscal 2005 related to the repatriation of the earnings of
    foreign subsidiaries to the United States. Of this total,
    $50.0 million was recognized in connection with the
    remittance of current year earnings to the United States, and
    $31.6 million related to earnings repatriated under the
    provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The tax
    expense for both periods was impacted by a number of significant
    items which are set out in the reconciliation of our effective
    tax rate to the U.S. statutory rate in Note 19 titled
    “Income Taxes” to our Combined and Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Net sales in the innerwear segment decreased primarily due to a
    $65 million impact of our discontinuation of certain
    sleepwear, thermal and private label product lines and the
    closure of certain retail stores. Net sales were also negatively
    impacted by $15 million of lower sock sales due to both
    lower shipment volumes and lower pricing.

Gross margin in the innerwear segment increased from 33.9% in
    fiscal 2005 to 36.2% in fiscal 2006, reflecting a
    $78 million impact of lower charges for slow moving and
    obsolete inventories, lower cotton costs and benefits from prior
    restructuring actions, partially offset by lower gross margins
    for socks due to pricing pressure and mix.

The increase in innerwear operating segment income is primarily
    attributable to the increase in gross margin and a
    $19 million impact of lower SG&A expenses due to
    headcount reductions. This is partially offset by
    $35 million related to higher media advertising and
    promotion spending, pricing pressures and product sales mix.

Net sales in the outerwear segment decreased primarily due to
    the $64 million impact of our exit of certain lower-margin
    fleece product lines and a $33 million impact of lower
    sales of casualwear products both in the retail channel and in
    the embellishment channel, resulting from lower prices and an
    unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by a $44 million
    impact from higher sales of activewear products.

Gross margin in the outerwear segment increased from 18.9% in
    fiscal 2005 to 20.2% in fiscal 2006, reflecting a
    $72 million impact of lower charges for slow moving and
    obsolete inventories, lower cotton costs, benefits from prior
    restructuring actions and the exit of certain lower-margin
    fleece product lines, partially offset by pricing pressures and
    an unfavorable sales mix of t-shirts sold in the embellishment
    channel.

The increase in outerwear operating segment income is primarily
    attributable to lower cotton costs and a $7 million impact

Net sales in the hosiery segment decreased primarily due to the
    continued decline in sheer hosiery consumption in the United
    States. Outside unit volumes in the hosiery segment decreased by
    13% in fiscal 2006, with a 11% decline in

L’eggs

volume to mass retailers and food and drug stores and a 22%
    decline in

Hanes

volume to department stores. Overall the
    hosiery market declined 11%. We expect this trend to continue as
    a result of shifts in consumer preferences.

Gross margin in the hosiery segment increased from 40.7% in
    fiscal 2005 to 43.2% in fiscal 2006. The increase resulted
    primarily from improved product sales mix and pricing.



The increase in hosiery operating segment income is primarily

Net sales in the international segment increased primarily due
    to the acquisition of a Hong Kong based sourcing business at the
    end of fiscal 2005, partially offset by lower sales in Latin
    America, which were mainly due to a $13 million impact from
    our exit of certain low-margin product lines. The acquired
    business contributed $40 million of sales in fiscal 2006
    most of which were sales of non-finished goods. Changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by
    $10 million.

Gross margin decreased from 39.8% in fiscal 2005 to 37.9% in
    fiscal 2006. The decrease resulted primarily from a
    $13 million impact from lower margins of the Hong Kong
    sourcing business, partially offset by margin improvements in
    sales in Canada resulting from greater purchasing power for
    contracted goods.

The increase in international operating segment income is
    primarily attributable to a $6 million impact of lower
    restructuring costs and improvements in gross margin in Canada.

Our effective income tax rate increased from a negative 12.1% in
    fiscal 2004 to 36.8% in fiscal 2005. The increase in our
    effective tax rate is attributable primarily to an
    $81.6 million charge in fiscal 2005 related to the
    repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the
    United States. Of this total, $50.0 million was recognized
    in connection with the remittance of current year earnings to
    the United States, and $31.6 million related to earnings
    repatriated under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation
    Act of 2004. The negative rate in fiscal 2004 is attributable
    primarily to an income tax benefit of $128.1 million
    resulting from Sara Lee’s finalization of tax reviews and
    audits for amounts that were less than originally anticipated
    and recognized in fiscal 2004. The tax expense for both periods
    was impacted by a number of significant items which are set out
    in the reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the

Net sales in the innerwear segment increased primarily due to a
    $40 million impact from volume increases in the sales of
    men’s underwear and socks. Net sales were adversely
    affected year over year by a $47 million impact of the
    53rd week in fiscal 2004.

Gross margin in the innerwear segment declined from 36.1% in
    fiscal 2004 to 33.9% in fiscal 2005, reflecting a
    $60 million impact of higher raw material costs for cotton
    and charges for slow moving and obsolete underwear inventories.

The decrease in innerwear operating segment income is primarily
    attributable to the following factors. First, we increased
    inventory reserves by $28 million for slow moving and
    obsolete underwear inventories in fiscal 2005 as compared to
    fiscal 2004. Second, charges for exit activities increased by
    $12 million compared to fiscal 2004. Third, operating
    segment income was adversely affected year over year by a
    $12 million impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2004.
    The remaining increase in operating segment income was primarily
    the result of higher unit volume offset in part by higher media
    advertising and promotion.

Net sales in the outerwear segment increased primarily due to
    $106 million in volume increases in sales of

Champion

products, offsetting $45 million in volume declines in
    t-shirts sold through our embellishment channel. Net sales were
    adversely affected year over year by an $18 million impact
    of the 53rd week in fiscal 2004.

Gross margin in the outerwear segment decreased from 20.9% in
    fiscal 2004 to 18.9% in fiscal 2005, reflecting a
    $45 million impact of higher raw material costs for cotton
    and additional

start-up

costs associated with new product rollouts.

The increase in outerwear operating segment income is
    attributable primarily to higher net sales, partially offset by
    a $12 million increase in charges for exit activities in
    fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004. Operating segment income
    also was adversely affected year over year by a $1 million
    impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2004.

Net sales in the hosiery segment decreased primarily due to
    $42 million from unit volume decreases and $5 million
    from unfavorable product sales mix. Outside unit volumes in the
    hosiery segment decreased by 8% in fiscal 2005, with a 7%
    decline in

L’eggs

volume to mass retailers and food
    and drug stores and a 13% decline in

Hanes

volume to
    department stores. The 8% volume decrease was in line with the
    overall hosiery market decline. Net sales also were adversely
    affected year over year by a $6 million impact of the
    53rd week in fiscal 2004.

Gross margin in the hosiery segment decreased from 41.5% in
    fiscal 2004 to 40.7% in fiscal 2005. The decrease resulted
    primarily from $1 million in unfavorable product sales mix.

The decrease in hosiery operating segment income is attributable
    primarily to a decrease in sales, partially offset by a
    $16 million decrease in media advertising and promotion
    spending and SG&A expenses. Hosiery operating segment income
    was also adversely affected year over year by a $2 million
    impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2004.

Net sales in the international segment decreased primarily as a
    result of an $18.6 million decrease in sales from Latin
    America and Asia, partially offset by an $11 million impact
    from changes in foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal
    2005. Net sales were adversely affected year over year by a
    $6 million impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2004.

Gross margin increased from 37.3% in fiscal 2004 to 39.8% in
    fiscal 2005. The increase resulted primarily from margin
    improvements in Canada and Latin America, partially offset by
    declines in Asia.



The decrease in international operating segment income is
    attributable primarily to the decrease in net sales and higher
    media advertising and promotion expenditures in fiscal 2005 as
    compared to fiscal 2004. These effects were offset in part by
    the improvement in gross margin and $3 million from changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates. International operating
    segment income also was affected adversely year over year by a
    $2 million impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2004.

General
    Corporate Expenses

General corporate expenses not allocated to the segments
    decreased in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 as a result of lower
    allocations of Sara Lee centralized costs and employee benefit
    costs, offset in part by expenses incurred for the spin off.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Trends
    and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity

Following the spin off which occurred on September 5, 2006,
    our capital structure, long-term capital commitments and sources
    of liquidity changed significantly from our historical capital
    structure, long-term capital commitments and sources of
    liquidity described below. In periods after the spin off, our
    primary source of liquidity will be cash provided from operating
    activities and availability under our revolving loan facility
    described below. The following has or is expected to negatively
    impact liquidity:

•

we incurred long-term debt in connection with the spin off of
    $2.6 billion;

•

we expect to continue to invest in efforts to improve operating
    efficiencies and lower costs;

•

we expect to continue to add new manufacturing capacity in
    Central America, the Caribbean Basin, Mexico and Asia;

•

we assumed pension and other benefit obligations from Sara Lee
    of approximately $277 million and;

•

we may need to increase the portion of the income of our foreign
    subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the United
    States, which could significantly increase our income tax
    expense.

We incurred indebtedness of $2.6 billion in connection with
    the spin off as further described below. On September 5,
    2006 we paid $2.4 billion of the proceeds from these
    borrowings to Sara Lee and, as a result, those proceeds will not
    be available for our business needs, such as funding working
    capital or the expansion of our operations. In addition, in
    order to service our substantial debt obligations, we may need
    to increase the portion of the income of our foreign
    subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the United
    States, which could significantly increase our income tax
    expense. We believe that our cash provided from operating
    activities, together with our available credit capacity, will
    enable us to comply with the terms of our new indebtedness and
    meet presently foreseeable financial requirements.

We expect to continue the restructuring efforts that we have
    undertaken over the last several years. For example, we recently
    closed two facilities in the United States and one in Mexico.
    The implementation of these efforts, which are designed to
    improve operating efficiencies and lower costs, has resulted and
    is likely to continue to result in significant costs. As further
    plans are developed and approved by management and our board of
    directors, we expect to recognize additional exit costs to
    eliminate duplicative functions within the organization and
    transition a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity
    to lower-cost locations. We also expect to incur costs
    associated with the integration of our information technology
    systems across our company.

As we continue to add new manufacturing capacity in Central
    America, the Caribbean Basin and Asia, our exposure to events
    that could disrupt our foreign supply chain, including political
    instability, acts of war or terrorism or other international
    events resulting in the disruption of trade, disruptions in
    shipping and freight forwarding services, increases in oil
    prices, which would increase the cost of shipping, interruptions
    in the availability of basic services and infrastructure and
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, is increased.
    Disruptions in our foreign supply chain could negatively impact
    our liquidity by interrupting



production in offshore facilities, increasing our cost of sales,
    disrupting merchandise deliveries, delaying receipt of the
    products into the United States or preventing us from sourcing
    our products at all. Depending on timing, these events could
    also result in lost sales, cancellation charges or excessive
    markdowns.

We assumed approximately $277 million in unfunded employee
    benefit liabilities for pension, postretirement and other
    retirement benefit qualified and nonqualified plans from Sara
    Lee in connection with the spin off that occurred on
    September 5, 2006. Included in these liabilities are
    pension obligations which have not been reflected in our
    historical financial statements prior to the spin off, because
    these obligations have historically been obligations of Sara
    Lee. The pension obligations we assumed are approximately
    $201 million more than the corresponding pension assets we
    acquired. In addition, we could be required to make
    contributions to the pension plans in excess of our current
    expectations if financial conditions change or if the
    assumptions we have used to calculate our pension costs and
    obligations turn out to be inaccurate. A significant increase in
    our funding obligations could have a negative impact on our
    liquidity.

Net
    Cash from Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities increased to
    $510.6 million in fiscal 2006 from $506.9 million in
    fiscal 2005. The $3.7 million increase was primarily the
    result of more effective working capital utilization and higher
    earnings in the business. Net cash from operating activities was
    $506.9 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to
    $471.4 million in fiscal 2004. The increase of
    $35.5 million was primarily due to an increase in cash
    generated from more efficient usage of working capital, which
    was partially offset by lower profitability in the business.

Net
    Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased to
    $110.7 million in fiscal 2006 from $60.1 million in
    fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily the result of higher
    purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing
    activities was $60.1 million in fiscal 2005, compared to
    $61.3 million in fiscal 2004. For fiscal years 2004, 2005
    and 2006, we expended $63.6 million, $67.1 million and
    $110.1 million, respectively, to fund purchases of
    property, plant and equipment and received proceeds from the
    sales of assets of $4.5 million, $9.0 million and
    $5.5 million, respectively, during these periods.

Net
    Cash Used in Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities increased to
    $1.2 billion in fiscal 2006, from $41.4 million in
    fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily the result of net
    transactions with parent companies which included net borrowings
    of $1.3 billion from parent companies and related entities,
    and $94 million of dividends paid to the parent companies
    and related entities, which were partially offset by an increase
    of $275 million in bank overdraft. Net cash used in
    financing activities was $41.4 million in fiscal 2005,
    compared to $25.8 million in fiscal 2004. During fiscal
    2005, we repaid $113.4 million to Sara Lee-related entities
    and distributed $5.9 million in net transactions with
    parent companies and related entities while incurring
    $88.8 million in short-term borrowings from third-parties.
    During fiscal 2004, we repaid $24.2 million to Sara
    Lee-related entities.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

At the end of fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006, cash and cash
    equivalents were $674.2 million, $1.1 billion and
    $298.3 million, respectively. The decrease in cash and cash
    equivalents at the end of fiscal 2006 was primarily the result
    of a $1.0 billion sweep of cash from our accounts by Sara
    Lee in anticipation of the spin off. The fiscal 2006 balance was
    also impacted by a $275 million bank overdraft which was
    classified as a current liability. As part of Sara Lee, we
    participated in Sara Lee’s cash pooling arrangements under
    which positive and negative cash balances are netted within
    geographic regions.

The recapitalization undertaken in conjunction with the spin off
    resulted in a reduction in cash and cash equivalents. In periods
    after the spin off, our primary source of liquidity will be cash
    provided from operating activities and availability under our
    revolving loan facility described below.



Amounts
    due to or from Parent Companies and Related
    Entities

A significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents on our
    balance sheet has been generated from our controlled foreign
    corporations and is located outside of the United States. When
    we were owned by Sara Lee, its policy was to determine at the
    end of each fiscal year the amount of cash to be repatriated to
    the United States and the amount to be permanently reinvested
    outside of the United States. As a result of decisions made in
    prior years to permanently reinvest earnings in foreign
    jurisdictions, our domestic operations have borrowed
    periodically from Sara Lee to meet funding requirements. In
    cases where our domestic operations had excess cash, the excess
    cash was swept into Sara Lee’s cash pooling accounts or
    lent to Sara Lee-related entities. Ultimately, the amounts owed
    to or due from Sara Lee and its related entities were driven by
    Sara Lee’s cash management policies and our operating
    requirements. These amounts have historically totaled as follows:

Changes in these balances are the result of operational funding

    “Relationship with Sara Lee and Related Entities,” to
    our Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements. All amounts
    payable to or receivable from Sara Lee and its related entities
    were extinguished as part of the spin off which occurred on
    September 5, 2006.

Notes Payable
    and Credit Facilities

Notes payable to banks were $3.5 million at July 1,
    2006, $83.3 million at July 2, 2005, and zero at the
    end of fiscal 2004. We did not use cash on hand to repay notes
    payable at July 1, 2006 and July 2, 2005 as we did at
    the end of fiscal 2004.

Prior to the end of fiscal 2006, we maintained a

364-day

short-term non-revolving credit facility under which we could
    borrow up to 107 million Canadian dollars at a floating
    rate of interest that was based upon either the announced
    bankers acceptance lending rate plus 0.6% or the Canadian prime
    lending rate. Under the agreement, we had the option to borrow
    amounts for periods of time of less than 364 days. The
    facility expired at the end of the

364-day

period and the amount of the facility could not be increased
    until the next renewal date. In fiscal 2006, the borrowings
    under this agreement were repaid at the end of the year and the
    facility was closed.

In addition, we have a RMB 30 million (approximately
    $3.8 million) short-term revolving facility arrangement
    with a Chinese branch of a U.S. bank. The facility is dated
    January 27, 2006 and is renewable annually. Borrowings
    under the facility accrue interest at the prevailing base
    lending rates published by the People’s Bank of China from
    time to time less 10% and are currently guaranteed by Sara Lee.
    As of July 1, 2006, $3.5 million was outstanding under
    this facility. In July 2006, the facility was increased to RMB
    50 million (approximately $6.35 million). We are
    presently in compliance with the covenants contained in this
    facility.



New
    Credit Facilities

In connection with the spin off, on September 5, 2006, we
    entered into a $2.15 billion senior secured credit facility
    (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”) which includes
    a $500 million revolving loan facility that was undrawn at
    the time of the spin off, a $450 million senior secured
    second lien credit facility (the “Second Lien Credit
    Facility”) and a $500 million bridge loan facility
    (the “Bridge Loan Facility”) with various
    financial institution lenders, including Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
    Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley Senior
    Funding, Inc., as the co-syndication agents and the joint lead
    arrangers and joint bookrunners. Citicorp USA, Inc. is acting as
    administrative agent and Citibank, N.A. is acting as collateral
    agent for the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the Second Lien
    Credit Facility. Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. is acting
    as the administrative agent for the Bridge Loan Facility.
    As a result of this debt incurrence, the amount of interest
    expense will increase significantly in periods after the spin
    off. We paid $2.4 billion of the proceeds of these
    borrowings to Sara Lee prior to the consummation of the spin off.

Senior
    Secured Credit Facility

The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides for aggregate
    borrowings of $2.15 billion, consisting of: (i) a
    $250.0 million Term A loan facility (the “Term A
    Loan Facility”); (ii) a $1.4 billion Term B
    loan facility (the “Term B Loan Facility”); and
    (iii) a $500.0 million revolving loan facility (the
    “Revolving Loan Facility”) that was undrawn at
    the time of the spin off.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility is guaranteed by
    substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect
    U.S. subsidiaries, with certain customary or agreed-upon
    exceptions for some of our other subsidiaries. We and each of
    the guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facility have
    granted the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility a
    valid and perfected first priority (subject to certain customary
    exceptions) lien and security interest in the following:

•

the equity interests of substantially all of our direct and
    indirect U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the voting securities
    of certain foreign subsidiaries; and

•

substantially all present and future property and assets,
    tangible and intangible, of us and each guarantor, except for
    certain enumerated interests, and all proceeds and products of
    such property and assets.

The final maturity of the Term A Loan Facility is
    September 5, 2012. The Term A Loan Facility will
    amortize in an amount per annum equal to the following: year
    1—5.00%; year 2—10.00%; year 3—15.00%; year
    4—20.00%; year 5—25.00%; year 6—25.00%. The final
    maturity of the Term B Loan Facility is September 5, 2013.
    The Term B Loan Facility will be repaid in equal quarterly
    installments in an amount equal to 1% per annum, with the
    balance due on the maturity date. The final maturity of the
    Revolving Loan Facility is September 5, 2011. All
    borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility must be repaid
    in full upon maturity.

At our option, borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit
    Facility may be maintained from time to time as (a) Base
    Rate loans, which shall bear interest at the higher of
    (i) 1/2 of 1% in excess of the federal funds rate and
    (ii) the rate published in the Wall Street Journal as the
    “prime rate” (or equivalent), in each case in effect
    from time to time, plus the applicable margin in effect from
    time to time (which is currently 0.75% for the Term A
    Loan Facility and the Revolving Loan Facility and
    1.25% for the Term B Loan Facility), or (b) LIBOR
    based loans, which shall bear interest at the LIBO Rate (as
    defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and adjusted for
    maximum reserves), as determined by the administrative agent for
    the respective interest period plus the applicable margin in
    effect from time to time (which is currently 1.75% for the Term
    A Loan Facility and the Revolving Loan Facility and
    2.25% for the Term B Loan Facility).

The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires us to comply with
    customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants. The
    Senior Secured Credit Facility requires that we maintain a
    minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum total debt to
    EBITDA ratio. The interest coverage covenant requires that the
    ratio of our EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters to
    our consolidated total interest expense for such period shall
    not be less than 2 to 1 for each fiscal quarter ending after
    December 15, 2006. The interest coverage ratio



limit will increase over time until it reaches 3.25 to 1 for
    fiscal quarters ending after October 15, 2009. The total
    debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the ratio of our total
    debt to our EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters will
    not be more than 5.5 to 1 for each fiscal quarter ending
    after December 15, 2006. This ratio limit will decline over
    time until it reaches 3 to 1 for fiscal quarters after
    October 15, 2009. The method of calculating all of the
    components used in the covenants is included in the Senior
    Secured Credit Facility.

The Senior Secured Credit Facility contains customary events of
    default, including nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment
    of interest, fees or other amounts after stated grace period;
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of
    covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; any
    cross-default of more than $50 million; certain judgments
    of more than $50 million; certain ERISA-related events; and
    a change in control (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit
    Facility).

Second
    Lien Credit Facility

The Second Lien Credit Facility provides for aggregate
    borrowings of $450 million by our wholly-owned subsidiary,
    HBI Branded Apparel Limited, Inc. The Second Lien Credit
    Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by us and each entity
    guaranteeing the Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to the
    same exceptions and exclusions provided in the Senior Secured
    Credit Facility. The Second Lien Credit Facility and the
    guarantees in respect thereof are secured on a second-priority
    basis (subordinate only to the Senior Secured Credit Facility
    and any permitted additions thereto or refinancings thereof) by
    substantially all of the assets that secure the Senior Secured
    Credit Facility (subject to the same exceptions).

Loans under the Second Lien Credit Facility will bear interest
    in the same manner as those under the Senior Secured Credit
    Facility, subject to a margin of 2.75% for Base Rate loans and
    3.75% for LIBOR based loans.

The Second Lien Credit Facility requires us to comply with
    customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants and
    includes customary events of default. The Second Lien Credit
    Facility requires that we maintain a minimum interest coverage
    ratio and a maximum total debt to EBITDA ratio. The interest
    coverage covenant requires that the ratio of our EBITDA for the
    preceding four fiscal quarters to our consolidated total
    interest expense for such period shall not be less than 1.5 to 1
    for each fiscal quarter ending after December 15, 2006. The
    interest coverage ratio will increase over time until it reaches
    2.5 to 1 for fiscal quarters ending after October 15, 2009.
    The total debt covenant requires that the ratio of our total
    debt to our EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters will
    not be more than 6 to 1 for each fiscal quarter ending after
    December 15, 2006. This ratio will decline over time until
    it reaches 3.75 to 1 for fiscal quarters ending after
    October 15, 2009. The method of calculating all of the
    components used in the covenants is included in the Second Lien
    Credit Facility.

The Second Lien Credit Facility contains customary events of
    default, including nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment
    of interest, fees or other amounts after stated grace period;
    inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of
    covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; any
    cross-default of more than $60 million; certain judgments
    of more than $60 million; certain ERISA-related events; and
    a change in control (as defined in the Second Lien Credit
    Facility).

The Second Lien Credit Facility matures on March 5, 2014
    and includes a penalty for prepayment of the loan prior to
    September 5, 2009. The Second Lien Credit Facility will not
    amortize and will be repaid in full on its maturity date.

Bridge
    Loan Facility

The Bridge Loan Facility provides for a borrowing of
    $500 million and is unconditionally guaranteed by each
    entity guaranteeing the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The
    Bridge Loan Facility is unsecured and will mature on
    September 5, 2007. If the Bridge Loan Facility has not
    been repaid at maturity, the outstanding principal amount of the
    facility will roll over into a rollover loan in the same amount
    that will mature on September 5, 2014. Lenders that have
    extended rollover loans to us may request that we issue
    “Exchange



Notes” to them in exchange for the rollover loans, and also
    may request that we register such notes upon request.

Interest under the Bridge Loan Facility shall be paid at
    the Contract Rate. “Contract Rate” is defined as of
    any date of determination, (i) from the Closing Date to,
    but excluding, the three month anniversary of the Closing Date,
    a rate of 9.6475%, (ii) on and after the three month
    anniversary of the Closing Date to, but excluding, the six month
    anniversary of the Closing Date, a rate per annum (the
    “Second Contract Rate”) equal to the sum of the First
    Contract Rate plus 0.50%, (iii) on and after the six month
    anniversary of the Closing Date to, but excluding, the nine
    month anniversary of the Closing Date, a rate per annum (the
    “Third Contract Rate”) equal to the sum of the Second
    Contract Rate plus 0.50%, (iv) on and after the three month
    anniversary of the Closing Date to, but excluding, the Bridge
    Loan Repayment Date, a rate per annum (the “Fourth Contract
    Rate”) equal to the sum of the Third Contract Rate plus
    0.50% and (v) on and after the Bridge Loan Repayment Date,
    a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Fourth Contract Rate
    plus an increase of 0.50% every three months. However, the
    interest rate borne by the Bridge Loan Facility will not
    exceed 11.50%.

The Bridge Loan Facility requires us to comply with
    customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants and
    includes customary events of default.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

We engage in off-balance sheet arrangements that we believe are
    reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations. These off-balance
    sheet arrangements include operating leases for manufacturing
    facilities, warehouses, office space, vehicles and machinery and
    equipment. In addition, prior to and during fiscal 2005, we
    participated in Sara Lee’s receivables sale program.

Leases

Minimum operating lease obligations are scheduled to be paid as
    follows: $37.6 million in fiscal 2007, $30.9 million
    in fiscal 2008, $23.5 million in fiscal 2009,
    $19.0 million in fiscal 2010, $17.7 million in fiscal
    2011 and $13.6 million thereafter.

Sale of
    Accounts Receivable

Historically, we participated in a Sara Lee program to sell
    trade accounts receivable to a limited purpose subsidiary of
    Sara Lee. The subsidiary, a separate bankruptcy remote corporate
    entity, is consolidated in Sara Lee’s results of operations
    and statement of financial position. This subsidiary held trade
    accounts receivable that it purchased from the operating units
    and sold participating interests in those receivables to
    financial institutions, which in turn purchased and received
    ownership and security interests in those receivables. During
    fiscal 2005, Sara Lee terminated its receivable sale program and
    no receivables were sold under this program at the end of fiscal
    2005. The amount of receivables sold under this program was
    $22.3 million at the end of fiscal 2004. Changes in the
    balance of receivables sold are a component of net cash from
    operating activities (“(Increase) decrease in trade
    accounts receivable”) with an offset to a change in
    “Decrease (increase) in due to and from related
    entities” in our Combined and Consolidated Statement of
    Cash Flows. As collections reduced accounts receivable included
    in the pool, the operating units sold new receivables to the
    limited purpose subsidiary. The limited purpose subsidiary had
    the risk of credit loss on the sold receivables.

The proceeds from the sale of the receivables were equal to the
    face amount of the receivables less a discount. The discount was
    based on a floating rate and was accounted for as a cost of the
    receivable sale program. This cost has been included in
    “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in our
    Combined and Consolidated Statements of Income. The calculated
    discount rate for 2004 and 2005 was 1.2%, resulting in
    aggregated costs of $5.0 million and $4.0 million in
    fiscal 2004, and 2005, respectively. We retained collection and
    administrative responsibilities for the participating interests
    in the defined pool.



Future
    Contractual Obligations and Commitments

We do not have any material unconditional purchase obligations,
    as such term is defined by Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards, or “SFAS,” No. 47, Disclosure of

Pension
    Plans

The exact amount of contributions made to pension plans by us in
    any year is dependent upon a number of factors, and historically
    included minimum funding requirements in the jurisdictions in
    which Sara Lee operates and Sara Lee’s policy of charging
    its operating units for pension costs. In conjunction with the
    spin off which occurred on September 5, 2006, we
    established the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension and Retirement Plan,
    which assumed the portion of the underfunded liabilities and the
    portion of the assets of pension plans sponsored by Sara Lee
    that relate to our employees. In addition, we assumed
    sponsorship of certain other Sara Lee plans and will continue
    sponsorship of the Playtex Apparel Inc. Pension Plan and the
    National Textiles, L.L.C. Pension Plan. We are required to make
    periodic pension contributions to the assumed plans, the Playtex
    Apparel Inc. Pension Plan, the National Textiles, L.L.C. Pension
    Plan and the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension and Retirement Plan. The
    levels of contribution will differ from historical levels of
    contributions to Sara Lee due to a number of factors, including
    the funded status of the plans as of the completion of the spin
    off, as well as our operation as a stand-alone company,
    financing costs, tax positions and jurisdictional funding
    requirements.

Guarantees

Due to our historical relationship with Sara Lee, there are
    various contracts under which Sara Lee has guaranteed certain
    third-party obligations relating to our business. Typically,
    these obligations arise from

third-party

credit facilities guaranteed by Sara Lee and as a result of
    contracts entered into by our entities and authorized by Sara
    Lee, under which Sara Lee agrees to indemnify a third-party
    against losses arising from a breach of representations and
    covenants related to such matters as title to assets sold, the
    collectibility of receivables, specified environmental matters,
    lease obligations assumed and certain tax matters. In each of
    these circumstances, payment by Sara Lee is conditioned on the
    other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified
    in the contract. These procedures allow Sara Lee to challenge
    the other party’s claims. In addition, Sara Lee’s
    obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of
    time

and/or

amount, and in some cases Sara Lee or the related entities may
    have recourse against third-parties for certain payments made by
    Sara Lee. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential
    amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, due
    to the conditional nature of Sara Lee’s obligations and the
    unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
    agreement. Historically, payments made by Sara Lee under these
    agreements have not been material, and no amounts are accrued
    for these items on our Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of July 1, 2006, these contracts included the guarantee
    of credit limits with third-party banks, and guarantees over
    supplier purchases. We had not guaranteed or undertaken any
    obligation on behalf of Sara Lee or any other related entities
    as of July 1, 2006.

Significant
    Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in
    Note 3, titled “Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies,” to our Combined and Consolidated Financial
    Statements. In most cases, the accounting policies we utilize
    are the only ones permissible under generally accepted
    accounting principles (GAAP). However, applying these policies
    requires significant judgments or a complex estimation process
    that can affect our results of operations and financial
    position. We base our estimates on our historical experience and
    other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. If actual
    amounts are ultimately different from our previous estimates, we
    include the revisions in our results of operations for the
    period in which the actual amounts become known.

Our accounting policies and estimates that can have a
    significant impact upon our operating results and financial
    position are as follows:

Sales
    Recognition and Incentives

We recognize sales when title and risk of loss passes to the
    customer. We record provisions for any uncollectible amounts
    based upon our historical collection statistics and current
    customer information. Our management reviews these estimates
    each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience.



Note 3(d), titled “Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies—Sales Recognition and Incentives,” to our
    Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements describes a
    variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and
    consumers of our products. Measuring the cost of these
    incentives requires, in many cases, estimating future customer
    utilization and redemption rates. We use historical data for
    similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive
    programs. Our management reviews these estimates each quarter
    and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other
    available information.

Catalog
    Expenses

We incur expenses for printing catalogs for our products to aid
    in our sales efforts. We initially record these expenses as a
    prepaid item and charge it against SG&A expenses over time
    as the catalog is distributed into the stream of commerce.
    Expenses are recognized at a rate that approximates our
    historical experience with regard to the timing and amount of
    sales attributable to a catalog distribution.

Inventory
    Valuation

We carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower
    of cost or market. Cost is determined by the

first-in,

first-out, or “FIFO,” method for 96% of our
    inventories at July 1, 2006, and by the

last-in,

first-out, or “LIFO,” method for the remainder. There
    was no difference between the FIFO and LIFO inventory valuation
    at July 1, 2006, July 2, 2005 or July 3, 2004. We
    carry obsolete, damaged, and excess inventory at the net
    realizable value, which we determine by assessing historical
    recovery rates, current market conditions and our future
    marketing and sales plans. Because our assessment of net
    realizable value is made at a point in time, there are inherent
    uncertainties related to our value determination. Market factors
    and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may
    change, resulting in further reserve requirements. A reduction
    in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market
    value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be
    reversed at a later period.

Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from a
    vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as
    reductions in the cost of the related inventory item, and are
    therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory
    item is sold. While we believe that adequate write-downs for
    inventory obsolescence have been provided in the Combined and
    Consolidated Financial Statements, consumer tastes and
    preferences will continue to change and we could experience
    additional inventory write downs in the future.

Depreciation
    and Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment

We state property, plant and equipment at its historical cost,
    and we compute depreciation using the straight-line method over
    the asset’s life. We estimate an asset’s life based on
    historical experience, manufacturers’ estimates,
    engineering or appraisal evaluations, our future business plans
    and the period over which the asset will economically benefit
    us, which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life.
    Our policies require that we periodically review our
    assets’ remaining depreciable lives based upon actual
    experience and expected future utilization. Based upon current
    levels of depreciation, the average remaining depreciable life
    of our net property other than land is five years.

We test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in
    business climate, current period operating or cash flow losses,
    forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an
    asset will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We
    evaluate an asset’s recoverability by comparing the
    asset’s net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted
    cash flows we expect such asset will generate. If we determine
    that an asset is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment
    loss in the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
    exceeds its estimated fair value.

When we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use,
    we depreciate the asset’s adjusted carrying amount over its
    remaining useful life. We do not restore previously recognized
    impairment losses.



Trademarks
    and Other Identifiable Intangibles

Trademarks and computer software are our primary identifiable
    intangible assets. We amortize identifiable intangibles with
    finite lives, and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles
    with indefinite lives. We base the estimated useful life of an
    identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors,
    including the effects of demand, competition, expected changes
    in distribution channels and the level of maintenance
    expenditures required to obtain future cash flows. As of
    July 1, 2006, the net book value of trademarks and other
    identifiable intangible assets was $136.4 million, of which
    we are amortizing the entire balance. We anticipate that our
    amortization expense for the next year will be $6.9 million.

We evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to
    amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used
    to evaluate asset amortization described above under
    “—Depreciation and Impairment of Property, Plant and
    Equipment.” We assess identifiable intangible assets not
    subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and
    more often as triggering events occur. In order to determine the
    impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to
    amortization, we compare the fair value of the intangible asset
    to its carrying amount. We recognize an impairment loss for the
    amount by which an identifiable intangible asset’s carrying
    value exceeds its fair value.

We measure a trademark’s fair value using the royalty saved
    method. We determine the royalty saved method by evaluating
    various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows,
    including operating results, business plans, and present value
    techniques. The rates we use to discount cash flows are based on
    interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time.
    Because there are inherent uncertainties related to these
    factors and our judgment in applying them, the assumptions
    underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner
    that impairment in value may occur in the future. Such
    impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes
    known.

Assets
    and Liabilities Acquired in Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions using the purchase method,
    which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business
    to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated
    fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize the excess of
    an acquired business’s cost over the fair value of acquired
    assets and liabilities as goodwill as discussed below under
    “Goodwill.” We use a variety of information sources to
    determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. We
    use third-party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives
    of property and identifiable intangibles, consulting actuaries
    to determine the fair value of obligations associated with
    defined benefit pension plans, and legal counsel to assess
    obligations associated with legal and environmental claims.

Goodwill

As of July 1, 2006, we had $278.7 million of goodwill.
    We do not amortize goodwill, but we assess for impairment at
    least annually and more often as triggering events occur.
    Historically, we have performed our annual review in the second
    quarter of each year.

In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, we estimate the
    fair value of our reporting units. Reporting units are business
    components one level below the operating segment level for which
    discrete information is available and reviewed by segment
    management. We rely on a number of factors to determine the fair
    value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to
    discount anticipated future cash flows, including operating
    results, business plans, and present value techniques. As
    discussed above under “Trademarks and Other Identifiable
    Intangibles,” there are inherent uncertainties related to
    these factors, and our judgment in applying them and the
    assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in
    such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.
    Such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it
    becomes known.

We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step
    process based on an evaluation of reporting units. The first
    step involves a comparison of a reporting unit’s fair value
    to its carrying value. In the second step, if the reporting
    unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, we compare
    the goodwill’s implied fair value



and its carrying value. If the goodwill’s carrying value
    exceeds its implied fair value, we recognize an impairment loss
    in an amount equal to such excess.

Insurance
    Reserves

Prior to the spin off, we were insured through Sara Lee for
    property, worker’s compensation, and other casualty
    programs, subject to minimum claims thresholds. Because the Sara
    Lee programs cover a large number of participants in many
    domestic Sara Lee operating units in addition to us, Sara Lee
    charges an amount to cover premium costs to each operating unit.
    In connection with the spin off which occurred on
    September 5, 2006, we obtained our own insurance coverage,
    the costs for which are greater than the costs realized as a
    participant in Sara Lee’s programs.

Income
    Taxes

Historically, all income taxes have been computed and reported
    on a separate return basis as if we were not part of Sara Lee.
    Deferred taxes were recognized for the future tax effects of
    temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
    using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences
    are expected to reverse. Net operating loss carry forwards had
    been determined in our Combined and Consolidated Financial
    Statements as if we were separate from Sara Lee, resulting in a
    different net operating loss carry forward amount than reflected
    by Sara Lee. Given our continuing losses in certain geographic
    locations on a separate return basis, a valuation reserve has
    been established for the value of the deferred tax assets
    relating to these specific locations. Federal income taxes are
    provided on that portion of our income of foreign subsidiaries
    that is expected to be remitted to the United States and be
    taxable, reflecting the historical decisions made by Sara Lee
    with regards to earnings permanently reinvested in foreign
    jurisdictions. In periods after the spin off, we may make
    different decisions as to the amount of earnings permanently
    reinvested in foreign jurisdictions, due to anticipated cash
    flow or other business requirements, which may result in a
    different federal income tax provision.

Sara Lee’s management periodically estimates the probable
    tax obligations of Sara Lee using historical experience in tax
    jurisdictions and its informed judgment. These estimates have
    been included in our Combined and Consolidated Statements of
    Income to the extent applicable to us on a stand-alone basis.
    There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation
    of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact
    business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time
    may change based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as
    changes to, or further interpretations of, regulations. Sara Lee
    has historically adjusted its income tax expense in the period
    in which these events occur, and these adjustments are included
    in our Combined and Consolidated Statements of Income. If such
    changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate
    may increase or decrease in any period.

In conjunction with the spin off, we and Sara Lee entered into a
    Tax Sharing Agreement. This agreement allocates responsibilities
    between us and Sara Lee for taxes and certain other tax matters.
    Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Sara Lee generally is liable
    for all U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes
    attributable to us with respect to taxable periods ending on or
    before September 5, 2006. Sara Lee also is liable for
    income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods
    beginning before September 5, 2006 and ending after
    September 5, 2006, but only to the extent those taxes are
    allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on
    September 5, 2006. We are generally liable for all other
    taxes attributable to us. Changes in the amounts payable or
    receivable by us under the stipulations of this agreement may
    impact our tax provision in any period.

Stock
    Compensation

During the periods presented, Sara Lee restricted stock units,
    or “RSUs,” and stock options were issued to our
    employees in exchange for employee services. See Note 4 to
    the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements regarding
    stock-based compensation for further information on these
    awards. The cost of RSUs and other equity-based awards is equal
    to the fair value of the award at the date of grant, and
    compensation expense is recognized for those awards earned over
    the service period. Certain of the RSUs vest based upon



the employee achieving certain defined performance measures.
    During the service period, management estimates the number of
    awards that will meet the defined performance measures. With
    regard to stock options, at the date of grant, we determine the
    fair value of the award using the Black-Scholes option pricing
    formula. Management estimates the period of time the employee
    will hold the option prior to exercise and the expected
    volatility of Sara Lee’s stock, each of which impacts the
    fair value of the stock options.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans

For a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost, plan
    obligations, plan assets, and how we measure the amount of these
    costs, see Note 17, titled “Employee Benefit
    Plans,” to our Combined and Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

The following assumptions were used by Sara Lee to calculate the
    pension costs and obligations of the plans in which we
    participated prior to the spin off. We are in the process of
    assessing whether and to what extent we will use these same
    assumptions going forward.

Sara Lee’s policies regarding the establishment of pension
    assumptions and allocating the cost of participation in its
    company wide plans during the periods presented were as follows:

•

In determining the discount rate, Sara Lee utilized the yield on
    high-quality fixed-income investments that have a AA bond rating
    and match the average duration of the pension obligations.

•

Salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience
    and anticipated future management actions.

•

In determining the long term rate of return on plan assets Sara
    Lee assumed that the historical long term compound growth rate
    of equity and fixed income securities would predict the future
    returns of similar investments in the plan portfolio. Investment
    management and other fees paid out of plan assets were factored
    into the determination of asset return assumptions.

•

Retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while
    standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality.

•

Operating units which participated in one of Sara Lee’s
    company wide defined benefit pension plans were allocated a
    portion of the total annual cost of the plan. Consulting
    actuaries determined the allocated cost by determining the
    service cost associated with the employees of each operating
    unit. Other elements of the net periodic benefit cost (interest
    on the projected benefit obligation, the estimated return on
    plan assets, and the amortization of deferred losses and prior
    service cost) were allocated based upon the projected benefit
    obligation associated with the current and former employees of
    the reporting entity as a percentage of the projected benefit
    obligation of the entire defined benefit plan.

Although Sara Lee historically included salary increase
    assumptions, as noted above, estimated salary increases are not
    included in calculating our pension costs because future
    accruals under our pension plans are frozen so that none of our
    pension plans recognize future salary increases.

We accumulate and amortize results that differ from these
    assumptions over future periods, which generally affect the
    future net periodic benefit cost.



In connection with the spin off, we assumed Sara Lee’s
    obligations under the Sara Lee Corporation Consolidated Pension
    and Retirement Plan and the Sara Lee Corporation Supplemental
    Executive Retirement Plan that related to our current and former
    employees. The amount of the net liability actually assumed was
    evaluated in a manner specified by the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or “ERISA,”
    and will be finalized and certified by plan actuaries several
    months after the completion of the spin off.

Issued
    But Not Yet Effective Accounting Standards

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes: An Interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109

, or
    “FIN No. 48”. This interpretation clarifies
    the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
    entity’s financial statements in accordance with
    SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement principles for the
    financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions
    taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. This
    interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006 and as such, we will adopt
    FIN No. 48 beginning July 1, 2007. We are
    currently assessing the impact the adoption of
    FIN No. 48 will have on our consolidated financial
    position and results of operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange
    rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Historically, Sara
    Lee has maintained risk management control systems on our behalf
    to monitor the foreign exchange, interest rate and commodities
    risks and Sara Lee’s offsetting hedge position. Sara
    Lee’s risk management control system uses analytical
    techniques including market value, sensitivity analysis and
    value at risk estimations.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk

We sell the majority of our products in transactions in
    U.S. dollars; however, we purchase some raw materials, pay
    a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply
    chain in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign exchange
    rates exists primarily with respect to the Canadian dollar,
    Mexican peso, and Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. We
    intend to use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to
    hedge our exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates.
    A sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the
    effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange
    currencies will have on our forward and option contracts. At the
    end of fiscal 2006, the potential change in fair value of these
    instruments, assuming a 10% change in the underlying currency
    price, was $6.4 million. At the end of fiscal 2006, the
    market value of the contracts was $1.2 million. In
    conjunction with the spin off, all foreign currency hedge
    contracts were terminated and, all gains and losses on these
    contracts were realized at the time of termination.

Interest
    Rates

Our historic interest rate exposure primarily relates to
    intercompany loans or other amounts due to or from Sara Lee,
    cash balances (positive or negative) in foreign cash pool
    accounts which we have maintained with Sara Lee in the past, and
    cash held in short-term investment accounts outside of the
    United States. We have not historically used financial
    instruments to address our exposure to interest rate movements.

Various notes receivable and notes payable between us and Sara
    Lee are reflected on the Combined and Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. These notes receivable and payable were capitalized by
    the parties in connection with the spin off that occurred on
    September 5, 2006. In connection with the spin off, we
    incurred (i) $1.65 billion of indebtedness funded
    under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, which includes the
    additional $500.0 million Revolving Loan Facility which was
    undrawn at the closing of the spin off and
    (ii) $450.0 million of indebtedness under the Second
    Lien Credit Facility that bears interest at a floating rate
    based on a published market rate plus the applicable margin from
    the credit agreements. We also incurred $500.0 million of
    indebtedness under the Bridge Loan Facility that has a floating
    rate of interest and there can be no assurance that we will be
    able to refinance this indebtedness at the same or better rates
    upon maturity. We paid



$2.4 billion of the proceeds of this debt to Sara Lee. We
    are exposed to interest rate risk from the floating rate debt
    issuance and we are required to hedge a portion of our floating
    rate debt under our credit facilities. Prior to any hedging
    activities, a 25-basis point movement in the interest rate
    charged on the floating rate debt that we incurred on
    September 5, 2006 would result in a change in interest
    expense of $6.5 million.

Commodities

Cotton is the primary raw material we use to manufacture many of
    our products. In addition, fluctuations in crude oil or
    petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials
    we use to manufacture our products, such as chemicals,
    dyestuffs, polyester yarn and foam. We generally purchase our
    raw materials at market prices. In fiscal 2006, we started to
    use commodity financial instruments to hedge the price of
    cotton, for which there is a high correlation between costs and
    the financial instrument. We generally do not use commodity
    financial instruments to hedge other raw material commodity
    prices. At July 1, 2006, the potential change in fair value
    of cotton commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10%
    adverse change in the underlying commodity price, was
    $3.5 million.

Corporate
    Governance

Board
    of Directors

Our board of directors has nine members. Two of the members are
    also employees of our company: Mr. Chaden is our Executive
    Chairman and Mr. Noll is our Chief Executive Officer. The
    other seven of the members are non-employee directors. Our board
    of directors has determined that each of the non-employee
    directors is also an independent director under New York Stock
    Exchange listing standards. Our board of directors has adopted
    categorical standards of independence, which are filed as
    Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

The non-employee directors are expected to meet regularly
    without any employee directors or other Hanesbrands employees
    present.

Prior to the spin off, our board of directors consisted of
    Mr. Chaden, Mr. Noll and two representatives of Sara
    Lee. Our board of directors, as it was constituted during such
    period, did not meet in fiscal 2006, but took various actions by
    written consent.



Commencing with the first annual meeting of stockholders to be
    held after the spin off, our directors will be elected at the
    annual meeting of stockholders and will serve until our next
    annual meeting of stockholders. Our board of directors maintains
    three standing committees of independent directors: the Audit
    Committee, the Compensation and Benefits Committee and the
    Governance and Nominating Committee.

Hanesbrands has not yet had an annual meeting of stockholders.
    Hanesbrands intends to encourage the members of its board of
    directors to attend our annual meetings of stockholders.
    Security holders may send written communications to our board of
    directors or to specified individual directors by sending such
    communications care of the Corporate Secretary’s Office,
    Hanesbrands Inc., 1000 East Hanes Mill Road, Winston-Salem,
    North Carolina 27105. Such communications will be reviewed by
    our legal department and, depending on the content, will be:

•

    board meeting; or

•

if they relate to financial or accounting matters, forwarded to
    the Audit Committee or discussed at the next scheduled Audit
    Committee meeting; or

•

if they relate to the recommendation of the nomination of an
    individual, forwarded to the Governance and Nominating Committee
    or discussed at the next scheduled Governance and Nominating
    Committee meeting; or

    addition, the board of directors has determined that
    Ms. Peterson possesses the experience and qualifications
    required of an “audit committee financial expert,” as
    that term is used in applicable SEC regulations implementing
    Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight on matters
    relating to corporate accounting and financial matters and our
    financial reporting and disclosure practices. In addition, the
    Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing our audited
    financial statements with management and the independent
    registered public accounting firm, recommending whether our
    audited financial statements should be included in our Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

and preparing a report to stockholders to be included in our
    annual proxy statement. At least one member of the Audit
    Committee will be an “audit committee financial
    expert” as defined by the SEC.

The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by
    the board of directors, which sets forth the responsibilities
    and powers delegated by the board to the Audit Committee. A copy
    of the Audit Committee charter is available in the
    “Investors” section of our website,

www.hanesbrands.com.

A copy of our Global Business
    Practices is available in the “Investors” section of

Governance
    and Nominating Committee

The Governance and Nominating Committee currently is comprised
    of Mr. Cockrell, Mr. Coker, Mr. Johnson and
    Mr. Schindler; Mr. Johnson is its chair. Each of these
    directors is an independent director under applicable New York
    Stock Exchange listing standards. The responsibilities of the
    Governance and Nominating Committee include assisting the board
    of directors in identifying individuals qualified to become
    board members and recommending to the board the nominees for
    election as directors at the next annual meeting of
    stockholders. The Governance and Nominating Committee also is
    responsible for assisting the board in determining the
    compensation of the board and its committees, in monitoring a
    process to assess board effectiveness, in developing and
    implementing our Corporate Governance Guidelines and in
    overseeing the evaluation of the board of directors and
    management.

The Governance and Nominating Committee will identify nominees
    for director positions from various sources. In assessing
    potential director nominees, the Governance and Nominating
    Committee will consider individuals who have demonstrated
    exceptional ability and judgment and who will be most effective,
    in conjunction with the other nominees and board members, in
    collectively serving interests of the stockholders. The
    Governance and Nominating Committee also will consider any
    potential conflicts of interest. All director nominees must
    possess a reputation for the highest personal and professional
    ethics, integrity and values. In addition, nominees must also be
    willing to devote sufficient time and effort in carrying out
    their duties and responsibilities effectively, and should be
    committed to serve on the board for an extended period of time.

The Governance and Nominating Committee operates under a written
    charter adopted by the board of directors, which sets forth the
    responsibilities and powers of the Governance and Nominating
    Committee. This charter may be found on our website,

Share
    Retention Guidelines

Executive
    Officer Share Retention Guidelines

We believe that our executives should have a significant equity
    interest in Hanesbrands. In order to promote such equity
    ownership and further align the interests of our executives with
    our stockholders, we have adopted share retention and ownership
    guidelines for our key executives. The stock ownership
    requirements vary based upon the executive’s level and
    range from a minimum of one times the executive’s salary to
    a maximum of four times the executive’s salary, in the case
    of the Chief Executive Officer. Until the stock ownership
    guidelines are met, an executive is required to retain 50% of
    any shares received (on a net after tax basis) under our
    equity-based compensation plans. Our key executives will have a
    substantial portion of their incentive compensation paid in the
    form of our common stock. In addition to shares directly held by
    a key executive, shares held for such executive in the
    Hanesbrands Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan of 2006, the
    Hanesbrands Inc. Retirement Savings Plan and the Hanesbrands
    Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (including equivalent
    shares held in that plan) will be counted for purposes of
    determining whether the ownership requirements are met.



Director
    Share Retention Guidelines

We believe that our directors should have a significant equity
    interest in Hanesbrands. In order to promote such equity
    ownership and further align the interests of our directors with
    our stockholders, we plan to adopt share retention and ownership
    guidelines for directors.

Section 16(a)
    Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, requires our executive officers and directors, and
    persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a
    registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of
    ownership and changes in ownership of these securities with the
    SEC. We were not subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange
    Act until after the completion of the fiscal year ended
    July 1, 2006. As such our officers, directors and greater
    than ten percent beneficial owners were not subject to such
    requirements during the fiscal year ended July 1, 2006.



Item 11.

Executive
    Compensation

EXECUTIVE
    COMPENSATION

As noted throughout this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sara Lee until
    September 5, 2006, the date of the spin off. Because this
    report covers the fiscal year ended July 1, 2006, the
    compensation discussion that follows relates to the compensation
    practices of Sara Lee and does not necessarily reflect the
    compensation we will pay in the future. Future compensation
    levels could be higher or lower, because historical compensation
    was determined by Sara Lee and future compensation levels will
    be determined based on the compensation policies, programs and
    procedures to be established by our Compensation and Benefits
    Committee.

Summary
    Compensation Table

The following table contains compensation information for our
    Chief Executive Officer and four of our other executive officers
    who, based on employment with Sara Lee and its subsidiaries
    prior to the spin off, were our most highly compensated officers
    for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2006. All of the
    information included in this table reflects compensation earned
    by the individuals for service with Sara Lee and its
    subsidiaries. All references in the following tables to stock
    and stock options relate to awards of stock and stock options
    granted by Sara Lee.

For fiscal 2004, 75% of Mr. Noll’s and
    Mr. Chaden’s bonus was paid in cash and 25% was paid
    in restricted stock units, or “RSUs.” The fair market
    value of these RSUs is reported in the “Restricted Stock
    Awards” column for 2004. All other amounts reported in the
    “Bonus” column consist of cash payments for annual
    performance.

(2)

Amounts reported in the “Other Annual Compensation”
    column include the cost to Sara Lee of providing perquisites and
    other personal benefits and tax gross-ups. The amounts shown for
    perquisites for Mr. Chaden include amounts for personal use
    of corporate aircraft ($28,708 in fiscal 2006), financial
    advisory services ($24,650 in fiscal 2006 and $18,483 in fiscal
    2005), club initiation fee ($35,730 in fiscal 2005), and
    personal use of corporate automobile ($19,426 in fiscal 2006).



(3)

Amounts represent the market value of RSUs based on the closing
    price per share of Sara Lee common stock on the date of grant.
    Upon vesting, each RSU is converted into one share of Sara Lee
    common stock. This column includes (i) 37,922 RSUs granted
    to Mr. Chaden on August 25, 2005, originally scheduled
    to vest over three years in equal annual increments;
    (ii) 12,794 RSUs granted to Mr. Noll on
    August 25, 2005, originally scheduled to vest in one year;
    (iii) 9,150 RSUs granted to Mr. Wyatt, 8,419 RSUs
    granted to Mr. Evans and 8,419 RSUs granted to
    Mr. Flatow on September 1, 2005, which RSUs,
    originally scheduled to vest in one year; (iv) 13,123 RSUs
    granted to Mr. Chaden and 10,040 RSUs granted to
    Mr. Noll on August 26, 2004 in lieu of 25% of their
    fiscal 2004 annual incentive bonus, which RSUs vested on
    July 2, 2005; (v) 34,505 RSUs granted to
    Mr. Chaden, 18,055 RSUs granted to Mr. Noll, 17,150
    RSUs granted to Mr. Evans and 17,150 RSUs granted to
    Mr. Flatow on August 26, 2004, all of which were
    originally scheduled to vest over three years in equal annual
    increments; and (vi) 34,500 RSUs granted to
    Mr. Chaden and 18,055 RSUs granted to Mr. Noll on
    August 26, 2004, which RSUs vest on August 31, 2007 to
    the extent predetermined Sara Lee performance targets have been
    achieved. Vesting of all RSUs accelerated upon completion of the
    spin off except the performance-based RSUs granted to
    Messrs. Chaden and Noll, which will continue to vest over
    the applicable performance period subject to attainment of Sara
    Lee performance measures. Dividend equivalents granted on the
    Sara Lee RSUs during the vesting period are escrowed, and the
    dividend equivalents are distributed at the end of the vesting
    period in the same proportion as the RSUs vest. For Sara Lee
    RSUs granted prior to fiscal 2005, interest accrues on the
    escrowed dividend equivalents and is paid at the end of the
    vesting period with the accrued dividend equivalents. To the
    extent any applicable performance goals are not attained, the
    RSUs, and the escrowed dividend equivalents and interest, if
    any, are forfeited. The market value and the aggregate number of
    all RSUs held by each executive officer named above as of
    June 30, 2006, the last business day of fiscal 2006 (based
    on the $16.02 closing price per share of Sara Lee common stock
    on that day), were as follows: Mr. Chaden, $1,849,189
    (115,430); Mr. Noll, $975,378 (60,885); Mr. Wyatt
    $146,583 (9,150); Mr. Evans, $389,318 (24,302); and
    Mr. Flatow $389,318 (24,302).

(4)

The amounts reported in the “All Other Compensation”
    column for fiscal 2006 consist of matching contributions under
    the Sara Lee Corporation 401(k) Plan and amounts allocated under
    the Sara Lee Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    to the following officers: Mr. Chaden, $75,561;
    Mr. Noll, $48,339; Mr. Wyatt, $3,304; Mr. Evans,
    $22,482; and Mr. Flatow, $20,563.

The potential realizable value assumes that the fair market
    value of Sara Lee common stock on the date the option was
    granted appreciates at the indicated annual growth rate,
    compounded annually, for the option term. These growth rates are
    not intended by Sara Lee to forecast future appreciation, if
    any, of the price of common stock, and we and Sara Lee expressly
    disclaim any representation to that effect. Actual gains, if
    any, on exercised stock options will depend on the future
    performance of Sara Lee’s common stock.

Employee
    Benefits Plans and Arrangements

Hanesbrands
    Inc. Pension and Retirement Plan and Hanesbrands Inc.
    Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan

Our executive officers participate in the Hanesbrands Inc.
    Pension and Retirement Plan and the Hanesbrands Inc.
    Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan, or the “Hanesbrands
    SERP.” The Hanesbrands Inc. Pension and Retirement Plan is
    a frozen defined benefit pension plan, intended to be qualified
    under Section 401(a) of the Code, that provides the
    benefits that had accrued for our employees, including our
    executive officers, under the Sara Lee Corporation Consolidated
    Pension and Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2005. The
    Hanesbrands SERP is an unfunded deferred compensation plan that,
    in part, will provide the nonqualified supplemental pension
    benefits that had accrued for certain of our employees,
    including our executive officers, under the Sara Lee Corporation
    Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.

The following table shows the approximate annual pension
    benefits payable under the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension and
    Retirement Plan and the Hanesbrands SERP for our executive
    officers. The compensation covered by these plans is based on an
    employee’s average annual salary and cash bonus for the
    highest five consecutive years in the ten years ending
    December 31, 2005. The amounts payable under the pension
    program are computed on the basis of a straight-life annuity and
    are not subject to deduction for Social Security benefits or
    other amounts.

Benefits under the pension program were frozen as of
    December 31, 2005. As a frozen program, no additional
    employees will become eligible to participate in the program,
    and participants in the plan will not accrue any additional
    benefits after December 31, 2005. Messrs. Chaden,
    Noll, Evans and Flatow have 14, 14, 14 and 19 years of
    credited service, respectively, with respect to the pension
    benefits described above.



In addition to the benefits described in the table above,
    Mr. Evans will receive an estimated annual pension of
    $4,402 for approximately 8 years of credited service earned
    under an alternate formula and Mr. Flatow will receive an
    estimated annual pension of $1,515 for approximately one year of
    credited service earned under an alternate formula. Further, as
    a result of a minimum benefit formula, Mr. Flatow will
    receive an estimated annual pension $18,531 in excess of that
    shown in the table as of December 31, 2005.

The nonqualified benefits accrued by Mr. Chaden
    historically have been funded with periodic payments made by
    Sara Lee to trusts established by him. Sara Lee will make final
    payment to Mr. Chaden’s trust in the amount of
    $1.85 million approximately six months after the spin off.
    All nonqualified benefits other than those payable to
    Mr. Chaden will be paid out of our general assets.

Hanesbrands
    Inc. Retirement Savings Plan

Our executive officers and other employees also participate in
    the Hanesbrands Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the
    “Hanesbrands 401(k) Plan”), a defined contribution
    retirement plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of
    the Code. Under the Hanesbrands 401(k) Plan, employees may
    contribute a portion of their compensation to the plan on a
    pre-tax basis and receive a matching employer contribution of up
    to a possible maximum of 4% of their eligible compensation. In
    addition, exempt and non-exempt salaried employees are eligible
    to receive an employer contribution of up to an additional 4% of
    their eligible compensation.

Hanesbrands
    Inc. Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan

The Hanesbrands SERP is a nonqualified supplemental retirement
    plan. The purpose of the Hanesbrands SERP is to provide to a
    select group of management or highly compensated employees
    supplemental deferred compensation benefits primarily consisting
    of (i) benefits that would be earned under the Hanesbrands
    401(k) Plan but for certain compensation and benefit limitations
    imposed on the Hanesbrands 401(k) Plan by the Code,
    (ii) those supplemental retirement benefits that had been
    accrued under the Sara Lee Corporation Supplemental Executive
    Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2005 and
    (iii) transitional defined contribution credits for one to
    five years and ranging from 4% to 15% of eligible compensation
    for certain executives based on their combined age and years of
    service as of January 1, 2006. The transitional credits for
    our named executive officers are as follows: Messrs. Chaden
    and Flatow (15%), Messrs. Noll and Evans (12%), and
    Mr. Wyatt (0%). The transfer of the existing liabilities
    relating to the Sara Lee Corporation Supplemental Executive
    Retirement Plan to the Hanesbrands SERP was made in accordance
    with the terms and conditions of the Employee Matters Agreement
    that we entered into with Sara Lee in connection with the spin
    off.

The
    Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2006 and Initial
    Awards

General

The Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2006, or the
    “Hanesbrands OIP,” which was approved by Sara Lee as
    our sole stockholder prior to the completion of the spin off,
    permits the issuance of long-term incentive awards to our
    employees, non-employee directors and employees of our
    subsidiaries to promote the interests of our company and our
    stockholders. The Hanesbrands OIP is designed to promote these
    interests by providing such employees and eligible non-employee
    directors with a proprietary interest in pursuing the long-term
    growth, profitability and financial success of our company. The
    Hanesbrands OIP is administered by our Compensation and Benefits
    Committee. Awards under the OIP may be made in the form of stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
    stock units, deferred stock units, performance shares and cash.
    The aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be
    issued under the Hanesbrands OIP will not exceed 13,105,000
    (subject to the adjustment for stock splits, reorganizations and
    similar transactions).

Awards under the Hanesbrands OIP may be made subject to the
    attainment of performance goals relating to one or more business
    criteria within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code,
    including, but not limited to, revenue; revenue growth; earnings
    before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes,
    depreciation and amortization; earnings per share; operating
    income; pre- or after-tax income; net operating profit after
    taxes; economic value added (or an equivalent metric); ratio of
    operating earnings to capital spending; cash



flow (before or after dividends); cash flow per share (before or
    after dividends); net earnings; net sales; sales growth; share
    price performance; return on assets or net assets; return on
    equity; return on capital (including return on total capital or
    return on invested capital); cash flow return on investment;
    total stockholder return; improvement in or attainment of
    expense levels; and improvement in or attainment of working
    capital levels. Any performance criteria selected by the
    Compensation and Benefits Committee may be used to measure our
    performance as a whole or the performance of any of our business
    units and may be measured relative to a peer group or index. No
    award in excess of $5.0 million may be paid to any
    participant in any single year. If an award in excess of that
    amount is earned in any year, it will be deferred under the
    Hanesbrands Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan until it
    is deductible by us.

Clawback
    Provisions

The Compensation and Benefits Committee may make retroactive
    adjustments to, and the participant shall reimburse us for, any
    cash or equity based incentive compensation paid to the
    participant where such compensation was predicated upon
    achieving certain financial results that were substantially the
    subject of a restatement, and as a result of the restatement it
    is determined that the participant otherwise would not have been
    paid such compensation, regardless of whether or not the
    restatement resulted from the participant’s misconduct.

Initial
    Awards

Consistent with the objectives of the Hanesbrands OIP of
    providing employees with a proprietary interest in our company
    and aligning employee interest with that of our stockholders, a
    number of awards were made under the Hanesbrands OIP in
    connection with the spin off. All of these awards, including the
    date on which the awards were granted, were approved by the
    Compensation and Employee Benefits Committee of the board of
    directors of Sara Lee prior to the spin off. Two categories of
    these awards were intended to replace award values that our
    employees would have received under Sara Lee incentive plans but
    for the spin off. Two other categories of these awards were for
    other awards and for our 2006 annual awards. The timing of these
    awards is the 15th trading date following the completion of
    the spin off, which we believe was a reasonable time period to
    permit the development of an orderly market for the trading of
    our common stock. These awards were made as follows:

•

Fiscal 2006 Awards.

In anticipation of the spin off, our
    employees generally received only a partial Sara Lee award for
    fiscal 2006 in August 2005. On September 26, 2006, we
    granted the remaining pro rata portion of the award in a
    combination of stock options and RSUs that will vest ratably
    over a two-year period. These awards, including the date on
    which the awards were granted, were approved by the Compensation
    and Employee Benefits Committee of the board of directors of
    Sara Lee prior to the spin off. Generally, 50% of the value of
    the award to our executive officers was made in the form of
    stock options and 50% of the value of the award was made in the
    form of RSUs. The exercise price of the stock options is 100% of
    the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The
    awards made to our named executive officers are as follows:

Sara Lee Option Replacement Awards.

Most Sara Lee options
    granted prior to August 2006 had a shortened exercise period as
    a result of employees terminating employment with the Sara Lee
    controlled group due to the spin off. On September 26,
    2006, we granted Hanesbrands stock options to our employees who
    were active at the time of the spin off to replace this lost
    value. These awards,



including the date on which the awards were granted, were
    approved by the Compensation and Employee Benefits Committee of
    the board of directors of Sara Lee prior to the spin off. We did
    not grant these options to employees who qualified for early
    retirement under the Sara Lee pension program because their Sara
    Lee options remain exercisable until the original expiration
    date. The replacement options were exercisable upon grant at an
    exercise price that is equal 100% of the fair market value of
    our common stock on the date of grant. The options may be
    exercised for five years. The number of options granted to each
    recipient was determined based on a Black-Scholes option-pricing
    model calculation of the lost value of the Sara Lee options,
    which determination was made as of September 5, 2006 upon
    the completion of the spin off. The awards made to our named
    executive officers are as follows:

Neither Mr. Chaden nor Mr. Flatow received an option

    retirement from Sara Lee, and their Sara Lee options therefore
    continue to vest.

(2)

Mr. Wyatt did not receive an option replacement award as he
    did not hold any Sara Lee options.

In addition to these awards, each of Mr. Chaden and
    Mr. Noll received a bonus that was paid in cash based on
    our fiscal 2006 performance. This bonus was designed as an
    incentive to achieve above-target operating profit and sales
    performance for fiscal year 2006 while conducting a successful
    spin off. The amounts of these bonuses are included in the
    “Bonus” column in the summary compensation table.

On September 26, 2006, we also granted the following two
    categories of awards:

•

Other Awards.

We granted a number of awards in connection
    with the completion of the spin off. For our executive officers,
    the form of these awards was evenly split between stock options,
    which vest ratably over a three-year period, and RSUs, which
    vest on the third anniversary of their grant date. These awards,
    including the date on which the awards were granted, were
    approved by the Compensation and Employee Benefits Committee of
    the board of directors of Sara Lee prior to the spin off. The

The
    Hanesbrands Inc. Performance-Based Annual Incentive
    Plan

The Hanesbrands Inc. Performance-Based Annual Incentive Plan, or
    the “Hanesbrands AIP,” is designed to provide annual
    cash awards that satisfy the conditions for performance-based
    compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code and is
    administered by our Compensation and Benefits Committee. Under
    the Hanesbrands AIP, the Compensation and Benefits Committee has
    the authority to grant annual incentive awards to our key
    employees (including our executive officers) or the key
    employees of our subsidiaries.

Awards under the Hanesbrands AIP are drawn from an incentive
    pool that is equal to 3% of our operating income for the fiscal
    year. For purposes of the Hanesbrands AIP, “operating
    income” will mean our operating income for a performance
    period as reported on our income statement computed in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but
    shall exclude (i) the effects of charges for
    restructurings, (ii) discontinued operations,
    (iii) extraordinary items or other unusual or non-recurring
    items and (iv) the cumulative effect of tax or accounting
    changes. The incentive pool from which the Hanesbrands AIP
    awards will be drawn will be established for a performance
    period that typically corresponds to our fiscal year.

The Compensation and Benefits Committee will allocate an
    incentive pool percentage to each designated participant for
    each performance period. In no event may the incentive pool
    percentage for any one participant exceed 40% of the total pool
    for that performance period. Each participant’s incentive
    award will be determined by the Compensation and Benefits
    Committee based on the participant’s allocated portion of
    the incentive pool and attainment of specified performance
    measures subject to adjustment in the sole discretion of the
    Compensation and Benefits Committee. In no event may the portion
    of the incentive pool allocated to a participant who is a
    covered employee for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code
    be increased in any way, including as a result of the reduction
    of any other participant’s allocated portion, but such
    portion may be decreased by the Compensation and Benefits
    Committee. The Compensation and Benefits Committee may make
    retroactive adjustments to, and the participant shall reimburse
    us for, any cash or equity based incentive compensation paid to
    the participant where such compensation was predicated upon
    achieving certain financial results that were substantially the
    subject of a restatement, and as a result of the restatement it
    is determined that the participant otherwise would not have been
    paid such compensation, regardless of whether or not the
    restatement resulted from the participant’s misconduct.

Deferred
    Compensation

We have two deferred compensation programs: the Hanesbrands Inc.
    Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the Hanesbrands Inc.
    Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the
    plans, executive officers and non-employee directors may defer
    receipt of cash and equity compensation. The amount of
    compensation that may be deferred is determined in accordance
    with the plans based on elections by such participant. The
    amounts payable under the plans earn or lose value based on the
    investment performance of one or more of the various investment
    funds offered under the plans and selected by the participants.
    The amount payable to participants will be payable either on the
    withdrawal date elected by the participant or upon the
    occurrence of certain events as provided under the plans. A
    participant may designate one or more beneficiaries to receive
    any portion of the obligations payable in the event of death,
    however neither participants nor their beneficiaries may
    transfer any right or interest in the plans.



Hanesbrands
    Inc. Executive Life Insurance Program

The Hanesbrands Inc. Executive Life Insurance Program provides
    life insurance coverage during active employment for our
    executive officers in an amount equal to three times their
    annual base salary. We also offer continuing coverage following
    retirement equal to such executive officer’s annual base
    salary immediately prior to retirement.

Hanesbrands
    Inc. Executive Disability Program

The Hanesbrands Inc. Executive Disability Program provides
    disability coverage for our executive officers. Should an
    executive officer become totally disabled, the program will
    provide a monthly disability benefit equal to 1/12 of the sum of
    (i) 75% of the executive officer’s annual base salary
    (not in excess of $500,000) and (ii) 50% of the executive
    officer’s annual average short-term incentive bonus (not in
    excess of $250,000). The maximum monthly disability benefit is
    $62,500 and is reduced by any disability benefits that an
    executive officer is entitled to receive under Social Security,
    workers’ compensation, a state compulsory disability law or
    another plan of Hanesbrands providing benefits for disability.

The
    Hanesbrands Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan of

General

We intend to implement in 2007 the Hanesbrands Inc. Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan of 2006, or the “Hanesbrands
    ESPP,” which we adopted in connection with the spin off.
    The purpose of the Hanesbrands ESPP is to provide an opportunity
    for eligible employees and eligible employees of designated
    subsidiaries to purchase a limited number of shares of our
    common stock at a discount through voluntary automatic payroll
    deductions. The Hanesbrands ESPP is designed to attract, retain,
    and reward our employees and to strengthen the mutuality of
    interest between our employees and our stockholders. The
    Hanesbrands ESPP will be administered by our Compensation and
    Benefits Committee. Our board of directors may at any time
    amend, suspend or discontinue the Hanesbrands ESPP, subject to
    any stockholder approval needed to comply with the requirements
    of the SEC, the Code and the rules of the New York Stock
    Exchange.

Shares Available
    for Issuance

The aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be
    issued under the Hanesbrands ESPP will not exceed
    2,442,000 shares (subject to mandatory adjustment in the
    event of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
    reorganization, or similar transaction). The maximum amount
    eligible for purchase of shares through the Hanesbrands ESPP by
    any employee in any year will be $25,000.

Payroll
    Deductions and Purchase of Shares

An employee may contribute from his or her cash earnings through
    payroll deductions during an offering period and the accumulated
    deductions will be applied to the purchase of shares on the
    first day of the next following offering period. The Hanesbrands
    ESPP will provide for consecutive offering periods of three
    months each on a schedule determined by the Committee. The
    purchase price per share will be at least 85% of the fair market
    value of our shares immediately after the end of each offering
    period in which an employee participates in the plan.

Severance/Change
    in Control Arrangements

In addition to the plans and programs described above, on
    September 1, 2006, we entered into severance/change in
    control agreements, or “Severance Agreements,” with
    the following executive officers: Lee A. Chaden, Richard A.
    Noll, E. Lee Wyatt Jr., Gerald W. Evans Jr., Michael Flatow,
    Kevin D. Hall, Joan P. McReynolds and Kevin W. Oliver. Each
    agreement is effective for an unlimited term, unless we give at
    least 18 months prior written notice that the agreement
    will not be renewed. In addition, if a change in control occurs
    during the term, the agreement will automatically continue for
    two years following the change in control. The agreements
    prohibit our executive officers from working for our
    competitors, soliciting business



from our customers, attempting to hire our employees and
    disclosing our confidential information. Payments under the
    agreements terminate if the terminated executive officer becomes
    employed by one of our competitors. As a condition of the
    agreements, our executive officers must release any claims
    against us.

Severance

The Severance Agreements with our executive officers provide
    them with severance benefits upon their involuntary termination
    of employment. Generally, if an executive officer’s
    employment is terminated by us for any reason other than for
    cause, or if an executive officer terminates his or her
    employment at our request, we will pay them benefits for a
    period of 12 to 24 months depending on their position and
    length of service with Hanesbrands and with Sara Lee. The
    Severance Agreements prohibit our executive officers from
    working for our competitors, soliciting business from our
    customers, attempting to hire our employees and disclosing our
    confidential information while payments under the Severance
    Agreement are being made. Payments under the Severance Agreement
    terminate if the terminated executive officer becomes employed
    by one of our competitors. As a condition of the Severance
    Agreements, our executive officers must release any claims
    against us.

The monthly severance benefit that we would pay to each
    executive officer will be based on the executive officer’s
    base salary (and, in limited cases, determined bonus), divided
    by 12. A terminated executive officer also would receive a
    pro-rated payment under any incentive plans applicable to the
    fiscal year in which the termination occurs based on actual full
    fiscal year performance. The terminated executive officer’s
    eligibility to participate in our medical, dental and executive
    life insurance plans would continue for the same number of
    months for which he or she receives severance payments. The
    terminated executive officer’s participation in all other
    benefit plans would cease as of the date of termination of
    employment.

Change in
    Control

The Severance Agreements also contain change in control benefits
    for our executive officers to help keep them focused on their
    work responsibilities during the uncertainty that accompanies a
    change in control, to preserve benefits after a change in
    control transaction and to help us attract and retain key
    talent. Generally, the agreements provide for severance pay and
    continuation of certain benefits if the executive officer’s
    employment is terminated involuntarily (for a reason other than
    “cause” as defined in the agreement) within two years
    following a change in control, or within three months prior to a
    change in control. The definition of “involuntary
    termination” under the Severance Agreements includes a
    voluntary termination by the executive officer for “good
    reason.”

The Severance Agreements provide that a terminated executive
    officer will receive in a lump sum payment, two times (three
    times in the case of Mr. Noll) his or her cash compensation
    (consisting of base salary, the greater of their current target
    bonus or their average actual bonus over the prior three years
    and the matching contribution to the defined contribution plan
    in which the executive officer is participating), a pro-rated
    portion of his or her annual bonus for the fiscal year in which
    the termination occurs based upon the greater of their target
    bonus or actual performance as of the date of termination, a
    pro-rata portion of his or her long-term cash incentive plan
    payment for any performance period that is at least 50%
    completed prior to the executive officer’s termination
    date, the replacement of lost savings and retirement benefits
    through the Hanesbrands SERP and the continued eligibility to
    participate in our medical, dental and executive insurance plans
    during the change in control severance period. The change in
    control severance period is a period of two years (three years
    for Mr. Noll) following the executive officer’s
    termination date. Outstanding awards under the Hanesbrands OIP
    will be treated pursuant to the terms of the Hanesbrands OIP. In
    the event that any payments made in connection with a change in
    control would be subject to the excise tax imposed on parachute
    payments by Section 4999 of the Code, we will make tax
    equalization payments with respect to the executive
    officer’s compensation for all federal, state and local
    income and excise taxes, and any penalties and interest, but
    only if the total payments made in connection with a change in
    control exceed 330% of such executive officer’s “base
    amount” (as determined under Section 280G(b) of the
    Code). Otherwise, the payments made to such executive officer in
    connection with a change in control that are classified as
    parachute payments will be reduced so that the value of the
    total payments to such executive officer is $1 less than the



maximum amount such executive officer may receive without
    becoming subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
    Code.

Director
    Compensation

Cash
    and Equity-Based Compensation

Each non-employee director for service on our board of directors
    is compensated as follows:

•

an annual cash retainer of $70,000, which will be paid in
    quarterly installments;

•

an additional annual cash retainer of $10,000 for the chair of
    the Audit Committee, $5,000 for the chair of the Compensation
    and Benefits Committee and $5,000 for the chair of the
    Governance and Nominating Committee;

•

an additional annual cash retainer of $5,000 for each member of
    the Audit Committee other than the chair;

•

an annual grant of $70,000 in restricted stock units, with a
    one-year vesting schedule; these units will be converted at
    vesting into deferred stock units payable in stock six months
    after termination of service on our board of directors; and

•

reimbursement of customary expenses for attending board,
    committee and shareholder meetings.

Directors who are also our employees will receive no additional
    compensation for serving as a director.

For their service with us in 2006, we paid our directors an
    amount equal to half of their annual cash retainer and a grant
    of restricted stock units with one half the value of the annual
    grant.

Deferred
    Compensation Plan for Outside Directors

Under the Hanesbrands Inc. Non-Employee Director Deferred
    Compensation Plan, all non-employee directors are permitted to
    defer the receipt of all or a portion (not less than
    25 percent) of their annual retainer into a nonqualified,
    unfunded deferred compensation plan. At the election of the
    director, amounts deferred under the plan will earn a return
    equivalent to the return on an investment in an interest-bearing
    account earning interest based on the Federal Reserve’s
    published rate for 5 year constant maturity Treasury notes
    at the beginning of the calendar year, or be invested in a stock
    equivalent account and earn a return based on our stock price.
    Amounts deferred, plus any dividend equivalents or interest,
    will be paid in cash or in shares of our common stock as
    applicable. Any awards of restricted stock or RSUs to
    non-employee directors that are automatically deferred pursuant
    to the terms of the award are deferred under this plan. Any
    payment of shares of our common stock under this plan will come
    from the Hanesbrands Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2006.

Item 13.

Certain
    Relationships and Related Transactions

Prior to the spin off, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Sara
    Lee. In connection with the spin off, we entered into a number
    of agreements with Sara Lee, which are described below.
    Effective upon the completion of the spin off, Sara Lee ceased
    to be a related party to us.

Master
    Separation Agreement

The Master Separation Agreement governs the contribution of Sara
    Lee’s branded apparel Americas/Asia business to us, the
    subsequent distribution of shares of our common stock to Sara
    Lee stockholders and other matters related to Sara Lee’s
    relationship with us. To effect the contribution, Sara Lee
    agreed to transfer all of the assets of the branded apparel
    Americas/Asia business to us and we agreed to assume, perform
    and fulfill all of the liabilities of the branded apparel
    Americas/Asia division in accordance with their respective
    terms, except for certain liabilities to be retained by Sara
    Lee. All assets transferred are generally transferred on an
    “as is,” “where is” basis.

Under the Master Separation Agreement, we also agreed to use
    reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents,
    substitutions or amendments required to novate or assign all
    rights and obligations under any contracts to be transferred in
    connection with the contribution. Sara Lee’s agreement to
    consummate the distribution was subject to the satisfaction of a
    number of conditions including the following:

•

the registration statement for our common stock being declared
    effective by the SEC;

•

any actions and filings with regard to applicable securities and
    blue sky laws of any state being taken and becoming effective or
    accepted;

•

our common stock being accepted for listing on the New York
    Stock Exchange, on official notice of distribution;

•

no legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of
    the contribution or distribution or any other transaction
    related to the spin off being in effect;

•

Sara Lee’s receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS
    or an opinion of counsel to the effect, among other things, that
    the spin off will qualify as a tax-free distribution for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 of
    the Internal Revenue Code and as part of a tax-free
    reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal
    Revenue Code;

•

the contribution becoming effective in accordance with the
    Master Separation Agreement and the ancillary agreements;

•

Sara Lee receiving a satisfactory solvency opinion with regards
    to our company from an investment banking or valuation
    firm; and



•

our receipt of the proceeds of the borrowings under the Senior
    Secured Credit Facility, the Second Lien Credit Facility and the
    Bridge Loan Facility and distribution of $2.4 billion to
    Sara Lee.

We and Sara Lee agreed to waive, and neither we nor Sara Lee
    will be able to seek, consequential, special, indirect or
    incidental damages or punitive damages.

Tax
    Sharing Agreement

We also entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement with Sara Lee. This
    agreement (i) governs the allocation of U.S. federal,
    state, local, and foreign tax liability between us and Sara Lee,
    (ii) provides for restrictions and indemnities in
    connection with the tax treatment of the distribution, and
    (iii) addresses other tax-related matters.

Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Sara Lee generally is liable
    for all U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income
    taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods ending
    on or before September 5, 2006 and for certain income taxes
    attributable to us with respect to taxable periods beginning
    before September 5, 2006 ending after September 5,
    2006. We have agreed to indemnify Sara Lee (and Sara Lee has
    agreed to indemnify us) for any tax detriments arising from an
    inter-group adjustment, but only to the extent we (or Sara Lee)
    realize a corresponding tax benefit.

The Tax Sharing Agreement also provides that we are liable for
    taxes incurred by Sara Lee that arise as a result of our taking
    or failing to take certain actions that result in the
    distribution failing to meet the requirements of a tax-free
    distribution under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the
    Code. We therefore have agreed that, among other things, we will
    not take any actions that would result in any tax being imposed
    on the spin off, including, subject to specified exceptions any
    of the following actions during the two-year period following
    the spin off:

•

selling or acquiring from any person, any of our equity
    securities;

•

disposing of assets that, in the aggregate, constitute more than
    50% of our gross assets;

•

engaging in certain transactions with regard to our socks
    business;

•

dissolving, liquidating or engaging in any merger,
    consolidation, or other reorganization; or

•

taking any action that would cause Sara Lee to recognize gain
    under any gain recognition agreement to which Sara Lee is a
    party.

In addition, we have agreed not to engage in certain of the
    actions described above, whether before or after the two-year
    period following the spin off, if it is pursuant to an
    arrangement negotiated (in whole or in part) prior to the first
    anniversary of the spin off.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may engage in activities that
    are prohibited by the tax sharing agreement if we provide Sara
    Lee with an unqualified opinion of tax counsel or if Sara Lee
    receives a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS,
    acceptable to Sara Lee, to the effect that these actions will
    not affect the tax-free nature of the spin off.

Employee
    Matters Agreement

We also entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with Sara
    Lee. This agreement allocates responsibility for employee
    benefit matters on the date of and after the spin off, including
    the treatment of existing welfare benefit plans, savings plans,
    equity-based plans and deferred compensation plans as well as
    our establishment of new plans. Under the Employee Matters
    Agreement, the Hanesbrands Inc. Retirement Savings Plan assumed
    all liabilities from the Sara Lee 401(k) Plan related to our
    current and former employees and Sara Lee caused the accounts of
    our employees to be transferred to the Hanesbrands Inc.
    Retirement Savings Plan. The Hanesbrands Inc. Pension and
    Retirement Plan assumed all liabilities from the Sara Lee
    Corporation Consolidated Pension and Retirement Plan related to
    our current and former employees, and Sara Lee caused the assets
    of these plans related to our current and former employees to be
    transferred to the Hanesbrands Inc. Pension and Retirement Plan.



We have also agreed to assume the liabilities for, and Sara Lee
    will transfer the assets of Sara Lee’s retirement plans
    related to pension benefits accrued by our current and former
    employees covered under Sara Lee’s Canadian retirement
    plan, obligations under Sara Lee’s nonqualified deferred
    compensation plan, and assume certain other defined contribution
    plans and defined pension plan. We also agreed to assume medical
    liabilities related to our employees under Sara Lee’s
    employee healthcare plan.

Master
    Transition Services Agreement

In connection with the spin off, we also entered into a Master
    Transition Services Agreement with Sara Lee. Under the Master
    Transition Services Agreement we and Sara Lee agreed to provide
    each other with specified support services related to among
    others:

•

human resources and financial shared services for a period of
    seven months with one

90-day

renewal term;

•

tax-shared services for a period of one year with one

15-month

renewal term; and

•

information technology services for a period ranging from six
    months with no renewal term to one year with indefinite renewal
    terms based on the service provided.

Each of these services is provided for a fee, which differs
    depending upon the service.

Real
    Estate Matters Agreement

Along with each of the other agreements relating to the spin
    off, we entered into a Real Estate Matters Agreement with Sara
    Lee. This agreement governs the manner in which Sara Lee will
    transfer to or share with us various leased and owned properties
    associated with the branded apparel business. The Real Estate
    Matters Agreement describes the property to be transferred or
    shared with us for each type of transaction (e.g., conveyance,
    assignments and subleases) and includes the standard forms of
    the proposed transfer documents (e.g., forms of conveyance and
    assignment) as exhibits. Under the agreement, we have agreed to
    accept the transfer of all of the properties allocated to us,
    even if such properties have been damaged by a casualty or other
    change in condition. We also have agreed to pay all costs and
    expenses required to effect the transfers (including landlord
    consent fees, landlord attorneys’ fees, title insurance
    fees and transfer taxes).

Indemnification
    and Insurance Matters Agreement

We also have entered into an Indemnification and Insurance
    Matters Agreement with Sara Lee. This agreement provides general
    indemnification provisions pursuant to which we have agreed to
    indemnify Sara Lee and its affiliates, agents, successors and
    assigns from all liabilities (other than liabilities related to
    tax, which are solely covered by the tax sharing agreement)
    arising from:

•

our failure to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any
    of our liabilities;

•

our business;

•

any breach by us of the Master Separation Agreement or any of
    the ancillary agreements; and

•

any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state
    a material fact required to be stated with respect to the
    information contained in our registration statement on
    Form 10 or our information statement that was distributed
    to Sara Lee stockholders.

Sara Lee has agreed to indemnify us and our affiliates, agents,
    successors and assigns from all liabilities (other than
    liabilities related to tax, which are solely covered by the tax
    sharing agreement) arising from:

•

its failure to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any
    of its liabilities;

•

Sara Lee’s business;

•

any breach by Sara Lee of the Master Separation Agreement or any
    of the ancillary agreements; and



•

with regard to sections relating to Sara Lee, any untrue
    statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material
    fact required to be stated with respect to the information
    contained in our registration statement on Form 10 or our
    information statement that was distributed to Sara Lee
    stockholders.

Further, under this agreement, we and Sara Lee have released
    each other from any liabilities existing or alleged to have
    existed on or before the date of the distribution. This
    provision does not preclude us or Sara Lee from enforcing the
    Master Separation Agreement or any ancillary agreement we have
    entered into with each other.

The Indemnification and Insurance Matters Agreement contains
    provisions governing the recovery by and payment to us of
    insurance proceeds related to our business and arising on or
    prior to the date of the distribution and our insurance
    coverage. We have agreed to reimburse Sara Lee, to the extent it
    is required to pay, for amounts necessary to satisfy all
    applicable self-insured retentions, fronted policies,
    deductibles and retrospective premium adjustments and similar
    amounts not covered by insurance policies in connection with our
    liabilities.

Intellectual
    Property Matters Agreement

We also entered into an Intellectual Property Matters Agreement
    with Sara Lee. The Intellectual Property Matters Agreement
    provides for the license by Sara Lee to us of certain software.
    It also will govern the wind-down of our use of certain of Sara
    Lee’s trademarks (other than those being transferred to us
    in connection with the spin off).

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hanesbrands Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying combined and consolidated
    financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Hanesbrands at July 3, 2004, July 2, 2005 and
    July 1, 2006 and the results of its operations and its cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    July 1, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related combined and consolidated financial statements.
    These financial statements and financial statement schedule are
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
    We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
    the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
    the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to
    Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements

July 3, 2004, July 2, 2005 and July 1, 2006

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

(1)

Background

On February 10, 2005, Sara Lee Corporation (“Sara
    Lee”) announced an overall Transformation Plan to drive
    long-term growth and performance, which included spinning off
    Sara Lee’s apparel business in the Americas and Asia,
    referred to as Branded Apparel Americas and Asia within these
    Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements. The
    Transformation Plan announcement followed the January 25,
    2005 announcement of Sara Lee’s intent to sell its European
    branded apparel business and private label business in the
    United Kingdom in separate transactions. The European branded
    apparel business was subsequently sold on February 6, 2006.
    In connection with the spin off, Sara Lee incorporated
    Hanesbrands Inc., a Maryland corporation, to which it would
    transfer the assets and liabilities that relate to the Branded
    Apparel Americas and Asia business. Sara Lee completed the spin
    off of Hanesbrands on September 5, 2006. References to
    “Hanesbrands” or the “Company” refer to the
    Branded Apparel Americas and Asia business that were contributed
    to Hanesbrands Inc. in the spin off.

The Company is a consumer goods company with a portfolio of
    leading apparel brands, including

Hanes, Champion, Playtex,
    Bali, Just My Size, barely there and Wonderbra.

The Company
    designs, manufactures, sources and sells a broad range of
    apparel essentials products such as t-shirts, bras, panties,
    men’s underwear, kids’ underwear, socks, hosiery,
    casualwear and activewear.

The Company owns and operates production facilities in the U.S.,
    Canada, Latin America and Asia. Additional third-party sourcing
    arrangements exist in Latin America and Asia.

Cotton is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of
    many of the Company’s products. The costs for cotton yarn
    and cotton-based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating and
    often volatile cost of cotton, which is affected by weather,
    consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the
    relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of
    producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are
    generally unpredictable and beyond the control of the Company.
    In addition, fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum costs may
    also influence the prices of related items used in the
    Company’s business such as chemicals, dyes, polyester yarn
    and foam. Prices for raw materials fluctuate based upon supply
    and demand in the marketplace.

The Company’s products are sold through multiple
    distribution channels including mass merchants, national chains,
    traditional department stores, wholesale clubs, sporting goods
    retailers, food, drug and variety stores, off-price retailers,
    specialty stores and third-party embellishers. The
    Company’s sales are seasonal in that sales are typically
    higher in the first two quarters of each fiscal year (July to
    December). Socks, hosiery and fleece products generally have

Basis of
    Presentation

These Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements of
    Hanesbrands reflect the historical financial position, results
    of operations and cash flows of Sara Lee’s Branded Apparel
    Americas and Asia business during each respective period. These
    Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements do not include
    European branded apparel operations or a private label business
    in the U.K., which Sara Lee historically operated and managed
    separately from the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia business.
    Under Sara Lee’s ownership, certain Branded Apparel
    Americas and Asia operations were divisions of Sara Lee and not
    separate legal entities, while Branded Apparel Americas and Asia
    foreign operations were subsidiaries of Sara Lee. Because a
    direct ownership relationship did not exist among the various
    units comprising the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia business,
    Sara Lee’s parent companies’ equity investment is
    shown in lieu of stockholders’

equity in the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Within these financial statements, entities that are part of
    Sara Lee’s consolidated results of operations, but are not
    part of Branded Apparel Americas and Asia as defined above, are
    referred to as “related entities.” These historical
    Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements have been
    prepared using Sara Lee’s historical cost basis in the
    assets and liabilities and the results of Branded Apparel
    Americas and Asia. The financial information included herein may
    not reflect the consolidated financial position, operating
    results, changes in parent companies’ equity investment and
    cash flows of Branded Apparel Americas and Asia in the future,
    and does not reflect what they would have been had Branded
    Apparel Americas and Asia been a separate, stand alone entity
    during the periods presented. On September 5, 2006 Hanesbrands
    Inc. began operating as a separate independent publicly traded
    company.

Branded Apparel Americas and Asia historically has utilized the
    services of Sara Lee for certain functions. These services
    include providing working capital, as well as certain legal,
    finance, internal audit, financial reporting, tax advisory,
    insurance, global information technology, environmental matters
    and human resource services, including various corporate-wide
    employee benefit programs. The cost of these services has been
    allocated to Hanesbrands and included in the Combined and
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocations have been
    determined on the basis which the Sara Lee and Branded Apparel
    Americas and Asia businesses considered to be reasonable
    reflections of the utilization of services provided by Sara Lee.
    A more detailed discussion of the relationship with Sara Lee,
    including a description of the costs which have been allocated
    to the Branded Apparel Americas and Asia business, as well as
    the method of allocation, is included in note 20 to the
    Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to
    June 30. Fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006 included 53, 52,

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Combination
    and Consolidation

The Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements include the
    accounts of the Company, its controlled subsidiary companies
    which in general are majority owned entities, and the accounts
    of variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is
    deemed the primary beneficiary, as defined by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Interpretation
    No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

(FIN 46) and related interpretations. Excluded
    from the accounts of the Company are Sara Lee entities which
    during the periods presented maintained legal ownership of
    certain of the Company’s divisions (Parent Companies). The
    results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are
    included in the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements
    from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the date of
    disposal. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated in consolidation.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, which addresses
    consolidation by business enterprises of VIEs that either:
    (1) do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to
    permit the entity to finance its activities without additional
    subordinated financial support, or (2) have equity
    investors that lack an essential characteristic of a controlling
    financial interest.

Throughout calendar 2003, the FASB released numerous proposed
    and final FASB Staff Positions (FSPs) regarding FIN 46,
    which both clarified and modified FIN 46’s provisions.
    In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46

(FIN 46-R),

which replaced FIN 46.

FIN 46-R

retains many of the basic concepts introduced in FIN 46;
    however, it also introduced a new scope exception for certain
    types of entities that qualify as a “business” as
    defined in

FIN 46-R,

revised the method of calculating expected losses and residual
    returns for determination of the primary beneficiary, included
    new guidance for assessing variable interests, and codified
    certain FSPs on FIN 46. The Company adopted the provisions
    of

FIN 46-R

in 2004.

    Combined and Consolidated Financial
    Statements—(Continued)

July 3, 2004, July 2, 2005 and July 1, 2006

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

The Company assessed its business relationship and the
    underlying contracts with certain vendors, as well as all other
    investments in businesses historically accounted for under the
    equity method, and determined that consolidation of certain VIEs
    was required.

In June 2002, the Company entered into a fixed supply contract
    with a third party sewing operation. The Company evaluated the
    contract, and although the Company had no equity interest in the
    business, it was determined that it was the primary beneficiary
    and beginning in 2004, the Company consolidated the business. In
    the first quarter of 2006, the terms of the supply contract
    changed and the operation no longer qualified for consolidation
    as a VIE. Beginning in 2005, the Company consolidated a second
    VIE, an Israeli manufacturer and supplier of yarn. The Company
    has a 49% ownership interest in the Israeli joint venture,
    however, based upon certain terms of the supply contract, the
    Company has a disproportionate share of expected losses and
    residual returns.

The effect of consolidating the above mentioned VIEs was the
    inclusion of $2,500 of total assets and $2,500 of total
    liabilities at July 3, 2004, the inclusion of $21,396 of
    total assets and $13,219 of total liabilities at July 2,
    2005, and the inclusion of $13,589 of total assets and $8,666 of
    total liabilities at July 1, 2006 on the Combined and
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In relation to the Company’s ownership of the Israeli joint
    venture, the Company reported a minority interest of $8,100 and
    $4,935 in the “Other noncurrent liabilities” line of
    the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets at July 2,
    2005 and July 1, 2006, respectively.

(b)

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of Combined and Consolidated Financial
    Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles requires management to make use of
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of
    assets and liabilities, certain financial statement disclosures
    at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
    amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
    Actual results could differ from these estimates.

(c)

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are
    translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at
    the respective balance sheet dates. Translation adjustments
    resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates are recorded as a
    separate component of other comprehensive income within parent
    companies’ equity. The Company translates the results of
    operations of its foreign operations at the average exchange
    rates during the respective periods. Gains and losses resulting
    from foreign currency transactions, the amounts of which are not
    material for any of the periods presented, are included in the
    “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line of
    the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Income.

(d)

Sales
    Recognition and Incentives

The Company recognizes sales when title and risk of loss passes
    to the customer. The Company records a reduction for returns and
    allowances based upon historical return experience. The Company
    earns royalty revenues through license agreements with
    manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate
    certain of the Company’s brands. The Company accrues
    revenue earned under these contracts based upon reported sales
    from the licensee. The Company offers a variety of sales
    incentives to resellers and consumers of its products,

Notes to
    Combined and Consolidated Financial
    Statements—(Continued)

July 3, 2004, July 2, 2005 and July 1, 2006

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

and the policies regarding the recognition and display of these
    incentives within the Combined and Consolidated Statements of
    Income are as follows:

Discounts,
    Coupons, and Rebates

The Company recognizes the cost of these incentives at the later
    of the date at which the related sale is recognized or the date
    at which the incentive is offered. The cost of these incentives
    is estimated using a number of factors, including historical
    utilization and redemption rates. Substantially all cash
    incentives of this type are included in the determination of net
    sales. The Company generally includes incentives offered in the
    form of free products in the determination of cost of sales.

Volume-Based
    Incentives

These incentives typically involve rebates or refunds of cash
    that are redeemable only if the reseller completes a specified
    number of sales transactions. Under these incentive programs,
    the Company estimates the anticipated rebate to be paid and
    allocates a portion of the estimated cost of the rebate to each
    underlying sales transaction with the customer. The Company
    generally includes these amounts in the determination of net
    sales.

Cooperative
    Advertising

Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to reimburse the
    reseller for a portion of the costs incurred by the reseller to
    advertise and promote certain of the Company’s products.
    The Company recognizes the cost of cooperative advertising
    programs in the period in which the advertising and promotional
    activity first takes place. The Company generally includes the
    costs of these incentives in the determination of net sales.

Fixtures
    and Racks

Store fixtures and racks are periodically provided to resellers
    to display Company products. The Company expenses the cost of
    these fixtures and racks in the period in which they are
    delivered to the resellers. The Company generally includes the
    costs of these amounts in the determination of net sales.

(e)

Advertising
    Expense

Advertising costs, which include the development and production
    of advertising materials and the communication of these
    materials through various forms of media, are expensed in the
    period the advertising first takes place. The Company recognized
    advertising expense in the “Selling, general and
    administrative expenses” caption in the Combined and
    Consolidated Statements of Income of $188,695 in 2004, $179,980
    in 2005 and $190,934 in 2006.

(f)

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Revenue received for shipping and handling costs is included in
    net sales and was $14,418 in 2004, $14,504 in 2005 and $20,405
    in 2006. Shipping costs, that comprise payments to third party
    shippers, and handling costs, which consist of warehousing costs
    in the Company’s various distribution facilities, were
    $246,353 in 2004, $246,770 in 2005 and $235,690 in 2006. The
    Company recognizes shipping, handling and distribution costs in
    the “Selling, general and administrative expenses”
    line of the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Income.

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

(g)

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
    less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. During the periods presented, a significant portion
    of our cash and cash equivalents were in the Company’s bank
    accounts that were part of Sara Lee’s global cash funding
    system. With respect to accounts in the Sara Lee global cash
    funding system, the bank had a right to offset the accounts of
    the Company against the other Sara Lee accounts.

(h)

Accounts
    Receivable Valuation

Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value.
    The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company’s
    best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables
    portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience,
    specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other
    currently available information.

(i)

Inventory
    Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
    determined by the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method for 96% of the Company’s
    inventories at July 1, 2006, and by the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method for the remainder. There was no
    difference between the FIFO and LIFO inventory valuation at
    July 3, 2004, July 2, 2005 or July 1, 2006.
    Rebates, discounts and other cash consideration received from a
    vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as
    reductions in the cost of the related inventory item, and are
    therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory
    item is sold.

(j)

Property

Property is stated at historical cost and depreciation expense
    is computed using the straight-line method over the lives of the
    assets. Machinery and equipment is depreciated over periods
    ranging from 3 to 25 years and buildings and building
    improvements over periods of up to 40 years. Additions and
    improvements that substantially extend the useful life of a
    particular asset and interest costs incurred during the
    construction period of major properties are capitalized. Repairs
    and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or
    disposition of a property element, the cost and related
    accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts.

Property is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Such events include significant adverse changes in
    the business climate, several periods of operating or cash flow
    losses, forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation
    that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its
    useful life. Recoverability of property is evaluated by a
    comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to
    future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by
    the asset or asset group. If these comparisons indicate that an
    asset is not recoverable, the impairment loss recognized is the
    amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
    estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for
    assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amount of
    those assets is depreciated over its remaining useful life.
    Restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is not
    permitted under U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

(k)

Trademarks
    and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

The primary identifiable intangible assets of the Company are
    trademarks and computer software. Identifiable intangibles with
    finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives are
    not amortized. The estimated useful life of a finite-lived
    intangible asset is based upon a number of factors, including
    the effects

F-11


HANESBRANDS

Notes to
    Combined and Consolidated Financial
    Statements—(Continued)

July 3, 2004, July 2, 2005 and July 1, 2006

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

of demand, competition, expected changes in distribution
    channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to
    obtain future cash flows. Finite-lived trademarks are being
    amortized over periods ranging from 5 to 30 years, while
    computer software is being amortized over periods ranging from 2
    to 10 years.

Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization
    are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that
    used in evaluating elements of property. Identifiable intangible
    assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment
    at least annually and as triggering events occur. The impairment
    test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to
    amortization consists of comparing the fair value of the
    intangible asset to its carrying amount. An impairment loss is
    recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds
    the fair value of the asset. In assessing fair value, management
    relies on a number of factors to discount anticipated future
    cash flows including operating results, business plans and
    present value techniques. Rates used to discount cash flows are
    dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point
    in time. There are inherent uncertainties related to these
    factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the
    analysis of intangible asset impairment.

(l)

Goodwill

Goodwill is the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the
    fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
    business combination. When a business combination is completed,
    the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to the
    reporting unit or units of the Company given responsibility for
    managing, controlling and generating returns on these assets and
    liabilities. Reporting units are generally business components
    one level below the operating segment for which discrete
    financial information is available and reviewed by segment
    management. In many instances, all of the acquired assets and
    assumed liabilities are assigned to a single reporting unit and
    in these cases all of the goodwill is assigned to the same
    reporting unit. In those situations in which the acquired assets
    and liabilities are allocated to more than one reporting unit,
    the goodwill to be assigned to each reporting unit is determined
    in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill recognized in
    a business combination is determined.

Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is assessed for
    impairment at least annually and as triggering events occur. The
    annual review is performed at the end of the second quarter of
    each fiscal year. Recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using
    a two-step process. The first step involves comparing the fair
    value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying
    value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
    step of the process involves comparing the implied fair value to
    the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit. If
    the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds
    the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is
    recognized in an amount equal to such excess.

In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to
    estimate the fair values of the reporting units. In making this
    assessment, management relies on a number of factors to discount
    anticipated future cash flows including operating results,
    business plans and present value techniques. Rates used to
    discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the
    cost of capital at a point in time. There are inherent
    uncertainties related to these factors and management’s
    judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.

(m)

Investments
    in Affiliates

The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its
    investments in and earnings or losses of affiliates that it does
    not control but over which it does exert significant influence.
    The Company considers whether the fair values of any of its
    equity method investments have declined below their carrying
    value whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that recorded values may not be recoverable. If the
    Company considered any such decline to be other than temporary
    (based on various factors, including

historical financial results, product development activities and
    the overall health of the affiliate’s industry), a
    write-down would be recorded to estimated fair value.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Sara Lee has various stock option, employee stock purchase and
    stock award plans in which employees of the company participated
    during the periods presented and maintained available shares for
    future grant in the form of options, restricted shares or stock
    appreciation rights to company employees and other employees of
    Sara Lee.

On July 3, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R))
    using the modified prospective method. SFAS No. 123(R)
    requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services
    received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon
    the grant date fair value of those awards. Under the modified
    prospective method of adopting SFAS No. 123(R), the
    Company recognized compensation cost for all share-based
    payments granted after July 3, 2005, plus any awards
    granted to employees prior to July 3, 2005 that remained
    unvested at that time. Under this method of adoption, no
    restatement of prior periods is required. The cumulative effect
    of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) was immaterial in 2006.

Prior to July 3, 2005, the Company recognized the cost of
    employee services received in exchange for Sara Lee equity-based
    instruments in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” (APB No. 25). APB No. 25 required
    the use of the intrinsic value method, which measures
    compensation cost as the excess, if any, of the quoted market
    price of the stock over the amount the employee must pay for the
    stock. Compensation expense for substantially all equity-based
    awards was measured under APB No. 25 on the date the awards
    were granted. Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense has
    been recognized for stock options, replacement stock options and
    shares purchased by our employees under the Sara Lee Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (Sara Lee ESPP) during the years prior to
    2006. Compensation expense was recognized under APB No. 25
    for the cost of Sara Lee restricted share unit (RSU) awards
    granted to employees during the years prior to 2006.

A substantial portion of these RSUs vest solely upon continued
    future service to Sara Lee. The cost of these awards is
    determined using the fair value of shares on the date of grant,
    and compensation is recognized ratably over the period during
    which the employees provide the requisite service to Sara Lee.

A small portion of RSUs vest based upon continued future
    employment and the achievement of certain defined performance
    measures. The cost of these awards is determined using the fair
    value of the shares awarded at the end of the performance
    period. At interim dates, Sara Lee determines the expected
    compensation expense using the estimated number of shares to be
    earned and the change in the market price of the shares from the
    beginning to the end of the period.

During 2004 and 2005, had the cost of employee services received
    in exchange for equity instruments been recognized based on the
    grant-date fair value of those instruments in accordance with
    the provisions of

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes are prepared on a separate return basis as if the
    Company had been a group of separate legal entities. As a
    result, actual tax transactions that would not have occurred had
    the Company been a separate entity have been eliminated in the
    preparation of these Combined and Consolidated Financial
    Statements. In the periods presented, there was no formal tax
    sharing agreement between the Company and Sara Lee.

Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of
    temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
    using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences
    are expected to reverse. Given continuing losses in certain
    jurisdictions in which the Company operates on a separate return
    basis, a valuation allowance has been established for the full
    value of the net deferred tax assets in these specific
    locations. Net operating loss carryforwards, charitable
    contribution carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards have
    been determined in these Combined and Consolidated Financial
    Statements as if the Company had been a group of legal entities
    separate from Sara Lee, which results in different carryforward
    amounts than those shown by Sara Lee. Sara Lee periodically
    estimates the probable tax obligations using historical
    experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments. There
    are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax
    regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company transacts
    business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time
    may change based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as
    changes to or further interpretations of regulations. The
    Company adjusts its income tax expense in the period in which
    these events occur. If such changes take place, there is a risk
    that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period.

(p)

Financial
    Instruments

The Company uses financial instruments, including forward
    exchange, option and swap contracts, to manage its exposures to
    movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
    commodity prices. The use of these financial instruments
    modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce
    the risk or cost to the Company. The Company does not use
    derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged
    derivative contracts.

The Company formally documents its hedge relationships,
    including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged
    items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies
    for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes
    linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific
    assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted
    transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at
    inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the
    derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
    effective in

offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the
    hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be
    a highly effective hedge, or if the anticipated transaction is
    no longer likely to occur, the Company discontinues hedge
    accounting, and any deferred gains or losses are recorded in the
    “Selling, general and administrative expenses” of the
    Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivatives are recorded in the Combined and Consolidated
    Balance Sheets at fair value in other assets and other
    liabilities. The fair value is based upon either market quotes
    for actively traded instruments or independent bids for
    nonexchange traded instruments.

On the date the derivative is entered into, the Company
    designates the type of derivative as a fair value hedge, cash
    flow hedge, net investment hedge or a natural hedge, and
    accounts for the derivative in accordance with its designation.

Natural
    Hedge

A derivative used as a hedging instrument whose change in fair
    value is recognized to act as an economic hedge against changes
    in the values of the hedged item is designated a natural hedge.
    For derivatives designated as natural hedges, changes in fair
    value are reported in earnings in the “Selling, general and
    administrative expenses” line of the Combined and
    Consolidated Statements of Income. Forward exchange contracts
    are recorded as natural hedges when the hedged item is a
    recorded asset or liability that is revalued in each accounting
    period, in accordance with SFAS No. 52,

Foreign
    Currency Translation.

Cash Flow
    Hedge

A hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of
    cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset
    or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge. The effective
    portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative that is
    designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in the
    “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” line of the
    Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. When the hedged item
    affects the income statement, the gain or loss included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is reported on the
    same line in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Income
    as the hedged item. In addition, both the fair value of changes
    excluded from the Company’s effectiveness assessments and
    the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of
    derivatives used as cash flow hedges are reported in the
    “Selling, general and administrative expenses” line in
    the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Income.

Business
    Acquisitions

All business acquisitions have been accounted for under the
    purchase method. Cash, the fair value of other assets
    distributed, securities issued unconditionally, and amounts of
    consideration that are determinable at the date of acquisition
    are included in determining the cost of an acquired business.

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company acquired a
    domestic yarn and textile production company for $2,436 in cash
    and the assumption of $84,000 of debt. The fair value of the
    assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, approximated the
    purchase price based upon preliminary valuations and no goodwill
    was recognized as a result of the transaction. In 2005,
    purchases from the acquired business accounted for approximately
    18% of the Company’s total cost of sales. Following the
    acquisition, substantially all of the yarn and textiles produced
    by the acquired business will be used in products produced by
    the Company.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Accounting
    for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes: An Interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109

(FIN No. 48). This
    interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements
    in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN No. 48
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement principles
    for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax
    positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. This
    interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006 and as such, the Company will adopt
    FIN No. 48 in 2008. We are currently assessing the
    impact the adoption of FIN No. 48 will have on our
    consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Sara Lee has various stock option, employee stock purchase and
    stock award plans in which employees of the company participated
    during the periods presented and maintained available shares for
    future grant in the form of options, restricted shares or stock
    appreciation rights to company employees and other employees of
    Sara Lee.

On July 3, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
    Statement SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified
    prospective method. SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies
    to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange
    for awards of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair
    value of those awards. Under the modified prospective method of
    adopting SFAS No. 123(R), the Company recognized
    compensation cost for all share-based payments granted after
    July 3, 2005, plus any awards granted to employees prior to
    July 3, 2005 that remained unvested at that time. Under
    this method of adoption, no restatement of prior periods is
    required. The cumulative effect of adopting
    SFAS No. 123(R) was immaterial in 2006.

Prior to July 3, 2005, the Company recognized the cost of
    employee services received in exchange for Sara Lee equity-based
    instruments in accordance with APB No. 25.
    APB No. 25 required the use of the intrinsic value
    method, which measures compensation cost as the excess, if any,
    of the quoted market price of the stock over the amount the
    employee must pay for the stock. Compensation expense for
    substantially all equity-based awards was measured under APB
    No. 25 on the date the awards were granted. Under
    APB 25, no compensation expense has been recognized for
    stock options, replacement stock options and shares purchased by
    our employees under the Sara Lee ESPP during the years prior to
    2006. Compensation expense was recognized under the provisions
    of APB 25 for the cost of Sara Lee RSU awards granted to
    executives during the years prior to 2006.

(a)

Stock
    Options

The exercise price of each stock option equals or exceeds the
    market price of Sara Lee’s stock on the date of grant.
    Options can generally be exercised over a maximum term of
    10 years. Options generally vest ratably over three years.
    Under certain Sara Lee stock option plans, an active employee
    could receive a replacement stock option equal to the number of
    shares surrendered upon a

stock-for-stock

exercise. The exercise price of the replacement option was 100%
    of the market value at the date of exercise of the original
    option, and the replacement option remains exercisable for the
    remaining term of the original option. Replacement stock options
    generally vest six months from the grant date. Beginning in
    2006, Sara Lee discontinued the granting of replacement stock
    options. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on
    the

The Company uses historical volatility for a period of time that
    is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine
    volatility assumptions. The Company discontinued the granting of
    replacement options after the start of 2006. As a result of this
    change, the Company utilized the simplified method outlined in
    SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 to estimate
    expected lives for options granted during the period.

    $40,763 and $2,008, respectively. As of July 1, 2006, the
    Company had no unrecognized compensation expense related to
    stock option plans. The weighted average fair value of
    individual options granted during 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $3.81,

Sara
    Lee Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Sara Lee ESPP)

The Sara Lee ESPP permits eligible full-time employees to
    purchase a limited number of shares of Sara Lee’s common
    stock. Under the plan, Sara Lee sold 530,319, 448,846 and
    228,705 shares to company employees in 2004, 2005 and 2006,
    respectively. Until November 2005, the plan allowed the purchase

shares by U.S. participants at 85% of market value. Current
    purchases under the Sara Lee ESPP plan (by
    U.S. participants) are at the fair value of the shares.
    Compensation expense has been calculated for the fair value of
    the employees’ purchase rights using the Black-Scholes
    model. Assumptions include an expected life of


/


of a year and weighted average risk-free interest rates of 1.0%
    in 2004, 2.3% in 2005 and 3.7% in 2006. Other underlying
    assumptions are consistent with those used for Sara Lee’s
    stock option plans described above.

(c)

Stock
    Unit Awards

Restricted stock units (RSUs) are granted to certain employees
    to incent performance and retention over periods ranging from
    one to five years. Upon the achievement of defined goals, the
    RSUs are converted into shares of Sara Lee’s common stock
    on a

one-for-one

basis and issued to the employees. A substantial portion of all
    RSUs vest solely upon continued future service to the Company. A
    small portion of RSUs vest based upon continued future
    employment and the achievement of certain defined performance
    measures. The cost of these awards is determined using the fair
    value of the shares on the date of grant, and compensation is
    recognized over the period during which the employees provide
    the requisite service to the Company. A summary of the changes
    in the stock unit awards outstanding under Sara Lee’s
    benefit plans during the year ended July 1, 2006 is

    Restructuring Actions

During 2005, the Company approved a series of actions to exit
    certain defined business activities and to lower its cost
    structure. Each of these actions was to be completed within a

12-month

period after being approved. In 2005 these actions reduced
    income before income taxes by $54,012 and decreased the
    operating results of the Company’s business segments as
    follows: Innerwear—$21,679; Outerwear—$17,508;
    Hosiery—$3,219; International—$4,773; and
    Corporate—$6,833.

During 2006, certain of these actions were completed for amounts
    more favorable than originally estimated. As a result, costs
    previously accrued were adjusted and resulted in an increase of
    $2,700 to income before income taxes. The $2,700 consists of a
    credit for employee termination benefits and resulted from
    actual costs to settle the obligations being lower than
    expected. The adjustment is reflected in the “Charges for
    (income from) exit activities” line of the Combined and
    Consolidated Statement of Income and increased the operating
    results of the Company’s business segments as follows:
    Innerwear—$307; Outerwear—$350; Hosiery—$40;
    International—$1,638; and Corporate—$365.

After combining the amounts recognized in 2005 and 2006, the
    exit activities completed by the Company under these action
    plans reduced income before income taxes by a total of $51,312.
    This charge reflects the cost associated with terminating 1,012
    employees and providing them with severance benefits in
    accordance with existing benefit plans or local employment laws.
    The specific location of these employees is summarized in a
    table contained in this note. This cumulative charge is
    reflected in the “Charges for (income from) exit

    Restructuring Actions

During 2004, the Company approved a series of actions to exit
    certain defined business activities and lower its cost
    structure. In 2004, these actions reduced income before income
    taxes by $29,014 and decreased the operating results of the
    Company’s business segments as follows:
    Innerwear—$9,240; Outerwear—$5,706;
    Hosiery—$2,482; International—$9,042; and
    Corporate—$2,544.

During 2005, certain of these actions were completed for amounts
    more favorable than originally estimated. As a result, costs
    previously accrued were adjusted and resulted in an increase of
    $2,352 to income before income taxes. The $2,352 is composed of
    a credit for employee termination benefits and resulted from the
    actual costs to settle termination obligations being lower than
    expected and certain employees originally targeted for
    termination not being severed as originally planned. This
    adjustment is reflected in the “Charges for (income from)
    exit activities” line of the Combined and Consolidated
    Statement of Income and increased the operating results of the
    Company’s business segments as follows:
    Innerwear—$1,811; Outerwear—$71; Hosiery—$233;
    and International—$237.

During 2006, certain of these actions were completed for amounts
    more favorable than originally estimated. As a result, costs
    previously accrued were adjusted and resulted in an increase of
    $963 to income before income taxes. The $963 is composed of a
    credit for employee termination benefits and resulted from the
    actual costs to settle termination obligations being lower than
    expected. This adjustment is reflected in the “Charges for

increased the operating results of the Company’s business
    segments as follows: Innerwear—$548; Outerwear—$358;
    Hosiery—$17; and International—$40.

After combining the amounts recognized in 2004, 2005, and 2006,
    the exit activities completed by the Company under these action
    plans reduced income before income taxes by a total of $25,699.
    This charge reflects the cost associated with terminating 4,425
    employees and providing them with severance benefits in
    accordance with existing benefit plans or local employment laws.
    The specific location of these employees is summarized in a

Business
    Reshaping

Beginning in the second quarter of 2001, the Company’s
    management approved a series of actions to exit certain defined
    business activities. The final series of actions was approved in
    the second quarter of 2002. Each of these actions was to be
    completed in a

12-month

period after being approved. All actions included in this
    program have been completed. The impact of these actions on
    income before income taxes is described below.

During 2004, exit activities were completed for amounts that
    were more favorable than originally anticipated. As a result,
    the costs previously accrued were adjusted and resulted in an
    increase of $1,548 to income before income taxes. The $1,548
    consists of a $147 credit for employee termination benefits, a
    credit of $1,352 for noncancelable leases and other third-party
    obligations, and a credit of $49 for previously recognized
    losses on the disposal of property and equipment. The adjustment
    for severance benefits resulted from the actual costs to settle
    the termination benefits being lower than expected. The
    adjustment for noncancelable leases and other third-party
    obligations resulted from settling these liabilities for less
    than originally estimated. These adjustments are reflected in
    the “Charges for (income from) exit activities” line
    of

    the operating income of the Company’s business segments as
    follows: Innerwear—$1,336; Outerwear—$22;
    Hosiery—$62; and International—$128.

During 2005, certain noncancelable lease and other contractual
    obligations under this program were settled for amounts that
    were more favorable than originally anticipated. As a result,
    the costs previously accrued were adjusted and resulted in an
    increase of $133 to income before income taxes. This adjustment
    is reflected in the “Charges for (income from) exit
    activities” line of the Combined and Consolidated Statement
    of Income and increased the operating income of the Innerwear
    segment.

During 2006, certain pension termination and other contractual
    obligations under this program were settled for amounts that
    were more favorable than originally anticipated. As a result,
    the costs previously accrued were adjusted and resulted in an
    increase of $557 to income before income taxes. This adjustment
    is reflected in the “Charges for (income from) exit

Sale of
    Accounts Receivable

Historically, the Company participated in a Sara Lee program to
    sell trade accounts receivable to a limited purpose subsidiary
    of Sara Lee. The subsidiary, a separate bankruptcy remote
    corporate entity, is consolidated in Sara Lee’s results of
    operations and statement of financial position. This subsidiary
    held trade accounts receivable that it purchased from the
    operating units and sold participating interests in those
    receivables to financial institutions, which in turn purchased
    and received ownership and security interests in those
    receivables. During 2005, Sara Lee terminated its receivable
    sale program and no receivables were sold under this program at
    the end of 2005. The amount of receivables sold under this
    program was $22,313 at the end of 2004. Changes in the balance
    of receivables sold are a component of operating cash flow
    (change in trade receivables) with an offset to a change in
    “Due from related entities” in the Combined and
    Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. As collections reduced
    accounts receivable included in the pool, the operating units
    sold new receivables to the limited purpose subsidiary. The
    limited purpose subsidiary had the risk of credit loss on the
    sold receivables.

The proceeds from the sale of the receivables were equal to the
    face amount of the receivables less a discount. The discount was
    based on a floating rate and was accounted for as a cost of the
    receivable sale program. This cost has been included in
    “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the
    Combined and Consolidated Statements of Income. The calculated
    discount rate for 2004 and 2005 was 1.2%, resulting in
    aggregated costs of $4,981 and $4,020 in 2004 and 2005,
    respectively. The Company retained collection and administrative
    responsibilities for the participating interests in the defined

The Company maintained a

short-term non-revolving credit facility under which the Company
    could borrow up to 107 million Canadian dollars at a
    floating rate of interest that was based upon either the
    announced bankers acceptance lending rate plus 0.6% or the
    Canadian prime lending rate. Under the agreement, the Company
    had the option to borrow amounts for periods of time less than
    364 days. The facility expired at the end of the

364-day

period and the amount of the facility could not be increased
    until the next renewal date. During fiscal 2004 and 2005 the
    Company and the bank renewed the facility. At the end of fiscal
    2005, the Company had borrowings under this facility of $81,972
    at an interest rate of 3.16%. In 2006, the borrowings under this
    agreement were repaid at the end of the year and the facility
    was closed.

Total interest paid on third party debt instruments was $3,945,
    $4,041 and $2,588 in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

The Company is a party to various pending legal proceedings,
    claims and environmental actions by government agencies. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies

, the Company records a provision with respect
    to a claim, suit, investigation, or proceeding when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can reasonably be estimated. Any provisions are
    reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the
    impact and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and
    other information pertinent to the particular matter. The
    recorded liabilities for these items were not material to the
    Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in
    any of the years presented. Although the outcome of such items
    cannot be determined with certainty, the Company’s legal
    counsel and management are of the opinion that the final outcome
    of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    liquidity.

License
    Agreements

The Company is party to several royalty-bearing license
    agreements for use of third-party trademarks in certain of their
    products. The license agreements typically require a minimum
    guarantee to be paid either at the commencement of the
    agreement, by a designated date during the term of the agreement
    or by the end of the agreement period. When payments are made in
    advance of when they are due, the Company records a prepayment
    and amortizes the expense in the “Cost of sales” line
    of the Combined and Consolidated Income Statements uniformly
    over the guaranteed period. For guarantees required to be paid
    at the completion of the agreement, royalties are expensed
    through “Cost of sales” as the related sales are made.
    Management has reviewed all license agreements and concluded
    that these guarantees do not fall under Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards Interpretation No. 45

Reporting
    Requirements

, and accordingly, there are no liabilities
    recorded at inception of the agreements.

For fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company incurred
    royalty expense of approximately $9,570, $10,571 and $12,554,
    respectively.

July 3, 2004, July 2, 2005 and July 1, 2006

(dollars in thousands, except per share data)

The amortization expense for intangibles subject to amortization
    was $8,712 in 2004, $9,100 in 2005 and $9,031 in 2006. The
    estimated amortization expense for the next five years, assuming
    no change in the estimated useful lives of identifiable
    intangible assets or changes in foreign exchange rates is as
    follows: $6,894 in 2007, $5,851 in 2008, $5,436 in 2009, $5,135
    in 2010, and $5,135 in 2011.

During 2004, trademarks with a net book value of $8,880 were
    moved to the finite lived category from the indefinite lived
    category and at the end of the year, the remaining $7,500 of
    this trademarks carrying value was written off. The sales of
    products with this trademark were primarily to a single large
    retailer and during 2004 that retailer elected to simplify is
    offerings and no longer carry this product. After evaluating
    alternatives, the Company concluded that the carrying value of
    the trademark could not be recovered and the amount was written
    off and included in “Selling, general and administrative
    expenses” in the Combined and Consolidated Statements of
    Income.

No impairment charges were recognized in 2005 or 2006. However,
    as a result of the annual impairment review, the Company
    concluded that certain trademarks had lives that were no longer
    indefinite. As a result of this conclusion, trademarks with a
    net book value of $51,524 and $79,044 in 2005 and 2006,
    respectively, were moved from the indefinite lived category and
    amortization was initiated over a 30 year period.

Guarantees

Due to the historical relationship between Sara Lee and the
    Company, there are various contracts under which Sara Lee has
    guaranteed certain third-party obligations relating to the
    Company’s business. Typically, these obligations arise from
    third-party credit facilities guaranteed by Sara Lee and as a
    result of contracts entered into by the Company’s entities
    and authorized by Sara Lee, under which Sara Lee agrees to
    indemnify a third-party against losses arising from a breach of
    representations and covenants related to such matters as title
    to assets sold, the collectibility of receivables, specified
    environmental matters, lease obligations and certain tax
    matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by Sara Lee is
    conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the
    procedures specified in the contract, which procedures allow
    Sara Lee to challenge the other party’s claims. In
    addition, Sara Lee’s obligations under these agreements may
    be limited in terms of time

and/or

amount, and in some cases Sara Lee or the related entities may
    have recourse against third-parties for certain payments made by
    Sara Lee. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential
    amount of future payments under certain of these agreements, due
    to the conditional nature of Sara Lee’s obligations and the
    unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
    agreement. Historically, payments made by Sara Lee under these
    agreements have not been material, and no amounts are accrued
    for these items on the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Financial
    Instruments and Risk Management

(a)

Currency
    Swaps

The Company has issued certain foreign currency-denominated debt
    instruments to a related entity and utilizes currency swaps to
    reduce the variability of functional currency cash flows related
    to the foreign currency debt.

The Company records gains and losses on these derivative
    instruments using

mark-to-market

accounting. Under this accounting method, the changes in the
    market value of outstanding financial instruments are recognized
    as gains or losses in the period of change. All derivatives
    using

mark-to-market

accounting were settled in 2005.

The fair value of currency swaps is determined based upon
    externally developed pricing models, using financial data
    obtained from swap dealers.

The notional principal is the amount used for the calculation of

Forward
    Exchange and Option Contracts

The Company uses forward exchange and option contracts to reduce
    the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short-term
    foreign currency-denominated intercompany transactions, foreign
    currency-denominated product sourcing transactions, foreign
    currency-denominated investments and other known foreign
    currency exposures. Gains and losses on these contracts are
    intended to offset losses and gains on the hedged transaction in
    an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from
    fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The principal
    currencies hedged by the Company include the European euro,
    Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen.

The following table summarizes by major currency the contractual
    amounts of the Company’s forward exchange contracts in
    U.S. dollars. The bought amounts represent the net
    U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign
    currencies, and the sold amounts represent the net
    U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign
    currencies. The foreign currency amounts have been translated
    into a U.S. dollar equivalent value using the exchange rate
    at the reporting date. Forward exchange contracts mature on the
    anticipated cash requirement date of the hedged transaction,
    generally within one year.

    income of approximately $5,576 at the time the underlying hedged
    transactions are realized. During the years ended July 3,

    recognized expense of $0, $554 and $306, respectively, for hedge
    ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges. Amounts reported
    for hedge ineffectiveness are not included in accumulated other
    comprehensive loss and therefore, not included in the above

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Historically employees who meet certain eligibility requirements
    have participated in defined benefit pension plans sponsored by
    Sara Lee. These defined benefit pension plans include employees
    from a number of domestic Sara Lee business units. All
    obligations pursuant to these plans have historically been
    obligations of Sara Lee and as such, are not included on the
    Company’s Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
    annual cost of the Sara Lee defined benefit plans is allocated
    to all of the participating businesses based upon a specific
    actuarial computation which is followed consistently.

Additionally, the Company sponsors two noncontributory defined
    benefit plans, the Playtex Apparel, Inc. Pension Plan and the
    National Textiles L.L.C. Pension Plan, for certain qualifying
    individuals. Beginning in 2006, the Company assumed the National
    Textiles L.L.C. Pension Plan through the acquisition of National
    Textiles.

The annual expense incurred by the Company for these defined
    benefit plans is as follows:

Postretirement
    Health-Care and Life-Insurance Plans

Historically, employees who meet certain eligibility
    requirements have participated in postretirement health-care and
    life insurance plans sponsored by Sara Lee. These plans include
    employees from a number of domestic Sara Lee business units. The
    annual cost of the Sara Lee plans is allocated to all of the

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of

    $268,332, $269,633 and $47,127 respectively. The net change in
    the total valuation allowance for the years ended July 3,
    2004, July 2, 2005 and July 1, 2006 were $217, $1,301
    and ($222,506), respectively.

The valuation allowance relates in part to deferred tax assets
    established under SFAS No. 109 for loss carryforwards
    at July 3, 2004, July 2, 2005 and July 1, 2006 of
    $16,270, $18,116 and $21,123, respectively, and to foreign
    goodwill of $3,944 at July 3, 2004, $3,399 at July 2,
    2005 and $2,855 at July 1, 2006.

In addition, a $248,118 valuation allowance exists for capital
    losses resulting from the sale of U.S. apparel capital
    assets in 2001 and 2003. Of these capital losses ($224,969)
    expired unused at July 1, 2006. The remaining ($23,149)
    capital losses are due to expire unused in 2008 and have a 100%
    valuation allowance.

Since Sara Lee will retain the liabilities related to income tax
    contingencies for all periods prior to the spin off, such
    amounts have been reflected in the “Parent companies’
    equity investment” line of the Combined and Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
    management considers whether it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
    dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
    the periods in which those temporary differences become
    deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of
    deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and
    tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon
    the level of historical taxable income and projections for
    future taxable income over the periods which the

deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is
    more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of
    these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation
    allowances.

At July 1, 2006, the Company has net operating loss
    carryforwards of approximately $89,880 which will expire as
    follows:

The Company recognized a $50.0 million tax charge related
    to the repatriation of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to
    the U.S. in 2005.

In addition, the Company recognized a $31.6 million tax
    charge for extraordinary dividends associated with the American
    Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Act). On October 22, 2004, the
    President of the United States signed the Act which created a
    temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
    accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends
    received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign
    corporations.

At July 1, 2006, applicable U.S. federal income taxes
    and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on the
    accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected
    to be permanently reinvested. If these earnings had not been
    permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of approximately
    $52.9 million would have been recognized in the Combined
    and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Relationship
    with Sara Lee and Related Entities

During the periods presented, the Company participated in a
    number of corporate-wide programs administered by Sara Lee.
    These programs included participation in Sara Lee’s Global
    Cash Funding System, insurance programs, employee benefit
    programs, worker’s compensation programs, and tax planning
    services. As part of the Company’s participation in Sara
    Lee’s Global Cash Funding System, Sara Lee provided all
    funding used for working capital purposes or other investment
    needs. These funding amounts are reflected in these financial
    statements and described further below. Sara Lee has issued debt
    for general corporate purposes and this debt and related
    interest have not been allocated to these financial statements.
    The following is a discussion of the relationship with Sara Lee,
    the services provided and how they have been accounted for in
    the Company’s financial statements.

Allocation

The costs of certain services that were provided by Sara Lee to
    the Company during the periods presented have been reflected in
    these financial statements, including charges for services such
    as business insurance, medical insurance and employee benefit
    plans and allocations for certain centralized administration
    costs for treasury, real estate, accounting, auditing, tax, risk
    management, human resources and benefits administration. These
    allocations of centralized administration costs were determined
    using a proportional cost allocation method on bases that the
    Company and Sara Lee considered to be reasonable, including
    relevant operating profit, fixed assets, sales, and payroll.
    Allocated costs are included in the “Selling, general and
    administrative expenses” line of the Combined and
    Consolidated Income Statements and the “Parent
    companies’ equity investment” line of the Combined and
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount allocated for
    centralized administration costs by Sara Lee in 2004, 2005 and
    2006 were $32,568, $34,213 and $37,478, respectively. These
    costs represent management’s reasonable allocation of the
    costs incurred. However, these amounts may not be representative
    of the costs necessary for the Company to operate as a separate
    standalone company. The “Net transactions with parent
    companies” line item in the Combined and Consolidated
    Statements of Parent Companies’ Equity primarily reflects
    dividends paid to parent companies and costs paid by Sara Lee on
    behalf of the Company.

Global
    Cash Funding System

During the periods presented, the Company participated in Sara
    Lee’s Global Cash Funding System. Sara Lee maintains a
    separate program for domestic operating locations and foreign
    locations.

Domestic Cash Funding System

—In the Domestic Cash
    Funding System, the Company’s domestic operating locations
    maintained a bank account with a specific bank as directed by
    Sara Lee. These funding system bank accounts were linked
    together and were globally managed by Sara Lee. The Company
    recorded two types of transactions in the funding system bank
    account as follows—(1) cash collections from the
    Company’s operations were deposited into the account, and
    (2) any cash borrowings or charges which were used to fund
    operations were taken from the account. Cash collections
    deposited into this account generally included all cash receipts
    made by the operating locations. Cash borrowings made by the
    Company from the Sara Lee cash concentration system were used to
    fund operating expenses. Interest was not earned or paid on the
    domestic cash funding system account. A portion of cash in the
    Company’s bank accounts during the periods presented was
    part of the funding system utilized by Sara Lee where the bank
    had a right of offset for the Company accounts against other
    Sara Lee accounts.

The receivable or payable at the end of each period is reported
    in the “Funding receivable with parent companies” or
    “Funding payable with parent companies” line of the
    Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts were
    generally settled on a monthly basis, and therefore have been
    shown in current assets or liabilities on the Combined and
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. The “Net transactions with
    parent companies” line on the Combined and Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows primarily reflects the cash activity in
    the funding (receivable) payable with parent and cash activity
    in the “Parent companies’ equity investment” line
    in the balance sheet.

Foreign Cash Pool System

— The Company
    maintained a bank account with a bank selected by Sara Lee in
    each foreign operating location. Within each country, one Sara
    Lee entity is designated as the cash pool leader and the
    individual bank accounts that each subsidiary maintains were
    linked with the country’s cash pool leader account. During
    each day, under the cash pooling arrangement, each individual
    participant can either deposit funds into the cash pool account
    from the collection of receivables or withdraw funds from the
    account to fund working capital or other cash needs of the
    business. At the end of the day, the cash pool leader sweeps all
    cash balances in the country’s cash pool accounts into the
    cash pool leader’s account, or funds any overdrawn accounts
    so that each cash pool participant account has a zero balance at
    the end of the day. The cash pool leader controls all funds in
    the leader’s account. As cash is swept into or out of a
    cash pool account, an intercompany payable or receivable is
    established between the cash pool leader and the participant.
    The net receivable or payable balance in the intercompany
    account earns interest or pays interest at the applicable
    country’s market rate. The net interest income (expense)
    recognized on the cash pool intercompany account by the Company
    for 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $579, $84 and ($1,092),
    respectively. At the end of 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Company
    reported the cash pool balances of $42,913, $14,458 and $1,109,
    respectively, in the “Due from related entities” line
    and $49,970, $40,740 and $39,739, respectively, in the “Due
    to related entities” line of the Combined and Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Sara Lee and the Company did not intend on
    repaying any of these outstanding amounts upon completion of the
    spin off and therefore these amounts are shown in current assets
    or liabilities on the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(d)

Intercompany
    Loans

During the periods presented, certain of the Company’s
    divisions had various short-term loans to and from Sara Lee and
    other parent companies. The purpose of these loans was to
    provide funds for certain working capital or other capital and
    operating requirements of the business. These loans maintained
    fixed interest rates ranging from 1.32% to 5.60%, 1.8% to 5.60%,
    3.60% to 5.66% at July 3, 2004, and July 2, 2005 and
    July 1, 2006, respectively. The balances are reported in
    the short-term “Notes payable to parent companies”
    line and the short-term “Notes receivable from parent
    companies” line in the Combined and Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. Sara Lee and the Company did not intend on repaying
    these outstanding

amounts upon the completion of the spin off and therefore have
    shown these amounts in current assets or liabilities on the
    Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other
    Transactions with Sara Lee Related Entities

During all periods presented, the Company’s entities
    engaged in certain transactions with other Sara Lee businesses
    that are not part of the Company, which included the purchase
    and sale of certain inventory, the exchange of services, and
    royalty arrangements involving the use of trademarks or other
    intangibles.

Transactions with related entities are summarized in the table

    lines of the Combined and Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest
    income and expense with related entities are reported in the
    “Interest income” and “Interest expense”
    lines of the Combined and Consolidated Statements of Income. The
    remaining balances included in these lines represent interest
    with third parties.

In addition to trade transactions, certain divisions within the
    Company had outstanding loans payable to related entities during
    the periods presented. The purpose of these loans was to provide
    additional capital to support operating requirements. These
    loans maintained fixed interest rates consistent with those
    related to intercompany loans with parent companies. The
    balances are reported in the “Notes payable to related
    entities” line of the Combined and Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

Business
    Segment Information

The Company has four operating segments, each of which is a
    reportable segment. These segments are organized principally by
    product category and geographic location. Management of each
    segment is responsible for the assets and operations of these
    businesses. The types of products and services from which each
    reportable segment derives its revenues are as follows:

•

Innerwear sells basic branded products that are replenishment in
    nature under the product categories of women’s intimate
    apparel, men’s underwear, kids’ underwear, sleepwear
    and socks.

•

Outerwear sells basic branded products that are seasonal in
    nature under the product categories of casualwear and activewear.

•

Hosiery sells legwear products in product categories such as
    panty hose and knee highs.

•

International relates to the Asia, Canada and Latin America
    geographic locations which sell products that span across each
    of the Company’s reportable segments.

The Company’s management uses operating segment income,
    which is defined as operating income before general corporate
    expenses and amortization of trademarks and customer
    relationship intangibles, to evaluate segment performance and
    allocate resources. Management believes it is appropriate to
    disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business
    performance and trends of the various business segments.

Subsequent
    Events

On August 7, 2006, Sara Lee approved the distribution
    ratio, record date and distribution date for the spin off. Sara
    Lee completed the spin off on September 5, 2006 by
    distributing the Company’s common stock in a pro rata
    dividend to Sara Lee shareholders. Sara Lee shareholders
    received one share of Hanesbrands common stock for every eight
    shares of Sara Lee common stock held as of the close of business
    on August 18, 2006. Sara Lee’s distribution of the
    Company’s common stock occurred on September 5, 2006.
    Shareholders received a cash payment for fractional shares they
    would otherwise have received, after making appropriate
    deductions for any required tax withholdings. All of the
    Company’s shares owned by Sara Lee were distributed to Sara
    Lee shareholders.

In August 2006, Sara Lee received a private letter ruling from
    the Internal Revenue Service that the spin off will qualify as a
    tax-free distribution under U.S. tax rules.

In connection with the spin off, on September 5, 2006, the
    Company made a one-time payment of $2.4 billion to Sara
    Lee, which was funded by new debt of $2.6 billion.
