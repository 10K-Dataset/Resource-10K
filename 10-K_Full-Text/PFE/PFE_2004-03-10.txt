PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Pfizer Inc. (which may be referred to as

Pfizer, the Company, we

,

us

or

our

) is a research-based, global pharmaceutical company. We discover, develop,
manufacture and market leading prescription medicines for humans and animals as
well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products.

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on
June 2, 1942.

We acquired Warner-Lambert Company (Warner-Lambert) on June 19, 2000. The
acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests. In accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), we restated all
consolidated financial statements of Pfizer for periods prior to the
acquisition to include the results of operations and financial position of
Warner-Lambert as if we had always been merged.

We acquired Pharmacia Corporation (Pharmacia) on April 16, 2003. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. In accordance with GAAP, we did
not restate our results of operations and financial position to reflect the
historical results of operations and financial position of Pharmacia.

We completed the acquisition of Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. on February
10, 2004, for $1.3 billion in cash. The acquisition is being accounted for as a
purchase. Esperion is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of
high density lipoprotein (HDL)-targeted (“good cholesterol”) therapies for the
treatment of cardiovascular disease.

Business Segments

We operate in three business segments: Pharmaceutical, Consumer Healthcare
and Animal Health. In prior years, we had two business segments:
Pharmaceutical, consisting principally of our human pharmaceutical and animal
health businesses, and Consumer Products. We have restated our segment
information for prior years to conform to the current segment structure.

We also operate several other businesses, including the manufacture of
empty soft-gelatin capsules, contract manufacturing, bulk pharmaceutical
chemicals and diagnostics. Due to the size of these businesses, they are
grouped in and their results and assets are included in the “Corporate/Other”
category of our segment information. On January 19, 2004, we announced that we
have agreed to sell for $575 million in cash our in-vitro allergy and
autoimmune diagnostic testing business, which we acquired as part of Pharmacia
in April 2003. This sale is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to
close in the first half of 2004.

Comparative segment revenues, profits and related financial information
for 2003, 2002 and 2001 are presented in the table captioned

Segment

in Note 21
to our consolidated financial statements,

Segment, Geographic and Revenue
Information,

on page 52 of our 2003 Financial Report. Tables captioned

Percentage Change in Revenues

and

Percentage Change in Geographic Revenues

on
page 7 of our 2003 Financial Report present additional segment information. The
information from those sections of our 2003 Financial Report is incorporated by
reference in this 2003 Form 10-K.

Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries where we
operate. In the U.S., the principal authority regulating our operations is the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy
of the products we offer, our research quality, our manufacturing processes and
our promotion and advertising. Similar regulations exist in most other
countries, and in many countries the government also regulates our prices. See

Government Regulation and Price Constraints

below.

Pharmaceutical Segment

Our Pharmaceutical business is the largest in the world. This segment
includes treatments for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, central nervous
system disorders, arthritis and pain, infectious and respiratory diseases,
urogenital conditions, cancer, eye disease, endocrine disorders and allergies.
In 2003, Pharmaceutical revenues increased 40%, to $39.6 billion, due in large
part to the inclusion of legacy Pharmacia products as well as strong
performances by many legacy Pfizer products and the favorable impact of foreign
exchange. Revenues from this segment contributed 88% of our total revenues in
2003 and 87% in each of 2002 and 2001. We recorded product sales of more than
$1 billion for each of nine pharmaceutical products in 2003. Those nine
products -

Lipitor, Norvasc, Zoloft, Neurontin, Zithromax, Celebrex, Viagra,
Zyrtec

and

Diflucan

- represented 70% of Pharmaceutical revenues in 2003. In
addition, in 2003,

Xalatan/Xalcom

became the first ophthalmic medicine to
achieve $1 billion in annual sales (including 2003 sales prior to our
acquisition of Pharmacia in April). A table captioned

Consumer Healthcare Segment

Our Consumer Healthcare business is one of the largest in the world. We
market many of the world’s best-known OTC medications for oral care, upper
respiratory health, tobacco dependence, gastrointestinal health, skin care, eye
care and hair growth.

In 2003, Consumer Healthcare revenues increased 20%, to $3 billion,
primarily due to the inclusion of legacy Pharmacia products as well as the
strong performance of

Listerine

mouthwash and the favorable impact of foreign
exchange. Revenues from this segment contributed 7% of our total revenues in
2003 and 8% in each of 2002 and 2001.

Consumer Healthcare’s principal products include:

Consumer Healthcare can extend the life of some of our prescription
medications by converting them to OTC medications. For example,

Nicorette,
Benadryl, Sudafed

and

Zantac 75

were all previously prescription products. As
market conditions permit, and when we have necessary approval from drug
regulatory authorities, we plan to pursue similar launches for other products.

Animal Health Segment

Our Animal Health business is the largest in the world. We discover,
develop and sell products for the prevention and treatment of diseases in
livestock and companion animals. In 2003, Animal Health revenues increased 43%,
to $1.6 billion, mainly due to the inclusion of legacy Pharmacia products as
well as strong performances by many legacy Pfizer products and the favorable
impact of foreign exchange. Revenues from this segment contributed 3.5% of our
total revenues in each of 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Among the products we market are parasiticides, anti-inflammatories,
vaccines, antibiotics and related medicines, including the products discussed
below.



Parasiticides constitute the largest segment of the animal health market
for companion animals, consisting mainly of medicines for the control of
parasites such as fleas and heartworm. Our product,

Revolution

, is our
largest-selling parasiticide for companion animals.

Rimadyl

relieves pain and inflammation associated with canine
osteoarthritis and soft tissue orthopedic surgery.

Rimadyl

is the only
arthritis pain medication prescribed by veterinarians available in chewable
tablets and regular caplets and in an injectable formulation.

Clavamox/Synulox

is an antibiotic for dogs and cats.

Our vaccine portfolio for livestock is extensive and includes

RespiSureOne/StellamuneOne,

a single-dose vaccine used to prevent pneumonia in
swine, and

Bovi-Shield Gold,

a reproductive and respiratory cattle vaccine.

Dectomax

injectable and pour-on formulations remove and control internal
and external parasites in beef cattle.

Naxcel/Excenel RTU

is an antibiotic used to treat respiratory and internal
infections in cattle and swine.

On December 15, 2003, we announced that Animal Health has agreed to
acquire CSL Animal Health, a division of CSL Limited of Melbourne, Australia,
for $126 million. This acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approvals
and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2004, will enhance our
presence in Australia’s animal health marketplace.

Research and Product Development

Innovation by our research and development operations is very important to
the Company’s success. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market
innovative products that address major unmet medical needs. This goal has been
supported by our substantial research and development investments. We spent
$7.1 billion in 2003, $5.2 billion in 2002 and $4.8 billion in 2001 on research
and development.

We conduct research internally and also through contracts with third
parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies
and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms. We also seek out innovative
technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or
development processes or projects as well as our product lines through
acquisition or through licensing or other arrangements.

Drug discovery and development is time consuming, expensive and
unpredictable. On average, only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds
discovered by researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough
to become an approved medicine. The process from early discovery to development
to regulatory approval can take more than ten years. Drug candidates can fail
at any stage of the process. Candidates may not receive regulatory approval
even after many years of research.

We believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the
number of pharmaceutical compounds we have in all stages of development. We
currently are working on approximately 225 projects in development, including
approximately 130 new molecular entities and 95 product-line extensions. In
addition, we have more than 400 projects in discovery research. In recent
years, our discovery scientists have delivered dozens of new chemical compounds
to early development. While these new candidates may or may not eventually
receive regulatory approval, new drug candidates entering development are the
foundation for future products.

In addition to discovering and developing new products, our research
operations add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness
and by discovering new uses for them. In 2003, for example, the FDA approved
the additional use of

Zoloft

for the treatment of social anxiety disorder.

Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as
well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the
heading

Product Developments

on pages 10
through 12 of our 2003 Financial Report. That information is incorporated
by reference.

Our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research
and development. In addition, the consolidation that has occurred in our
industry has created companies with substantial



research and development
resources. The extent to which our competitors are successful in their research
could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product
obsolescence.

International Operations

We have significant operations outside the United States. They are
conducted both through our subsidiaries and through distributors, and involve
the same business segments - Pharmaceutical, Consumer Healthcare and Animal
Health - as our U.S. operations.

Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $18.3 billion accounted for
40.6% of our total revenues in 2003. Revenues exceeded $500 million in each of
ten countries outside the U.S. in 2003. The U.S. was the only country to
contribute more than 10% of our total revenues. Japan is our second-largest
national market, with 5.9% of our revenues in 2003, 6.1% of our revenues in
2002 and 6.2% of our revenues in 2001.

For a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues, see the
table captioned

Geographic

in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements,

Segment, Geographic and Revenue Information,

on page 52 of our 2003 Financial
Report and the table captioned

Percentage Change in Geographic Revenues

on page
7 of our 2003 Financial Report. Those tables are incorporated by reference.

Our international businesses are subject, in varying degrees, to a number
of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. These include
currency fluctuations; capital and exchange control regulations; expropriation
and nationalization; and other restrictive government actions. Our
international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints,
including laws on pricing or reimbursement for use of products. See

Government
Regulation and Price Constraints

below for discussion of these matters.

Depending on the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign
currency values can increase or reduce the reported dollar value of our net
assets and results of operations. In 2003, revenues were favorably impacted by
foreign exchange, as currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar increased
our reported revenues in many countries. While we cannot predict with certainty
future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us, we
attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various
financial instruments. See the discussion under Note 5-D to our consolidated
financial statements,

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
on pages 35 through 37 of our 2003 Financial Report. That discussion is
incorporated by reference. Related information about valuation and risks
associated with such financial instruments in parts E and F of that same Note
is also incorporated by reference.

Marketing

In our global Pharmaceutical business, we promote our products to health
care providers such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants,
pharmacists, hospitals, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), Managed Care
Organizations (MCOs) and government agencies. Through our marketing
organizations, we explain the approved uses and advantages of our products to
health care providers. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through
direct-to-consumer print and television advertising. In addition, we sponsor
general advertising to educate the public about our innovative medical
research.

Our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations. Each
sales organization markets a distinct group of products. Our prescription
pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell
directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies.

We seek to gain access to health authority, PBM and MCO formularies (lists
of recommended or approved medicines and other products) and reimbursement
lists by demonstrating the qualities
and treatment benefits of our products. We also work with MCOs and PBMs to
assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that
help their medical treatment routines. For example, we sponsor a program
offered by the State of Florida Agency for Health Care Administration that is
designed to help manage chronic diseases among Florida’s Medicaid population.



Our Consumer Healthcare business primarily uses its own representatives to
directly promote its products, including marketing certain products directly to
professionals using a professional detail force. We also use print and
television consumer advertising and offer sales incentives such as coupons. Our
consumer products are sold through various retailers.

Our Animal Health business also uses its own sales organization to promote
its products. Its advertising and promotion are generally targeted to health
professionals, directly and through medical journals. Animal health and
nutrition products are sold through veterinarians, drug wholesalers,
distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users. Where
appropriate, these products are also marketed through print and television
advertising.

During 2003, sales to our three largest customers were as follows:

•

McKesson, Inc. - 18.4% of our total revenues;

•

Cardinal Health, Inc. - 14.1% of our total revenues; and

•

AmerisourceBergen Corporation - 12.0% of our total revenues.

Sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the Pharmaceutical segment.
Apart from these instances, none of our business segments is dependent on any
one customer or group of related customers.

Patents and Intellectual Property Rights

Our products are sold around the world under brand-name, logo and certain
product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material
importance. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the
mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered.
Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms.

We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents. These patents
cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses; pharmaceutical
formulations; product manufacturing processes; and intermediate chemical
compounds used in manufacturing.

Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to
the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded
by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the
country.

In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of material importance
to our businesses in the U.S. and most other countries. Based on current
product sales, and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by
others, the patent rights we consider significant in relation to our business
as a whole, together with the year in which the U.S. basic product patent
expires (including, where applicable, the additional six-month pediatric
exclusivity period), are those for the following drugs:

U.S. Basic

Product Patent

Drug

Expiration Year

Zithromax


Zoloft


Norvasc


Zyrtec


Aricept


Lipitor


Xalatan

See below

Viagra


Detrol


Celebrex


Bextra


Genotropin


Neurontin

See below

In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our
products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods
of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of further diseases or
conditions. Such patents may not protect the Company’s drug from generic drug
competition after the expiration of the basic product patent.



While the U.S. basic product patent relating to

Accupril

expired in 2003,
we have patents on particular formulations containing quinapril until 2007. The
U.S. basic product patent relating to

Diflucan

expired in January 2004. The FDA
has granted us pediatric exclusivity with respect to

Diflucan

, which extends
our marketing exclusivity for six months after the patent expiration date,
through July 29, 2004. The FDA’s grant of pediatric exclusivity is the subject
of a pending legal challenge. See Item 3,

Legal Proceedings

, below.

Zithromax

is patented by Pliva, a Croatian pharmaceutical company. The
drug is licensed exclusively to us by Pliva for sales and marketing in major
countries, and we purchase the compound in bulk crude form from Pliva.

Zyrtec

is patented by the Belgian company UCB S.A. and is licensed to us
for sales in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and South Africa. We copromote

Zyrtec

as a prescription medicine in the U.S. with a subsidiary of UCB S.A. and
have a license to sell

Zyrtec

under various trade names as an OTC medicine in
the other markets.

Aricept

is patented by Eisai Co., Ltd. We copromote

Aricept

with Eisai in
the U.S. and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the
drug in certain other countries.

Xalatan

is not protected by a basic product patent. However, we have
broadly patented ophthalmic formulations containing lantanoprost until 2011.

Genotropin

is patented by Novo Nordisk, which has granted us a
non-exclusive license to sell the drug in the U.S.

The U.S. basic product patent relating to

Neurontin

expired in 1994.
However, in April 2000, a U.S. patent was granted relating to stable
pharmaceutical compositions of

Neurontin

containing low levels of lactam
impurity. This patent expires in 2017. See Item 3,

Legal Proceedings

, below,
regarding the approval by the FDA of products that we believe infringe this
patent.

Other companies have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of
products that we believe infringe our patents covering, among other products,

Lipitor, Norvasc

,

Celebrex, Xalatan

and

Detrol

. Separately, we are defendants
in an action alleging patent infringement with respect to our sales of

Celebrex

and

Bextra

. See Item 3,

Legal Proceedings

, below.

We have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser
revenues.

The expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection
resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition
from generic products against the covered product and can result in a
significant reduction in sales of the pioneer product in a very short period.
In some cases, however, we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from
product manufacturing trade secrets; patents on uses for products; patents on
processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active
ingredients; patents for special formulations of the product or delivery
mechanisms; and conversion of the active ingredient to OTC products.

One of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside
the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection of our
products. Under international agreements in recent years, global protection of
intellectual property rights is improving. The General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws
to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a
ten-year transition period. A number of countries are doing this. We have
experienced significant growth in our businesses in some of those nations, and
our continued business expansion in those countries depends to a large degree
on further patent protection improvement.

Competition

Competition is intense in all of our businesses and includes many large
and small competitors. The principal means of competition vary among product
categories and business groups. However, efficacy, safety, patients’ and
customers’ ease of use and cost effectiveness are important factors for success
in all of our principal businesses.

Our human pharmaceutical business is the largest in the world. We compete
with other worldwide research-based drug companies, many smaller research
companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers.



We focus on unmet medical needs and therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis
on innovation has led to our multi-billion-dollar research and development
investments over the past decade.

In recent years, a comparison of the total cost of medical treatments
using pharmaceuticals versus alternative treatments for the same condition has
become an important basis of competition. MCOs and PBMs look to cost advantages
as well as medical benefits in making their drug formulary decisions.

Our pharmaceutical sales and marketing organization is a valuable
competitive asset. Our salespeople’s ability to reach medical professionals
with information about our products helps us respond to competitive efforts and
launch new products.

Our consumer healthcare business is one of the largest in the world.
However, many other companies, large and small, manufacture and sell one or
more products that are similar to our consumer healthcare products. Sources of
competitive advantage include product quality and efficacy, brand identity,
advertising and promotion, product innovation, broad distribution capabilities
and price. Significant expenditures for advertising, promotion and marketing
are generally required to achieve and maintain both consumer and trade
acceptance of consumer products.

While our animal health business is the largest in the world, many other
companies offer competitive products. Altogether, there are hundreds of
producers of animal health products throughout the world. The principal methods
of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product. They include
product innovation, quality, service, effective promotion to veterinary
professionals and consumers and price. We promote our products directly through
our sales representatives as well as through advertising.

Managed Care Organizations

The growth of MCOs in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitive
make-up of the health care marketplace. A substantial portion of the U.S.
population now participates in some version of managed care. Because of the
size of the patient population covered by MCOs, marketing of prescription drugs
to them and the PBMs that serve many of those organizations has become
important to our business.

MCOs can include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators,
health-maintenance organizations, alliances of hospitals and physicians and
other physician organizations. The purchasing power of MCOs has been increasing
in recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients. At the same
time, those organizations have been consolidating into fewer, even larger
entities. This enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us.

The growth of MCOs has increased pressure on drug prices. A major
objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce health care
expenditures. They typically use formularies, volume purchases and long-term
contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers. They use their
purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices. They also emphasize
primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at
doctors’ offices and clinics. Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most
expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed. Since the use of certain
drugs can prevent the need for hospitalization, professional therapy or even
surgery, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments for certain
diseases.

As discussed above in

Marketing

, MCOs and PBMs typically develop
formularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies can be based on
the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products. Due to their
generally lower
cost, generic medicines are often favored. The breadth of the products
covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many
formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of
particular medical problems. MCOs use a variety of means to encourage patients’
use of products listed on their formularies.

Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced
usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies
compete aggressively to have their products included. Where possible, companies



compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products, such as
greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower
overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate
fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on
price. We have been generally, although not universally, successful in having
our major products included on MCO formularies.

The impact of MCOs on drug prices and volumes may increase as the result
of their role in negotiating on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries in connection
with the recently enacted, limited out-patient drug benefit under Medicare, as
discussed below under

Government Regulation and Price Constraints

.

Another way we address the interests of MCOs is by developing
disease-management programs. These programs can be attractive to MCOs by
improving patient communications and compliance with dosage directions, which
are important for effective disease treatment. They can help MCOs address
various aspects of disease management, such as prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of certain diseases, including use of pharmaceutical products. This
comprehensive approach can improve the quality of care and lower costly
complications of chronic diseases. As noted above in

Marketing

, one such
program, which is sponsored by us and offered by the State of Florida Agency
for Health Care Administration, is designed to help manage chronic diseases
among Florida’s Medicaid population.

Generic Products

One of the biggest competitive challenges that we face in the U.S. and
that is growing internationally is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, we can lose the
major portion of sales of that product in a very short period. Generic
competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our
costs of conveying medical information about the product to the medical
community. In addition, the FDA approval process exempts generics from costly
and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy,
and allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the
pioneer product. Generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability
in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the pioneer product. This means that,
after we have borne the expenses of discovering, developing and testing a
medicine for safety and efficacy, obtaining regulatory approval and informing
the medical community about its therapeutic benefits, generic competitors can
market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our
patent and charge much less.

As noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs
often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the
use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their health care
programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and
in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been
rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to a
brand-name drug. The substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician
expressly forbids it.

Raw Materials

Raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the
ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these
materials are available from multiple sources. No serious shortages or delays
were encountered in 2003, and none are expected in 2004.

Government Regulation and Price Constraints

In the United States

General

. Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by
national, state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business.
Of particular importance is the FDA in the U.S. It has jurisdiction over our
human pharmaceutical business and administers requirements covering the
testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, advertising
and post-marketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products. The FDA also
regulates most of our consumer healthcare products and, along with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and



the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, our
animal health products.

In addition, we are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal
regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies, such as the Department of
Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of
Justice. Individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become
active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under
state consumer protection and false advertising laws.

We are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and
actions by these various regulatory bodies (see Item 3,

Legal Proceedings

,
below). Such actions may include product recalls, seizures and other civil and
criminal sanctions.

Medicare

. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the 2003 Medicare Act) was enacted. Under this
legislation, Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to obtain a
Medicare-endorsed, drug-discount card from an MCO, PBM or other private sector
provider beginning in the spring of 2004 and continuing through 2005. Then,
beginning in 2006, Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to purchase
prescription drug coverage with limited benefits from a private sector
provider. At this early stage, it is difficult to predict the impact of the
2003 Medicare Act on pharmaceutical companies. Usage of pharmaceuticals may
increase as the result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by the
partial reimbursement under Medicare. Such potential sales increases, however,
may be offset by increased pricing pressures due to the enhanced purchasing
power of the private sector providers that will negotiate on behalf of Medicare
beneficiaries.

In 2002, we implemented the Pfizer for Living Share Card program in order
to help address the issue of affordable access to health care for those most in
need. Through this program, low-income Medicare recipients without prescription
drug coverage can purchase 30-day prescriptions of any Pfizer prescription
medicine and of the copromoted product

Aricept

at many retail pharmacies for
$15. We remain committed to this or similar programs until Medicare
beneficiaries are eligible to purchase prescription drug coverage beginning in
2006.

Importation
of Drugs

. There is considerable political pressure to allow
the importation into the U.S. of prescription drugs that are manufactured
outside the U.S. and sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of
various foreign countries. In addition to raising safety concerns, such
importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the U.S. While the 2003
Medicare Act maintains the current prohibition on such imports, it would allow
importation from Canada if the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies
that such importation is safe and would result in savings to consumers. Before
the 2003 Medicare Act, federal law would have permitted importation of
medicines into the U.S. from a considerably larger group of developed
countries, provided the Secretary of Health and Human Services made the same
safety and cost-savings certifications.

Medicaid
and Related Matters

. In recent years, various proposals have been
offered at the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in
the Medicaid program. Driven by budget concerns, some states have implemented
and other states are considering price controls or patient-access constraints
on medicines under the Medicaid program. If changes are implemented under the
Medicaid program that restrict the access of a significant population of
patients to our innovative medicines, our business could be materially
affected. In addition, some states are considering price-control regimes that
would apply to all of their residents, regardless of
income, as well as various approaches to controlling pharmaceutical
marketing.

U.S. law requires us to give rebates to state Medicaid agencies based on
each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the Medicaid
program. Some states are seeking rebates in excess of the amounts required by
federal law, and there are federal legislative proposals to expand current
Medicaid rebates. We also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or
reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state
agencies and programs. See the discussion regarding rebates on page 9 of our
2003 Financial Report, which is incorporated by reference.



Hatch-Waxman
Act

. Under the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term
Restoration Act, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, if a generic drug company files
an abbreviated new drug application with the FDA and a research-based drug
company promptly files a lawsuit alleging that the generic product would
infringe one or more of its patents, approval of the abbreviated new drug
application by the FDA automatically is stayed for a period of up to 30 months
(but not beyond the expiration date of the patents). The 2003 Medicare Act
includes an amendment to the Hatch-Waxman Act providing that such 30-month
stays apply only to patents that are submitted to the FDA before the submission
of an abbreviated new drug application by a generic company. This provision has
the effect of preventing multiple stays when additional patents are issued
after an abbreviated new drug application has been filed. The amendment also
requires that agreements between research-based companies and generic drug
companies relating to either a brand-name drug or a generic drug be filed with
the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.

Outside the United States

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other
countries. In Europe and some other international markets, the government
provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates
pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the
government-sponsored health care system. This international patchwork of price
regulation has led to different prices and some third-party trade in our
products from markets with lower prices. Such trade exploiting price
differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher
prices.

Since 1998, the approval of new drugs across the EU is possible only using
the European Medicines Evaluation Agency’s (EMEA) mutual recognition or central
approval processes. The use of either of these procedures provides a more rapid
and consistent approval within the member states than was the case when the
approval processes were operating independently within each member state.
Further, Norway and Iceland are full participants in the EU central approval
processes. The addition of ten new member states to the EU in May 2004 will
extend the scope of these approval procedures. Since the EMEA does not have
jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in EU member states,
we will continue to deal with individual countries on such issues across the
enlarged EU.

Environmental Law Compliance

Most of our manufacturing and certain of our research operations are
affected by federal, state and local environmental laws. We have made, and
intend to continue to make, necessary expenditures for compliance with
applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past
industrial activity at certain sites (see Item 3,

Legal Proceedings

, below). As
a result, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2003 for the
clean-up of certain past industrial activity and for other environmental
protection purposes as follows:

•

environment-related capital expenditures - $45 million

•

other environment-related expenses - $209 million

While we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or
operating costs for environmental compliance, we do not believe they will have
a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position.

Tax Matters

The discussion of tax-related matters in Note 10 to our consolidated
financial statements,

Taxes on Income

, on pages 39 and 40 of our 2003 Financial
Report is incorporated by reference.

Employees

In our innovation-intensive business, our employees are vital to our
success. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. As of
December 31, 2003, we employed approximately 122,000 people in our operations
throughout the world.



Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results

(Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995)

Our disclosure and analysis in this 2003 Form 10-K and in our 2003 Annual
Report to Shareholders contain some forward-looking statements that set forth
anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. From time to
time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release
to the public as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give
our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. We have tried, wherever possible, to
identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will” and similar
expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial
performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future
actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or
results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal
proceedings, and financial results.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized,
although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions.
Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and
potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate,
actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated,
estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider
forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are
advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related
subjects in our 10-Q and 8-K reports to the SEC. Also note that we provide the
following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate
assumptions relevant to our businesses. These are factors that, individually or
in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially
from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as
permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should
understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion
of all potential risks or uncertainties.

• U.S. and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and
patient-access constraints impact our business, and our future results could be
affected by changes in such regulations. In the U.S., many pharmaceutical
products are subject to increasing pricing pressures. Such pressures may
increase as the result of the 2003 Medicare Act. On the other hand, usage of
pharmaceuticals also may increase due to the expanded access to medicines
afforded by the partial reimbursement under the 2003 Medicare Act. In addition, MCOs as well
as Medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price discounts.
Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may continue to
increase the use of MCOs. This may result in managed care’s influencing
prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population. In addition,
some states have implemented and other states are considering price controls or
patient-access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are
considering price-control regimes that
would apply to all of their residents, regardless of income. Other matters that
could be the subject of U.S. legislative or regulatory action affecting our
business include the importation of prescription drugs that are manufactured
outside the U.S. and sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of
various foreign countries and the involuntary approval of prescription
medicines for OTC use.

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other
countries. In Europe and some other international markets, the government
provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates
pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the
government-sponsored health care system. This international patchwork of price
regulation has led to different prices and some third-party trade in our
products from markets with lower prices. Such trade exploiting price
differences



between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher
prices.

As a result, it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of
operating results will continue.

• Competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge in the
U.S. and is growing internationally. Upon the expiration or loss of patent
protection for a product, we can lose the major portion of sales of that
product in a very short period. The U.S. basic product patent covering

Diflucan

expired in January 2004. The FDA has granted us pediatric exclusivity with
respect to

Diflucan

, which extends our marketing exclusivity through July 29,
2004, but the grant of pediatric exclusivity is subject to a pending legal
challenge by a generic manufacturer. The patents covering several of our other
medicines, including

Lipitor

,

Norvasc

,

Neurontin, Celebrex

,

Xalatan

and

Detrol

,
are being challenged by generic manufacturers.

• We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of
competitive products or their possible effect on our sales. Products that
compete with our drugs, including some of our best-selling medicines, are
launched from time to time. Launches of a number of competitive products have
occurred recently, and certain potentially competitive products are in various
stages of development, some of which have been filed for approval with the FDA
and with regulatory authorities in other countries.

• We recorded product sales of more than $1 billion for each of nine
pharmaceutical products in 2003:

Lipitor, Norvasc, Zoloft, Neurontin,
Zithromax, Celebrex, Viagra, Zyrtec

and

Diflucan.

Those products accounted for
61% of our 2003 revenues. In addition,

Xalatan/Xalcom

achieved more than $1
billion in annual sales in 2003 (including 2003 sales prior to our acquisition
of Pharmacia in April). If these or any of our other major products were to
become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection, material product
liability litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings,
publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from existing
competitive products, or if a new, more effective treatment should be
introduced, the impact on our revenues could be significant. As noted, patents
covering several of our best-selling medicines are the subject of pending legal
challenges.

• The discovery and development of new products as well as the development of
additional uses for existing products is very important to the success of the
Company. However, balancing current growth and investment for the future
remains a major challenge. Our ongoing investments in new product introductions
and in research and development for new products and existing product
extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth. This could produce higher
costs without a proportional increase in revenues.

• Risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to product-related
forward-looking statements. The outcome of the lengthy and complex process of
identifying new compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain.
There can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory
approval for new products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing
products. There also are many considerations that can affect marketing of
pharmaceutical products around the world. Regulatory delays, the inability to
successfully complete clinical trials, claims and concerns about safety and
efficacy, new discoveries, patent disputes and claims about adverse side
effects are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the realization of
research and development and product-related forward-looking statements.

• Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a
drug candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the
drug receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional
benefits that can help in the marketing, but they consume time and resources
and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval. We try to
plan clinical trials prudently, but there is no guarantee that a proper balance
of speed and testing will be made in each case. The quality of our decisions in
this area could affect our future results.

• 40.6% of our 2003 revenues derived from international operations, including
5.9% from Japan. These international-based revenues as well as our substantial
international assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency



exchange rate changes. In addition, our interest-bearing investments, loans and
borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest rates. These risks and
the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the section
entitled

Financial Risk Management

on pages 19 and 20 of our 2003 Financial
Report. For additional details, see Note 5-D to our consolidated financial
statements,

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

, on pages
35 through 37 of our 2003 Financial Report. Those sections of our 2003
Financial Report are incorporated by reference.

Notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes
in fiscal circumstances, we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency
and interest rates, inflation or other related factors affecting our
businesses.

• Our international operations also could be affected by changes in
intellectual property legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and
procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement
and marketing of products, as well as by unstable governments and legal
systems, inter-governmental disputes and possible nationalization.

• Difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing, including, but
not limited to, the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with
demand, or the failure to predict market demand for, or to gain market
acceptance of, approved products, could affect future results.

• Growth in costs and expenses, changes in product mix and the impact of
acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other
unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies, evaluation
of asset realization and organizational restructuring could affect future
results. Such risks and uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to
integrate and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from our
acquisition of Pharmacia.

• Our future results could be affected by changes in laws and regulations,
including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including
tax-rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations),
competition laws and environmental laws in the U.S. and other countries.

• Our future results could be affected by changes in business, political and
economic conditions, including the cost and availability of insurance, due to
the threat of future terrorist activity in the U.S. and other parts of the
world and related U.S. military action overseas.

• We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, product
liability, consumer, commercial, environmental, and tax litigations and claims;
government investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to
time in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe any of them will
have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Litigation is
inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we believe
we have valid defenses in these matters, we could in the future incur judgments
or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations in any particular period.

Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our
patents on various products or processes. Although we believe that we have
valid defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents,
there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any
of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at
issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could
materially affect future results of operations.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters and the headquarters of our Pharmaceutical and
Animal Health businesses are located at our world headquarters, which includes
several buildings in New York City. We own three of the buildings, including
our main, 33-story office tower at 235 East 42nd Street, and lease space in the
other buildings nearby. Our 33-story office tower is located on a site we lease
under a long-term ground lease.

For our Pharmaceutical businesses, we own and lease space around the world
for sales and marketing, administrative support and customer service functions.



Our Global Research and Development division is headquartered in New
London, Connecticut. We have major pharmaceutical research and development
operations in owned facilities in Amboise, France; Ann Arbor, Kalamazoo and
Portage, Michigan; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Groton, Connecticut; Nagoya,
Japan; St. Louis, Missouri; and Sandwich, England, U.K. We also lease major
facilities in La Jolla, California for pharmaceutical research and development
operations. As we announced shortly after the acquisition of Pharmacia in April
2003, we have closed or will close a number of other legacy Pfizer and legacy
Pharmacia pharmaceutical research and development operations in the U.S. and
various other countries.

We have veterinary medicine research and development operations in owned
facilities in Henrietta and Richland Township, Michigan; Lincoln, Nebraska; and
Sandwich, England, U.K.

The headquarters and the research and U.S. operations of our Consumer
Healthcare business are located in Morris Plains, New Jersey, where we own five
buildings and lease a smaller amount of space nearby. Consumer Healthcare’s
sales and marketing offices in the U.S. are located in leased facilities. In
most markets outside of the U.S., Consumer Healthcare’s sales and marketing
operations as well as administrative support are located in owned or leased
facilities shared with our Pharmaceutical and other businesses.

Our Global Manufacturing division operates plants in 86 locations around
the world that manufacture products for our Pharmaceutical, Consumer Healthcare
and Animal Health businesses. Major facilities are located in Belgium, Brazil,
China, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Singapore,
Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Global Manufacturing
division also operates numerous distribution facilities in major markets around
the world.

In general, our properties are well maintained, adequate and suitable to
their purposes. The growth of our businesses, including as a result of the
acquisition of Pharmacia in 2003, has created space pressures for certain
operations, however. We have responded to such challenges with plans to provide
appropriate facilities as needs are demonstrated. Among other steps, in 2003 we
purchased an additional building in New York City to accommodate the
requirements of our world headquarters. Note 7 to our consolidated financial
