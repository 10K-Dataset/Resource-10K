PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Pfizer Inc. (which may be referred to as

Pfizer, the Company, we

,

us

or

our

) is a
research-based, global pharmaceutical company. We discover, develop, manufacture and market leading
prescription medicines for humans and animals as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer
healthcare products.

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 2, 1942.

We acquired Warner-Lambert Company (Warner-Lambert) on June 19, 2000. The acquisition was
accounted for as a pooling of interests. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the U.S. (GAAP), we restated all consolidated financial statements of Pfizer for
periods prior to the acquisition to include the results of operations and financial position of
Warner-Lambert as if we had always been merged.

We acquired Pharmacia Corporation (Pharmacia) on April 16, 2003. The acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase. In accordance with GAAP, we did not restate our results of operations and
financial position to reflect the historical results of operations and financial position of
Pharmacia.

We completed the acquisition of Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. on February 10, 2004, for $1.3
billion in cash. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Esperion is a biopharmaceutical
company focused on the development of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-targeted (“good cholesterol”)
therapies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

Business Segments

We operate in three business segments: Human Health (previously named “Pharmaceutical”),
Consumer Healthcare and Animal Health.

We also operate several other businesses, including the manufacture of empty soft-gelatin
capsules, contract manufacturing and bulk pharmaceutical chemicals. Due to the size of these
businesses, they are grouped in and their results and assets are included in the “Corporate/Other”
category of our segment information.

Comparative segment revenues and related financial information for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are
presented in the table captioned

Segment

in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements,

Segment, Geographic and Revenue Information,

in our 2004 Financial Report and the section headed
Revenues in our 2004 Financial Report. The information from those sections of our 2004 Financial
Report is incorporated by reference in this 2004 Form 10-K.

Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries where we operate. In the U.S.,
the principal authority regulating our operations is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of the products we offer and our research quality,
manufacturing processes, product promotion, advertising and product labeling. Similar regulations
exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates our prices. See

Government Regulation and Price Constraints

below.

Human Health Segment

Our Human Health business is the largest pharmaceutical business in the world. This
segment includes treatments for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, central nervous system
disorders, arthritis and pain, infectious and respiratory diseases, urogenital conditions, cancer,
eye disease, endocrine disorders and allergies. In 2004, Human Health revenues increased 17%, to
$46.1 billion, due to strong performances across a broad range of products, the inclusion of a full
year of Pharmacia product sales and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Revenues from this
segment contributed 88% of our total revenues in each of 2004, 2003 and 2002. We recorded product
sales of more than $1 billion for each of ten pharmaceutical products in 2004. Those ten products -

Lipitor, Norvasc, Zoloft, Celebrex, Neurontin, Zithromax, Viagra, Zyrtec, Bextra

and

Xalatan -

represented 69% of Human Health revenues in 2004. A table captioned

Revenues

Major Human Health
Products

in our 2004 Financial Report is incorporated by reference.

Our principal pharmaceutical products and certain recently approved products are as follows:

Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases

•

Lipitor

, our largest-selling product, is for the
treatment of elevated cholesterol in the
bloodstream. It is the most-prescribed medicine of
any kind in the world and the industry’s first $10
billion product. It has also been approved for
prevention of cardio-vascular disease in patients
with multiple risk factors and in August 2004, was
approved by the FDA for the prevention of
cardiovascular disease in people with normal to
mildly elevated cholesterol levels.

•

Norvasc

is for the treatment of hypertension (high
blood pressure) and angina (heart pain). It is the
world’s most-prescribed branded medicine for the
treatment of hypertension and angina. In August
2004, we filed with the FDA for approval of

Norvasc

2003.

•

Accupril/Accuretic

is an angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for the treatment of
hypertension and congestive heart failure.

Accupril

began to face generic competition in the latter part
of 2004 due to the launch of generic quinapril by
certain generic drug manufacturers. Subsequently, we
launched our own generic version of Accupril in the
U.S. through our Greenstone Ltd. generic
pharmaceutical subsidiary.

December 2004. Pfizer will jointly market

Macugen

with Eyetech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., its discoverer.
Regulatory approval for

Macugen

has been applied for
in the E.U., Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
Switzerland, Brazil and Turkey.

Endocrine Disorders

•

Genotropin

is the world’s leading human recombinant
growth hormone. It is for the treatment of various
growth disorders in children and adults. Novo
Nordisk has granted us a non-exclusive license to
sell

Genotropin

in the U.S. In July 2004, an
application was filed in Japan for

Genotropin

for
the treatment of growth disorders.

Allergies

•

Zyrtec

is for the treatment of year-round indoor and
seasonal outdoor allergies and hives. It is
indicated for use in children as young as six months
old.

Zyrtec

is the leading branded antihistamine in
the U.S. in new prescriptions and the only
prescription antihistamine available in a syrup
formulation.

is the only
prescription oral antihistamine/decongestant
combination medicine approved to treat both
year-round indoor and outdoor allergies as well as
nasal congestion.

Zyrtec

is licensed to us by the
Belgian company UCB S.A. We copromote

Zyrtec

as a
prescription medicine in the U.S. with a subsidiary
of UCB S.A. and we have a license to sell

Zyrtec

under various trade names as an OTC
(over-the-counter) medicine in Canada, Europe,
Australia and South Africa.

Consumer Healthcare Segment

Our Consumer Healthcare business is one of the largest in the world. We market many of
the world’s best-known OTC medications for oral care, upper respiratory health, tobacco dependence,
gastrointestinal health, skin care, eye care and hair growth.

In 2004, Consumer Healthcare revenues increased 19%, to $3.5 billion, due to the strong
performance of

Listerine

mouthwash, which benefited from the U.S. launch of Natural Citrus flavor

Listerine

in September 2003 and the launch of

Listerine Advanced

in September 2004, the favorable
impact of foreign exchange and the inclusion of Pharmacia product revenues for a full year.
Revenues from this segment contributed 7% of our total revenues in both 2004 and 2003 and 8% in
2002.

Consumer Healthcare’s principal products include:

•

Listerine

mouthwash

•

Listerine PocketPaks

oral care strips

•

Nicorette

for tobacco dependence

•

Benadryl

antihistamine for allergies

•

Sudafed

for sinus congestion

•

Rogaine

for hair growth



•

Zantac 75

for prevention and relief of heartburn

•

Rolaids

antacid tablets

•

Efferdent

denture cleaner

•

Neosporin

antibiotic ointment

•

Visine

eye drops

•

BenGay

topical analgesic

•

Cortizone

skin care products

•

Lubriderm

moisturizing lotions

•

Unisom

sleep aids

•

Desitin

ointments for treatment of diaper rash

•

Ludens

throat drops

•

Purell

instant hand sanitizer

Consumer Healthcare can extend the life of some of our prescription medications by converting
them to OTC medications. For example,

Nicorette, Benadryl, Sudafed

and

Zantac 75

were all
previously prescription products and Zantac 150 was launched as an OTC medicine in January 2005. As
market conditions permit, and when we have necessary approval from drug regulatory authorities, we
plan to pursue similar launches for other products.

Animal Health Segment

Our Animal Health business is the largest in the world. We discover, develop and sell
products for the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock and companion animals. In 2004,
Animal Health revenues increased 22%, to $2.0 billion, due to strong performances by key in-line
brands, significant product launches including

Draxxin

and

Excede

for respiratory disease in cattle
and swine, strong growth in sales of

Rimadyl, Revolution

and

Clavamox

for companion animals, the
favorable impact of foreign exchange and the inclusion of Pharmacia product revenues for a full
year. Revenues from this segment contributed 3.7% of our total revenues in 2004, 3.6% of total
revenues in 2003 and 3.5% of total revenues in 2002.

Among the products we market are parasiticides, anti-inflammatories, vaccines, antibiotics and
related medicines, including the products discussed below.

Parasiticides constitute the largest segment of the animal health market for companion
animals, consisting mainly of medicines for the control of parasites such as fleas and heartworm.
Our product,

Revolution

, is our largest-selling parasiticide for companion animals.

Rimadyl

relieves pain and inflammation associated with canine osteoarthritis and soft tissue
orthopedic surgery.

Rimadyl

is the only arthritis pain medication prescribed by veterinarians
available in chewable tablets, regular caplets and in an injectable formulation.

Clavamox/Synulox

is an antibiotic for skin and soft tissue infections in dogs and cats.

Our vaccine portfolio for livestock is extensive and includes

RespiSureOne/
StellamuneOne,

a single-dose vaccine used to prevent pneumonia in swine, and

Bovi-Shield Gold,

a cattle vaccine for reproductive and respiratory protection.

Dectomax

injectable and pour-on formulations remove and control internal and external
parasites in beef cattle.

Naxcel/Excenel RTU

is an antibiotic used to treat respiratory and internal infections in
cattle and swine.

Research and Product Development

Innovation by our research and development operations is very important to the Company’s
success. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative products that address
major unmet medical needs. This goal has been supported by our substantial research and development
investments. We spent $7.7 billion in 2004, $7.5 billion in 2003 and $5.2 billion in 2002 on
research and development.

We conduct research internally and also through contracts with third parties, through
collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other
pharmaceutical firms. We also seek out innovative technologies developed by third parties to
incorporate into our discovery or development processes or projects, as well as our product lines,
through acquisition, licensing or other arrangements.

Drug discovery and development is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. On average,
only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by researchers



proves to be both
medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. The process from early
discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years. Drug candidates can
fail at any stage of the process. Candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many
years of research.

We believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the number of pharmaceutical
compounds we have in all stages of development. We currently are
working on approximately 225
projects in development, including approximately 145 new molecular
entities and 80 product-line
extensions. In addition, we have more than 400 projects in discovery research. In recent years, our
discovery scientists have delivered dozens of new chemical compounds to early development. While
these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval, new drug candidates
entering development are the foundation for future products.

In addition to discovering and developing new products, our research operations add value to
our existing products by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them. In
2004, for example, the FDA approved the additional use of

Geodon

for the treatment of acute mania
in bipolar disorder.

Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as well as supplemental
filings for existing products is set forth under the heading

Product Developments

in our 2004
Financial Report. That information is incorporated by reference.

Our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research and development. In
addition, the consolidation that has occurred in our industry has created companies with
substantial research and development resources. We also compete against numerous small
biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates. The extent to which our
competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our products
and unanticipated product obsolescence.

International Operations

We have significant operations outside the United States. They are managed through the
same business segments as our U.S. operations — Human Health, Consumer Healthcare and Animal
Health.

Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $23 billion accounted for 44% of our total
revenues in 2004. Revenues exceeded $500 million in each of ten countries outside the U.S. in 2004.
The U.S. was the only country to contribute more than 10% of our total revenues, comprising 56% of
revenues in 2004, 60% of our revenues in 2003 and 64% of our revenues in 2002. Japan is our
second-largest national market, with 6% of our revenues in each of 2004, 2003 and 2002.

For a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues, see the table captioned

Geographic

in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements,

Segment, Geographic and Revenue
Information,

in our 2004 Financial Report and the table captioned

Change in Geographic Revenues

in
our 2004 Financial Report. Those tables are incorporated by reference.

Our international businesses are subject, in varying degrees, to a number of risks inherent in
carrying on business in other countries. These include currency fluctuations, capital and exchange
control regulations, expropriation and other restrictive government actions. Our international
businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints, including laws on pricing or
reimbursement for use of products. See

Government Regulation and Price Constraints

below for
discussion of these matters.

Depending on the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can
increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. In
2004, revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange, as foreign currency movements relative
to the U.S. dollar increased our reported revenues in many countries. While we cannot predict
with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us, we
attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial
instruments. See the discussion under Note 8-D to our consolidated



financial statements,

Financial
Instruments: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

in our 2004 Financial Report.
That discussion is incorporated by reference. Related information about valuation and risks
associated with such financial instruments in parts E and F of that same Note is also incorporated
by reference.

Marketing

In our global Human Health business, we promote our products to health care providers
such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, hospitals, Pharmacy
Benefit Managers (PBMs), Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and government agencies. Through our
marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses and advantages of our products to healthcare
providers. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer print and
television advertising. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public about our
innovative medical research.

Our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations. Each sales organization
markets a distinct group of products. Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally
to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and
pharmacies.

We seek to gain access to health authority, PBM and MCO formularies (lists of recommended or
approved medicines and other products) and reimbursement lists by demonstrating the qualities and
treatment benefits of our products. We also work with MCOs and PBMs and other appropriate
healthcare providers to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that
help their medical treatment routines. For example, we sponsor a program offered by the State of
Florida Agency for Health Care Administration that is designed to help manage chronic diseases
among Florida’s Medicaid population.

Our Consumer Healthcare business primarily uses its own representatives to directly promote
its products, including marketing certain products directly to professionals using a professional
detail force. We also use print and television consumer advertising and offer sales incentives such
as coupons. Our consumer products are sold through various retailers.

Our Animal Health business also uses its own sales organization to promote its products. Its
advertising and promotion are generally targeted to health professionals, directly and through
veterinary journals. Animal health and nutrition products are sold through veterinarians, drug
wholesalers, distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users. Where appropriate, these
products are also marketed through print and television advertising.

During 2004, sales to our three largest customers were as follows:

•

McKesson, Inc. — 18.2% of our total revenues;

•

Cardinal Health, Inc. — 13.8% of our total revenues; and

•

AmerisourceBergen Corporation – 12.6% of our total revenues.

Sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the Human Health segment. Apart from these
instances, none of our business segments is dependent on any one customer or group of related
customers.

Patents and Intellectual Property Rights

Our products are sold around the world under brand-name, logo and certain product design
trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark protection
continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as
it is registered. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms.

We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents. These patents cover pharmaceutical and
other products and their uses; pharmaceutical formulations; product manufacturing processes; and
intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing.

Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent
filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is
obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country,
depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its



coverage and the availability of legal remedies
in the country.

In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses
in the U.S. and most other countries. Based on current product sales, and considering the vigorous
competition with products sold by others, the patent rights we consider significant in relation to
our business as a whole, together with the year in which the U.S. basic product patent expires
(including, where applicable, the additional six-month pediatric exclusivity period), are those for
the following drugs:

U.S. Basic Product Patent

Drug

Expiration Year

Zithromax


Zoloft


Norvasc


Zyrtec


Aricept


Lipitor


Xalatan

See below

Viagra


Detrol


Celebrex


Bextra


Genotropin


Neurontin

See below

In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to
particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods of
manufacturing or using the drug in
the treatment of further diseases or conditions. However, such patents may not protect the
Company’s drug from generic drug competition after the expiration of the basic product patent.

Zithromax

is patented by Pliva, a Croatian pharmaceutical company. The drug is licensed
exclusively to us by Pliva for sales and marketing in major countries, and we purchase the compound
in bulk crude form from Pliva. Although Zithromax has experienced patent expirations in certain
countries, it retains basic patent protection in the U.S. until November 2005.

Zyrtec

is patented by the Belgian company UCB S.A. and is licensed to us for sales in the
U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and South Africa. We copromote

Zyrtec

as a prescription medicine in
the U.S. with a subsidiary of UCB S.A. and have a license to sell

Zyrtec

under various trade names
as an OTC medicine in the other markets.

Aricept

is patented by Eisai Co., Ltd. We copromote

Aricept

with Eisai in the U.S. and several
other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the drug in certain other countries.

Xalatan

is not protected by a basic product patent. However, we have broadly patented
ophthalmic formulations containing lantanoprost until 2011.

Genotropin

is patented by Novo Nordisk, which has granted us a non-exclusive license to sell
the drug in the U.S.

The U.S. basic product patent relating to

Neurontin

expired in 1994. However, in April 2000, a
U.S. patent was granted relating to stable pharmaceutical compositions of

Neurontin

containing low
levels of lactam impurity. This patent expires in 2017. However,

Neurontin

now faces competition
from generic versions of the product launched “at-risk” (before the final resolution of legal
proceedings challenging the generic versions) by generic drug manufacturers during the latter half
of 2004. The patent infringement litigations related to this product continue. Following the
launches of these generic versions, in October, we launched our own generic version of the product
through our Greenstone Ltd. subsidiary.

Other companies have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of products that we also
believe infringe our patents covering, among other products,

Lipitor, Norvasc

,

Celebrex, Xalatan

and

Detrol.

We also have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser revenues.

The expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal
challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally
patented product and can result in a
significant reduction in sales of that product in a very short period. In some cases, however,
we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets; patents on
uses for products; patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the
active ingredients; patents for special



formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms; and
conversion of the active ingredient to OTC products.

One of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack
of effective intellectual property protection of our products. Under international agreements in
recent years, global protection of intellectual property rights is improving. The General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to
provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a ten-year transition period. A
number of countries are doing this. We have experienced significant growth in our businesses in
some of those nations, and our continued business expansion in those countries depends to a large
degree on further patent protection improvement.

Competition

Competition is intense in all of our businesses and includes many large and small
competitors. The principal means of competition vary among product categories and business groups.
However, the efficacy, safety, patients’ and customers’ ease of use and cost effectiveness of our
products are important factors for success in all of our principal businesses.

Our human pharmaceutical business is the largest in the world. We compete with other worldwide
research-based drug companies, many smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus
and generic drug manufacturers. Other companies manufacture and sell products that treat similar
diseases or indications as our major products.

We focus on unmet medical needs and therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation has
led to our multi-billion-dollar research and development investments over the past decade.

In recent years, a comparison of the total cost of medical treatments using pharmaceuticals
versus alternative treatments for the same condition has become an important basis of competition.
MCOs and PBMs look to cost advantages as well as medical benefits in making their drug formulary
decisions.

Our pharmaceutical sales and marketing organization is a valuable competitive asset. Our
salespeople’s ability to reach medical professionals with information about our products helps us
respond to competitive efforts and launch new products.

Our consumer healthcare business is one of the largest in the world. However, many other
companies, large and small, manufacture and sell one or more products that are similar to our
consumer healthcare products, including major retail customers that sell “private label” or “house”
brands. Sources of competitive advantage include product quality and
efficacy, including differentiated
claims, brand identity, advertising and promotion, product innovation, broad distribution
capabilities and price. Significant expenditures for advertising, promotion and marketing are
generally required to achieve and maintain both consumer and trade acceptance of consumer products.

While our animal health business is the largest in the world, many other companies offer
competitive products. Altogether, there are hundreds of producers of animal health products
throughout the world. The principal methods of competition vary somewhat depending on the
particular product. They include product innovation, quality, service, effective promotion to
veterinary professionals and consumers and price.

Managed Care Organizations

The growth of MCOs in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitive make-up of the
health care marketplace. A substantial portion of the U.S. population now participates in some
version of managed care. Because of the size of the patient population covered by MCOs, marketing
of prescription drugs to them and the PBM’s that serve many of those organizations has become
important to our business.

MCOs can include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators, health-
maintenance organizations, alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician
organizations. The purchasing power of MCOs has been increasing in recent years due to their
growing numbers of enrolled patients. At the same time, those organizations have been consolidating
into fewer, even larger entities. This enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us.



The growth of MCOs has increased pressure on drug prices. A major objective of MCOs is to
contain and, where possible, reduce health care expenditures. They typically use formularies,
volume purchases and long-term contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers. They
use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices. They also emphasize primary and
preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics.
Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully
managed. Since the use of certain drugs can prevent the need for hospitalization, professional
therapy or even surgery, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases.

As discussed above in

Marketing

, MCOs and PBMs typically develop formularies to reduce their
cost for medications. Formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the
available products. Due to their generally lower cost, generic medicines are often favored. The
breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another and
many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical
problems. MCOs use a variety of means to encourage patients’ use of products listed on their
formularies.

Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the MCO
patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their
products included. Where possible, companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of
their products, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower
overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic
advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price. We have been generally, although
not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies.

The impact of MCOs on drug prices and volumes may increase as the result of their role in
negotiating on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries in connection with the limited out-patient drug
benefit under Medicare, as discussed below under

Government Regulation and Price Constraints

.

Another way we address the interests of MCOs is by developing disease-management programs.
These programs can be attractive to MCOs by improving patient communications and compliance with
dosage directions, which are important for effective disease treatment. They can help MCOs address
various aspects of disease management, such as prevention, diagnosis and treatment of certain
diseases, including use of pharmaceutical products. This comprehensive approach can improve the
quality of care and lower costly complications of chronic diseases. As noted above in

Marketing

,
one such program, which is sponsored by us and offered by the State of Florida Agency for Health
Care Administration, is designed to help manage chronic diseases among Florida’s Medicaid
population.

Generic Products

One of the biggest competitive challenges that we face in the U.S. and that is growing
internationally is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patent
protection for a product, we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short
period. Generic competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our
costs of conveying medical information about the product to the medical community. In addition, the
FDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate
their safety and efficacy, and allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of
the pioneer product. Generic products need only demonstrate a level of availability in the
bloodstream equivalent to that of the pioneer product. This means that, after we have borne the
expenses of discovering, developing and testing a medicine for safety and efficacy, obtaining
regulatory approval and informing the medical community about its therapeutic benefits, generic
competitors can market a competing version of our
product after the expiration or loss of our patent and charge much less.

As noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics
over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to
brand-name drugs in their health care programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S.
generally allow, and in some cases require,



pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been
rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to brand-name drugs. The
substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. As and when
appropriate, we will employ our Greenstone Ltd. subsidiary to launch our own generic versions of
products after we lose market exclusivity.

Raw Materials

Raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course
of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials are available from multiple
sources. No serious shortages or delays were encountered in 2004, and none are expected in 2005.

Government Regulation and Price Constraints

In the United States

General.

Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by
national, state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business. Of particular
importance is the FDA in the U.S. It has jurisdiction over our human pharmaceutical business and
administers requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling,
marketing, advertising and post-marketing surveillance of our pharmaceutical products. The FDA also
regulates most of our consumer healthcare products and, along with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, our animal health products.

In addition, many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal
regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human
Services, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. Individual states, acting
through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of
prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws.

We are subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these various
regulatory bodies (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements,

Legal Proceedings and
Contingencies,

in our 2004 Financial Report). Such actions may include product recalls, seizures
and other civil and criminal sanctions.

Medicare.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the 2003 Medicare Act) was enacted. Under this legislation, Medicare
beneficiaries are eligible to obtain a Medicare-endorsed, drug-discount card from an MCO, PBM or
other private sector provider through the end of 2005. Beginning in 2006, Medicare beneficiaries
will be eligible to obtain subsidized prescription drug coverage from a private sector provider. It
remains difficult to predict the impact of the 2003 Medicare Act on pharmaceutical companies. Usage
of pharmaceuticals may increase as the result of the expanded access to medicines afforded by the
partial reimbursement under Medicare. Such potential sales increases, however, may be offset by
increased pricing pressures due to the enhanced purchasing power of the private sector providers
that will negotiate on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.

Pfizer is committed to helping those without coverage access Pfizer products. To that end, in
2004, we implemented our Helpful Answers program, an umbrella program that includes existing Pfizer
patient assistance programs, as well as Pfizer Pfriends, a new prescription discount card offering
savings on Pfizer prescription medicines to all uninsured Americans, regardless of age or income.
In addition, through many Medicare-approved drug discount cards, including the U-Share card on
which Pfizer partners with United Healthcare, qualified low-income Medicare beneficiaries have
access to up to a thirty day supply of many Pfizer medicines for a flat fee of
$15 per prescription after they have exhausted the government’s $600 annual credit. To date,
approximately 18 cards offer such a discount. In January 2005, we also joined Together Rx Access
with nine other pharmaceutical companies to offer savings on over 275 medicines to
Medicare-ineligible, uninsured individuals under 65 who fall below certain income thresholds.

Importation of Drugs

. There is considerable political pressure to allow the
importation into the U.S. of prescription drugs that are marketed outside the U.S. and sold at
prices that are



regulated by the governments of various foreign countries. In addition to raising
safety concerns, such importation could impact pharmaceutical prices in the U.S. While the 2003
Medicare Act maintains the current prohibition on such imports, it would allow importation from
Canada if the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that such importation is safe and
would result in savings to consumers. Before the 2003 Medicare Act, federal law would have
permitted importation of medicines into the U.S. from a considerably larger group of developed
countries, provided the Secretary of Health and Human Services made the same safety and
cost-savings certifications. On December 21, 2004, the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) and the Department of Commerce issued their reports on drug importation and foreign price
controls. The HHS report noted that it would be “extraordinarily difficult to ensure that drugs
personally imported by individual consumers” could meet the standards of safety that would support
certifying as safe such importation. While the report also concluded that the U.S. could establish
a feasible basis for commercial drug importation, such a change in the law would require “new legal
authorities, substantial additional resources and significant restrictions on the types of drugs
that could be imported.” The report also noted that the total savings to be expected from such a
commercial importation regime would be relatively small—1% or 2% of total drug spending in the U.S.
The Commerce Department report confirmed that the lower prices in many countries result from
governmental price controls, and these price controls adversely affect the amount of funding that
is available for the discovery of new drugs.

Medicaid and Related Matters

. In recent years, various proposals have been offered at
the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in the Medicaid program. Driven
by budget concerns, some states have implemented and other states are considering importation
programs, price controls or patient-access constraints on medicines under the Medicaid program. If
changes are implemented under the Medicaid program that restrict the access of a significant
population of patients to our innovative medicines, our business could be materially affected. In
addition, some states are considering price-control regimes that
would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not
Medicaid eligible, as well as various approaches to controlling pharmaceutical
marketing.

U.S. law requires us to give rebates to state Medicaid agencies based on each state’s
reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the Medicaid program. Some states and multi-state
pools are seeking rebates in excess of the amounts required by federal law, and there are federal
legislative proposals to expand current Medicaid rebates. We also must give discounts or rebates on
purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies
and programs. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Revenues
section of our 2004 Financial
Report, and in Note 1-G to our consolidated financial statements,

Significant Accounting Policies,
Revenues,

in our 2004 Financial Report, which discussions are incorporated by reference.

Outside the United States

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. In Europe
and some other international markets, the government provides health care at low direct cost to
consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for
the government-sponsored health care system. This international patchwork of price regulation has
led to different prices and some third-party trade in our products from markets with lower prices.
Such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with
higher prices.

Since 1998, the approval of new drugs across the E.U. is possible only using the mutual
recognition procedure or EMEA’s central approval
process. The use of either of these procedures provides a more rapid and consistent approval
within the member states than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently
within each member state. Further, Norway and Iceland are full participants in these approval
processes. The addition of ten new member states to the E.U. in May 2004 has extended the scope of
these approval procedures. Since the E.U. does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or
pricing matters in its member states, we will continue to deal with



individual countries on such
issues across the enlarged E.U.

During 2004, a comprehensive package of reforms was adopted, amending E.U. law on the
regulation of medicinal products in many areas, including approval procedures and safety reporting.
Of particular note, the data exclusivity periods during which innovative companies’ regulatory data
are protected will be harmonized in all member states, and the approval and launch of generic
medicines will be facilitated in several respects. The new law, due to take effect by November
2005, will also shorten certain approval timelines and introduce fast-track and conditional
centralized authorizations.

Environmental Law Compliance

Most of our operations are affected by federal, state and/or local environmental laws. We
have made, and intend to continue to make, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable
laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain
sites (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements,

Legal Proceedings and Contingencies,

in our 2004 Financial Report). As a result, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in
2004 for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity and for other environmental compliance
purposes as follows:

•

environment-related capital expenditures — $68 million

•

other environment-related expenses — $274 million

While we cannot predict with certainty future capital expenditures or operating costs for
environmental compliance, we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Tax Matters

The discussion of tax-related matters in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements,

Taxes on Income

, in our 2004 Financial Report, is incorporated by reference.

Employees

In our innovation-intensive business, our employees are vital to our success. We believe
we have good relationships with our employees. As of December 31, 2004, we employed approximately
115,000 people in our operations throughout the world.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results

(Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)

Our disclosure and analysis in this 2004

Form 10-K

and in our 2004 Annual Report to
Shareholders contain some forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on
management’s plans and assumptions. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements
in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such
statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by
using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,”
“will” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial
performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective
products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products,
sales efforts, expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of
contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe
we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to
risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could
differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear
this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information, future events or otherwise. You



are advised, however, to consult any further
disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q and 8-K reports to the SEC. Also note that we
provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate
assumptions relevant to our businesses. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate,
we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.
We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential
risks or uncertainties.

• U.S. and foreign governmental regulations mandating price controls and patient-access
constraints impact our business, and our future results could be affected by changes in such
regulations. In the U.S., many pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing pressures.
Such pressures may increase as the result of the 2003 Medicare Act. On the other hand, usage of
pharmaceuticals also may increase due to the expanded access to medicines afforded by the partial
reimbursement under the 2003 Medicare Act. In addition, MCOs as well as Medicaid and other
government agencies continue to seek price discounts. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid
expenses may continue to increase the use of MCOs. This may result in managed care’s influencing
prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population. In addition, some states have
implemented and other states are considering price controls or patient-access constraints under the
Medicaid program and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to
broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid eligible. Other matters that could be the subject of U.S. federal or state legislative or
regulatory action affecting our business include the importation of prescription drugs that are
marketed outside the U.S. and sold at prices that are regulated by the governments of various
foreign countries and the involuntary approval of prescription medicines for OTC use.

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. In Europe and
some other international markets, the government provides health care at low direct cost to
consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for
the government-sponsored health care system. This international patchwork of price regulation has
led to different prices and some third-party trade in our products from markets with lower prices.
Such trade exploiting price differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with
higher prices.

As a result, it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of operating results will
continue.

• Competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge in the U.S. and is
growing internationally. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, or upon
the “at-risk” launch (while patent infringement litigation against the generic product is pending) by
a generic manufacturer of a generic version of a product, we can lose the major portion of sales of
that product in a very short period. The patents covering several of our most important medicines,
including

Lipitor

,

Norvasc

,

Neurontin, Celebrex

,

Xalatan

and

Detrol

, are being challenged by
generic manufacturers.

• We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive
products or their possible effect on our sales. Products that compete with our drugs, including
some of our best-selling medicines, are launched from time to time. Launches of a number of
competitive products have occurred recently, and certain potentially competitive products are in
various stages of development, some of which have been
filed for approval with the FDA and with regulatory authorities in other countries.

• We recorded product sales of more than $1 billion for each of ten pharmaceutical
products in 2004:

Lipitor, Norvasc, Zoloft, Celebrex, Neurontin, Zithromax, Viagra, Zyrtec, Bextra

and

Xalatan.

Those products accounted for 61% of our total 2004 revenues. If these or any of our other
major products were to become subject to a problem such as loss of patent protection, material
product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, publicity affecting
doctor or patient confidence or pressure from existing competitive products, or if a new, more
effective treatment should be introduced, the impact on our revenues could be significant. As
noted, patents



covering several of our best-selling medicines are the subject of pending legal
challenges.

• Final actions relating to

Celebrex

and/or

Bextra

that may be taken by the FDA and/or
the EMEA in connection with their respective reviews of the benefits and risks of COX-2-specific
inhibitor medicines and related agents could result in a significant loss of sales of one or both
of those drugs, which would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

• The discovery and development of new products as well as the development of additional
uses for existing products is very important to the success of the Company. However, balancing
current growth and investment for the future remains a major challenge. Our ongoing investments in
new product introductions and in research and development for new products and existing product
extensions could exceed corresponding sales growth. This could produce higher costs without a
proportional increase in revenues.

• Risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to product-related,
forward-looking statements. The outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new
compounds and developing new products is inherently uncertain. There can be no assurance as to
whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products or for new indications or
dosage forms for existing products. Decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and
other matters could affect the commercial potential of our products. There also are many
considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical products around the world. Regulatory
delays, the inability to successfully complete clinical trials, claims and concerns about safety
and efficacy, new discoveries, patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of
the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and development and
product-related, forward-looking statements.

• Decisions about research studies made early in the development process of a drug
candidate can have a substantial impact on the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval.
More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they
consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for initial approval. We try
to plan clinical trials prudently, but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and
testing will be made in each case. The quality of our decisions in this area could affect our
future results.

• 44% of our 2004 revenues were derived from international operations, including 6% from
Japan. These international-based revenues as well as our substantial international assets expose
our revenues and earnings to foreign currency exchange rate changes. In addition, our
interest-bearing investments, loans and borrowings are subject to risk from changes in interest
rates. These risks and the measures we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the section
entitled Financial Risk Management in our 2004 Financial Report. For additional details, see Note
8-D to our consolidated financial statements,

Financial Instruments: Derivative Financial
Instruments and Hedging Activities

, in our 2004 Financial Report. Those sections of our 2004
Financial Report are incorporated by reference.

Notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes in fiscal
circumstances, we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency and interest rates, inflation
or other related factors affecting our businesses.

• Our international operations also could be affected by changes in intellectual property
legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval,
production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing
of products, as well as by unstable governments and legal systems and inter-governmental disputes.

• Difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing, including, but not
limited to, the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand, or the failure
to predict market demand for, or to gain market acceptance of, approved products, could affect
future results.

• Growth in costs and expenses, changes in product mix and the impact of acquisitions,
divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from
evolving business strategies, evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring
could affect future results. Such risks and uncertainties



include, in particular, our ability to
integrate and to obtain the anticipated results and synergies from our acquisition of Pharmacia.

• Our future results could be affected by changes in laws and regulations, including
changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax-rate changes, new tax laws
and revised tax law interpretations), competition laws and environmental laws in the U.S. and other
countries.

• Our future results could be affected by changes in business, political and economic
conditions, including the cost and availability of insurance, due to the threat of future terrorist
activity in the U.S. and other parts of the world and related U.S. military action overseas.

• We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, product liability,
consumer, commercial, securities, environmental and tax litigations and claims; government
investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of
our business. We do not believe any of them will have a material adverse effect on our financial
position. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we
believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future incur judgments or
enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations in any particular period.

Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our patents on various
products or processes. Although we believe we have substantial defenses to these challenges with
respect to all our material patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters,
and a loss in any of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at issue,
which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could materially affect future
results of operations.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters and the headquarters of our Human Health and Animal Health
businesses are located at our world headquarters, which includes several buildings in New York
City. We own three of the buildings, including our main, 33-story office tower at 235 East
