ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
GENERAL
 
    Pfizer  Inc. (the "Company") is a research-based global health care company.
The   Company   discovers,   develops,   manufactures   and   sells   innovative
technology-intensive  products in  three business  segments: Health  Care, which
includes a  broad range  of prescription  pharmaceuticals, orthopedic  implants,
medical  devices and  surgical equipment;  Animal Health,  which includes animal
health products and feed supplements; and Consumer Health Care, which includes a
variety of nonprescription drugs and  personal care products. Additionally,  the
Company's  Financial Subsidiaries  include a banking  operation in  Europe and a
small captive insurance operation.
 
COMPARATIVE SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
 
    Comparative segment information and geographic data as of and for the  years
ended  December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993 are set forth on pages 40 and 41, and in
the Note "Financial Subsidiaries" on page 47 and a description of the  Company's
business  segments is  set forth on  page 58  of the Company's  Annual Report to
Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 1995 and are incorporated herein by
reference.
 
HEALTH CARE
 
    The Company's  Health  Care business  is  comprised of  pharmaceuticals  and
hospital  products.  The  Company  competes  with  numerous  other  health  care
companies in  the discovery  and development  of new,  technologically  advanced
pharmaceutical  and hospital  products; in  seeking use  of its  products by the
medical profession; and in the sale of its product lines to wholesale and retail
outlets, public and  private hospitals, managed  care organizations,  government
and the medical profession.
 
    The  principal  methods  of  competition  in  health  care  vary  by product
category. There are a significant number of innovative companies in the field. A
critical factor in most markets in which the Company competes is the ability  to
offer  technological  advances over  competitive  products. The  productivity of
scientific discovery and  clinical development efforts  is central to  long-term
operational  success since there are many companies that specialize in marketing
products that no longer  have patent or  regulatory protection. Other  important
factors   in  these  markets  include  the  ability  to  transfer  knowledge  of
technological  advances  to  the  medical  community,  product  quality,  prompt
delivery and price.
 
    The United States pharmaceutical marketplace has in recent years experienced
intensified  price  competition,  brought about  by  a range  of  market forces,
including: new  product development,  increased generic  competition, growth  of
managed care organizations and legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to
provide  rebates  and  discounts  to  government  agencies.  Similar competitive
forces, in varying degrees, have also been present in various other countries in
which the Company operates.
 
    Prescription pharmaceutical and hospital products, both in the United States
and abroad, are  promoted directly to  physicians, as  well as to  a variety  of
managed   care  organizations.   The  Company   conducts  corporate  advertising
nationally, using both print and television media, to inform the general  public
about the Company and its innovative medical research. Certain specific products
have   also   been  advertised   directly  to   consumers  beginning   in  1995.
Pharmaceutical products are  distributed in  large part  to wholesalers,  retail
outlets, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and managed care organizations.
Hospital  products are generally  sold directly to  medical institutions and, in
some cases, through distributors and surgical supply dealers.
 

    PHARMACEUTICALS
 
    The Company's worldwide pharmaceutical  products are comprised primarily  of
drugs  which fall into the following major therapeutic classes: cardiovasculars,
anti-infectives,  central   nervous  system   agents,  anti-inflammatories   and
antidiabetes  agents. In 1995, pharmaceuticals  contributed 71% of the Company's
consolidated net sales, as compared to 73% in 1994 and 72% in 1993. Increases in
both United  States  and  international pharmaceutical  revenues  in  1995  were
principally  the  result of  strong  sales of  products  launched in  the 1990s,
including Norvasc (amlodipine besylate), Cardura (doxazosin mesylate),  Diflucan
(fluconazole),  Zithromax (azithromycin),  Zoloft (sertraline)  and Glucotrol XL
(glipizide GITS).
 
    Cardiovascular products are the  Company's largest therapeutic product  line
accounting  for 30% of the Company's 1995  consolidated net sales as compared to
30% and 28% in 1994 and 1993, respectively. Sales of these products grew 23%  in
1995,  including a 65% increase in sales of Norvasc, a long-lasting (once-a-day)
calcium channel blocker for hypertension and  angina, as well as a 32%  increase
in  sales of Cardura, an  alpha blocker for hypertension.  Sales of Procardia XL
(nifedipine GITS),  a  long-lasting  (once-a-day) calcium  channel  blocker  for
hypertension  and  angina, decreased  by  4% in  1995.  A supplemental  New Drug
Application for  the  use  of  Cardura in  the  treatment  of  benign  prostatic
hyperplasia  ("BPH"), an enlargement of the  prostate gland, was approved by the
United States Food and  Drug Administration ("FDA") in  February 1995. Usage  of
Cardura for this indication contributed to its increase in sales for the year.
 
    Worldwide  anti-infective sales increased 23% in 1995 mainly on the strength
of  Diflucan  and   Zithromax.  U.S.   anti-infective  sales   grew  24%   while
international  sales rose by  22%. Diflucan, an  anti-fungal agent, is indicated
for use in a variety of fungal infections including certain types which  afflict
AIDS  and  immunosuppressed  cancer  patients. The  product  also  received U.S.
approval for the indication  of vaginal candidiasis in  1994. Diflucan posted  a
sales  increase of 22% in 1995 and Zithromax, an oral antibiotic, posted a sales
increase of 97%. Part of the growth  of Zithromax in the U.S. can be  attributed
to  the October 1995 approval  from the FDA for  pediatric use of Zithromax oral
suspension for  acute otitis  media and  streptococcal  pharnygitis/tonsillitis.
Total  anti-infective sales accounted for 21% of the Company's consolidated 1995
net sales, compared to 22% in 1994 and 23% in 1993.
 
    U.S. sales  of Pfizer's  central nervous  system agents  rose 41%  in  1995,
reflecting  increased sales of Zoloft, an anti-depressant introduced in the U.S.
in 1992. In August 1995, the Company received an approvable letter from the  FDA
for  an  indication of  obsessive compulsive  disorder ("OCD").  Central nervous
system agents grew to 11% of the Company's consolidated 1995 net sales from  10%
in 1994 and 7% in 1993.
 
    In  September 1995, the  Company received an approvable  letter from the FDA
for pediatric use  of the  antihistamine, Zyrtec (cetirizine  HCl). In  December
1995,  the  FDA  granted marketing  clearance  to  Zyrtec for  the  treatment of
seasonal and perennial  allergic rhinitis,  and chronic  urticaria. Zyrtec,  the
most  widely prescribed antihistamine in Europe, is currently marketed worldwide
by the Belgian company, UCB  S.A., and is licensed to  the Company for the  U.S.
and  Canada. Pfizer  and UCB  Pharma, a subsidiary  of UCB  S.A., will copromote
Zyrtec in the U.S. This  product was launched in Canada  in 1991 under the  name
Reactine. It was launched in the United States in February 1996.
 
    In  February 1996, the Company  acquired Bioindustria Farmaceutici S.p.A. an
Italian company engaged in the  production and distribution of prescription  and
over-the-counter pharmaceutical products.
 

    The  Company  currently is  seeking approval  by the  FDA for  the following
products for the indications listed:
 

 
    In addition, the Company has marketing rights in the United States and Japan
to XOMA Corporation, Inc.'s E5, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of  gram
negative sepsis, which is undergoing FDA regulatory review.
 
    HOSPITAL PRODUCTS
 
    The Company's Hospital Products Group consists of two divisions -- Howmedica
and  the Medical Devices Division. Howmedica manufactures and markets orthopedic
implants. Medical Devices consists of  four core businesses -- Schneider,  NAMIC
U.S.A.  Corporation ("NAMIC"), Valleylab and American Medical Systems as well as
smaller businesses,  including  Strato/Infusaid.  In  1995,  the  sales  of  the
Hospital  Products Group  accounted for  13% of  the Company's  consolidated net
sales compared with 14% in 1994 and 15% in 1993.
 
    Howmedica's reconstructive hip, knee  and bone cement  products are used  to
replace  joints  which  have deteriorated  as  a  result of  disease  or injury.
Howmedica's internal  and  external  fixation devices  are  used  by  orthopedic
surgeons  to  manage  bone  fractures.  In  January  1996,  Pfizer  acquired the
Leibinger Companies headquartered  in Freiburg, Germany  and Dallas, Texas.  The
Leibinger  Companies, which will operate as a division of Howmedica, are leaders
in the development, manufacture and distribution of implantable devices used  in
oral  and craniomaxillofacial  surgery and specialty  surgical instruments. They
have also pioneered advances in  stereotaxy equipment and computer software  for
sophisticated neurological procedures.
 
    Schneider,  an international leader  in angioplasty catheters,  is a leading
supplier of stents for vascular  and non-vascular applications. NAMIC,  acquired
in   March  1995,   designs,  manufactures   and  markets   a  broad   range  of
single-patient-use medical  products, primarily  for use  in the  diagnosis  and
treatment  of  atherosclerotic  cardiovascular  disease.  NAMIC's  product lines
complement those of Schneider and are expected to expand opportunities for  both
businesses.
 
    Valleylab  is  a  leading  manufacturer  of  electrosurgical  and ultrasonic
surgical equipment  used in  open and  minimally invasive  surgical  procedures.
Valleylab  continues to invest in new product lines to improve surgical outcomes
and enhance both patient and physician safety.
 
    American Medical Systems  is a  manufacturer and marketer  of impotence  and
incontinence  implants. In  September 1995, AMS  entered into  an agreement with
Reprogenesis L.P. to collaborate on novel applications of tissue engineering for
the treatment of urological disorders.
 

    Strato/Infusaid is a  manufacturer and supplier  of vascular access  devices
and  advanced drug delivery  systems. In October  1995, Strato/Infusaid received
FDA approval for sale of implantable pumps for the intrathecal administration of
morphine.
 
ANIMAL HEALTH
 
    In January 1995, the Company  acquired the SmithKline Beecham Animal  Health
("SBAH") business, a world leader in animal vaccines and companion animal health
products,  which complemented the  Company's existing animal  health business in
terms of product, species and  geographic sales coverage. The acquired  business
has been fully integrated into the Company's animal health business.
 
    The  Company's  Animal Health  Group  discovers, develops,  manufactures and
sells animal health  products for the  prevention and treatment  of diseases  in
livestock,  poultry,  companion  animals and  other  animals. The  Company  is a
significant  manufacturer   of   injectable   antibiotics,   anthelmintics   and
anticoccidial  products for food animals, and  with the acquisition of SBAH, the
Company became a significant  manufacturer of biologicals  and pet products.  In
1995,  the Animal Health Group contributed 12% of the Company's consolidated net
sales, compared with 8% in 1994 and in 1993.
 
    The  principal  products   of  the   Animal  Health   Group  are:   Dectomax
(doramectin),  the Company's antiparasitic which was  first launched in 1993 and
is now  available in  much of  Latin America,  South Africa  and Europe;  Stafac
(virginiamycin),  a feed additive anti-infective  for poultry, cattle and swine;
Terramycin  LA-200  (oxytetracycline)  (marketed  as  TM/LA  outside  of   North
America),   a  broad-spectrum  injectable  antibiotic;  the  Banminth  (pyrantel
tartrate),  Nemex   (pyrantel   pamoate)  and   Paratect   (morantel   tartrate)
anthelmintics;  Coxistac and Posistac (salinomycin) anticoccidials primarily for
poultry;   Valbazen   (albendazole),    a   bovine   parasiticide;    Terramycin
(oxytetracycline),  a  broad-spectrum antibiotic  used for  a variety  of animal
diseases;  Mecadox   (carbadox),  an   antibacterial  for   pigs;  and   Advocin
(danofloxacin),   the  Company's  new  antibacterial  for  treating  respiratory
diseases  in  livestock   and  poultry.     Aviax   (semduramicin),  a   potent,
broad-spectrum  ionophore anticoccidial used to  prevent coccidiosis in poultry,
was launched in 1995 in Japan  and Latin America. The Company also  manufactures
and  sells  an extensive  line of  cattle, swine  and companion  animal vaccines
including BoviShield, Leukocell, RespiSure and Vanguard.
 
    Animal health and  nutrition products are  sold through veterinarians,  drug
wholesalers,  distributors, retail outlets and directly to users, including feed
manufacturers and animal  producers. The principal  methods of competition  with
respect  to animal health products vary somewhat but include product innovation,
service, price, quality and effective transfer of technological advances to  the
market  through  advertising  and  promotion.  A  substantial  number  of  other
companies manufacture and  sell one  or more products  that are  similar to  the
Company's  animal health  products. There  are hundreds  of producers  of animal
health products throughout the world.
 
CONSUMER HEALTH CARE
 
    The Company's  Consumer Health  Care  Group's products  include  proprietary
health  items, baby care products and toiletries,  and a number of products sold
only in selected international markets,  including Vanart hair care products  in
Mexico  and Migraleve over-the-counter  ("OTC") migraine medication  and the TCP
line of  antiseptic and  germicidal products  marketed primarily  in the  United
Kingdom.
 
    Among  the  better-known OTC  brands manufactured  and marketed  by Consumer
Health  Care  are  Visine  (tetrahydrozoline  HCl)  eyedrops,  Ben-Gay   topical
analgesics,  Desitin diaper rash ointments,  Unisom (doxylamine succinate) sleep
aids, Plax pre-brushing dental rinse, Rid anti-lice products and Barbasol  shave
creams  and gels.  Line extensions  introduced in  recent years  include: Unisom
SleepGels, soft liquid-filled  gels with a  maximum-strength sleep aid  formula;
Daily  Care from Desitin, a  lotion for the prevention  of diaper rash; Barbasol
Pure Silk women's shave products; and new
 

formulations of Rid  and Plax.  In August 1995,  the Company  purchased Bain  de
Soleil  skin care  products from  Procter & Gamble.  In March  1996, the Company
agreed to acquire the  Cortizone and Hemorid brands  from Thompson Medical  Co.,
Inc.  Cortizone is a  leading brand of  over-the-counter hydrocortisone products
and Hemorid is the  only brand of  hemorrhoidal preparations expressly  designed
for women.
 
    The  Company completed several successful prescription--to--over-the-counter
(OTC) launches  in  1995.  An  OTC version  of  Reactine,  Canada's  leading  Rx
antihistamine  (cetirizine  HCl), was  launched in  that  country in  April. OTC
formulations of tioconazole were  introduced in Canada  as GyneCure for  vaginal
candidiasis  and  Trosyd  AF  for  athlete's  foot.  In  November,  Diflucan One
(fluconazole) was launched in the United Kingdom as a one-pill OTC treatment for
vaginal candidiasis. In February 1996,  Juscoat (piroxicam gel) was launched  in
Japan for treatment of chronic shoulder and back pain.
 
    Many  other companies,  large and  small, manufacture  and sell  one or more
products that are similar to the Company's consumer health products. The Company
is a significant  competitor in  this extensive  OTC market,  and its  principal
methods  of competition  include product  quality, product  innovation, customer
satisfaction,  broad  distribution  capabilities,  significant  advertising  and
promotion  efforts and price. In general,  the winning and retaining of consumer
acceptance of the  Company's consumer  products involve  heavy expenditures  for
advertising, promotion and marketing.
 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS: FOOD SCIENCE BUSINESS
 
    In  December  1995, the  Company agreed  to sell  substantially all  the net
assets  of  its  food  science  business   to  Cultor  Ltd.,  a  publicly   held
international nutrition company based in Finland, for approximately $350 million
in  cash. The  sale was  completed in  January 1996.  Disposal of  the remaining
assets, which are  not material to  the Company's business  or the food  science
business,  is  expected to  be completed  over several  years. The  food science
business  has  been  reported  in  the  Company's  financial  statements  as   a
discontinued operation.
 
FINANCIAL SUBSIDIARIES
 
    The  Company conducts international banking operations through a subsidiary,
Pfizer International  Bank  Europe  (PIBE),  based  in  Dublin,  Ireland.  PIBE,
incorporated  under the laws  of Ireland, operates under  a full banking license
from the Central  Bank of  Ireland. It  makes loans  and accepts  deposits in  a
number  of currencies  in international  markets. PIBE  is an  active Euromarket
lender through  its portfolio  of loans  and money  market instruments  to  high
quality  corporations and sovereigns. Loans are made  on a short and medium term
basis, with floating interest rates.
 
    The Company's  insurance operation,  The Kodiak  Company Limited,  reinsures
certain  assets,  inland transport  and marine  cargo of  Pfizer's international
operations.
 
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
 
    Outside the  United States,  the Company  has significant  operations,  both
direct  and through  distributors that, in  general, parallel  its United States
businesses. In 1995, the Company registered  net sales in excess of $10  million
in  each of 45 countries outside the U.S., with no single country other than the
U.S. and Japan,  contributing more than  10% of total  net sales. The  Company's
international  businesses are subject, in varying  degrees, to a number of risks
inherent in carrying on business in certain countries outside the United States,
including  possible   nationalization,  expropriation   and  other   restrictive
government  actions  such as  capital regulations.  In  addition, the  values of
currencies change and can either  favorably or unfavorably impact the  financial
position  and the  results of operations  of the  Company.  It  is impossible to
predict future changes in foreign exchange  values or the effect they will  have
on the Company. The Company actively manages its foreign exchange risk through a
variety  of  techniques  including the  use  of foreign  currency  contracts. In
addition, the
 

Company engages in hedging programs  designed to protect selected balance  sheet
positions  and future cash  flow exposures. Further  information with respect to
the  financial  instruments  used  to  carry  out  these  hedging  programs   is
incorporated  by  reference  to  the note  entitled  "Financial  Instruments and
Concentrations of Credit  Risk" beginning  on page 47  of the  Annual Report  to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995.
 
TAX MATTERS
 
    The  earnings of the Company's pharmaceutical subsidiary operating in Puerto
Rico are  subject to  taxes pursuant  to an  incentive grant  effective  through
December  31,  2002. Under  this  grant, the  Company  is partially  exempt from
income, property and municipal taxes. For tax years beginning after December 31,
1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA") reduced by 40%  the
benefits  accruing to the Company under Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code
(the "Puerto Rico  tax credit"). Such  tax benefits will  decline an  additional
five  percentage points  per year  through 1998.  For tax  years beginning after
December 31, 1997, the Puerto Rico tax credit will be fixed at 40% of the  level
allowed prior to the enactment of OBRA.
 
    The  Internal Revenue Service  ("IRS") has completed  its examination of the
Company's federal income tax returns for the years 1987 through 1989. As part of
this process, the Company received an examination report from the IRS in  August
1995, requesting a response within 30 days, which sets forth the adjustments the
IRS  is proposing for those  years. The Company has  filed a response protesting
the proposed  adjustments and  is awaiting  communication from  the IRS  Appeals
office.  The  proposed  adjustments  relate  primarily  to  the  tax  accounting
treatment of certain swaps and related transactions undertaken by the Company in
1987 and  1988. These  transactions resulted  in the  receipt of  cash in  those
years,  which the Company duly reported as  income for tax purposes. In 1989 (in
Notice 89-21), the IRS announced that it believed cash received in certain  swap
transactions  should be reported as income for tax purposes over the life of the
swaps, rather than when received. In the  case of the Company, this would  cause
some  of the income  to be reported  in years subject  to the Tax  Reform Act of
1986. The IRS proposed adjustment involves approximately $72 million in  federal
taxes for the years 1987 through 1989, plus interest. If the proposed adjustment
is  carried through to the  maturity of the transactions  in 1992, an additional
tax deficiency of approximately  $86 million, plus  interest, would result.  The
Company disagrees with the proposed adjustment and continues to believe that its
tax  accounting  treatment  for the  transactions  in question  was  proper. The
Company is  protesting  and appealing  the  proposed adjustments.  While  it  is
impossible  to determine  the final disposition,  the Company is  of the opinion
that the ultimate resolution of this  matter should not have a material  adverse
effect on the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.
 
    In  November  1994, Belgian  tax  authorities notified  Pfizer  Research and
Development Company N.V./S.A. ("PRDCO"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary  of
the  Company, of a proposed adjustment to the taxable income of PRDCO for fiscal
year 1992. The proposed adjustment arises  from an assertion by the Belgian  tax
authorities  of  jurisdiction with  respect to  income resulting  primarily from
certain transfers of property by non-Belgian subsidiaries of the Company to  the
Irish  branch of PRDCO. In  January 1995, PRDCO received  an assessment from the
tax authorities for additional taxes and interest of approximately $432  million
and $97 million, respectively, relating to these matters. In January 1996, PRDCO
received  an  assessment from  the tax  authorities, for  fiscal year  1993, for
additional taxes  and interest  of approximately  $86 million  and $18  million,
respectively.  The new assessment arises from  the same assertion by the Belgian
tax authorities of jurisdiction with respect  to all income of the Irish  branch
of  PRDCO. Based upon the relevant facts regarding the Irish branch of PRDCO and
the provisions of  Belgium tax laws  and the written  opinions of outside  legal
counsel, the Company believes that the assessments are wholly without merit.
 
    The  Company believes that its accrued  tax liabilities are adequate for all
open years.
 

PATENTS AND RESEARCH
 
    The Company owns or is  licensed under a number  of patents relating to  its
products and manufacturing processes which, in the aggregate, are believed to be
of material importance in its businesses. Based on current product sales, and in
view  of the vigorous competition with products sold by others, the Company does
not consider any single patent or related group of patents to be significant  in
relation  to the enterprise as a whole,  except for the Procardia XL, Zithromax,
Diflucan, Zoloft and Norvasc patents. Procardia XL employs a novel drug delivery
system developed  and  patented  by  Alza  Corporation.  The  Company  holds  an
exclusive  license to  use this delivery  system with nifedipine  until 2003. In
mid-1993, the FDA approved  a New Drug Application  (" NDA") for a  competitor's
sustained-release  form of  nifedipine for  the treatment  of hypertension. This
product uses a different  delivery system from the  patented technology used  in
Procardia  XL. Other forms of sustained-release nifedipine have been reported to
be in various stages of development  and in the marketplace by other  companies.
It  is not possible to predict the timing and impact on sales of Procardia XL of
possible future  competition. Zithromax  is a  novel, broad  spectrum  macrolide
antibiotic  patented by Pliva and exclusively  licensed to the Company for sales
and marketing in all major  countries of the world.  The U.S. product patent  on
Zithromax  (azithromycin) expires in 2005. The Company holds patents relating to
Diflucan, Zoloft, and Norvasc.
 
    The Company spent in excess of $1.4  billion in 1995, $1.1 billion in  1994,
and   $960  million  in  1993  on  Company-sponsored  research  and  development
throughout the world.  In 1996, the  Company plans to  spend approximately  $1.7
billion  on  research and  development. In  1991,  the Company  also established
Pfizer Research and Development Company (PRDCO) in Ireland. In 1992, the Company
provided PRDCO with  an initial  capitalization of approximately  $1 billion  to
enable  PRDCO  to  engage in  research  and development  through  a cost-sharing
arrangement with Pfizer Ltd. (a Pfizer U.K. subsidiary) in exchange for  PRDCO's
receiving  a portion of property rights  relating to the development of specific
products.
 
    Competition in  research,  involving the  development  of new  products  and
processes   and  the  improvement   of  existing  products   and  processes,  is
particularly significant and results  from time to time  in product and  process
obsolescence.  The development of new and  improved products is important to the
Company's success in all areas of its business.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
    As of December 31, 1995,  the Company employed approximately 43,800  persons
in  its continuing  operations throughout the  world as  follows: United States,
17,800;  Europe,  12,500;   Asia,  7,200;  Canada/Latin   America,  4,900;   and
Africa/Middle  East,  1,400.  The  Company  has  a  good  relationship  with its
employees. The Food Science business, which  was sold in January 1996,  employed
approximately 500 persons as of December 31, 1995.
 
REGULATION
 
    Most  of  the  Company's  businesses  are  subject  to  varying  degrees  of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted. Such
regulation in the United States involves a more complex product approval process
than in many  other countries  and therefore  often results  in later  marketing
clearances  and  a  corresponding increase  in  the expense  of  introducing new
products in  the  United  States.  In  many  international  markets,  prices  of
pharmaceuticals are controlled by the government.
 
    The 1990 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act requires pharmaceutical companies
to extend rebates to state Medicaid agencies based on each state's reimbursement
of  pharmaceutical products under the Medicaid program. The Veterans Health Care
Act, passed in 1992, requires manufacturers to provide discounts on purchases of
pharmaceutical products by  the Department  of Veterans Affairs  ("DVA") and  by
certain entities funded by the Public Health Service. The Company's net sales in
 

were  reduced by Medicaid rebates and rebates under related state programs which
amounted to $85 million.  In addition, in 1995,  Pfizer provided $80 million  in
discounts  to the federal government, primarily to the DVA and the Department of
Defense, for drugs purchased in accordance with the Veterans Health Care Act.
 
    In 1990, the  FDA announced  a call for  data for  ingredients contained  in
products  bearing anti-plaque and related  claims. The call for  data is part of
the FDA's ongoing review, begun in 1972, of OTC drug products. The FDA is taking
this administrative approach to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  anti-plaque
products and has not proceeded further with regard to 1989 regulatory letters it
issued  to  the  Company and  several  other manufacturers  of  products bearing
anti-plaque claims. The  Company submitted  its response  to the  call for  data
relating  to Plax, its pre-brushing dental rinse, on June 17, 1991. This filing,
as well  as  filings  of other  manufacturers,  is  still under  review  and  is
currently being considered by an FDA Advisory Panel.
 
    On  January 1, 1995,  the new European  Medicines Evaluation Agency ("EMEA")
instituted a new  drug-approval process for  the member states  of the  European
Union ("EU"). The EMEA provides two new drug-approval procedures. A "centralized
procedure"  supplements the traditional decentralized  approach and allows for a
single central approval that is valid in all EU states. The first such approval,
for a non-Pfizer pharmaceutical, was issued in 1995. While it is envisioned that
it will take several years for EMEA to be fully operational, it is expected that
a harmonized, centralized regulatory  agency in Europe  would offer benefits  to
the  human  and  veterinary drug  industries.  The Company  continues  to assess
developments in this area  and is implementing  strategies designed to  maximize
benefits to the Company's products.
 
    During  1995, Congress set aside its debate on reform of the U.S. healthcare
system and  focused on  balancing the  Federal  budget. As  part of  the  budget
process,  proposals  from  both  parties call  for  substantial  reforms  of the
Medicare and  Medicaid  programs.  As with  the  Congressional  coordination  of
healthcare  reform in  1994, Congress  has not,  to date,  been able  to reach a
consensus. If consensus is reached, and Medicare and/or Medicaid legislation  is
enacted,   it  may  require  significant  reductions  from  currently  projected
expenditures for  the  Medicare and  Medicaid  programs. Medicaid  managed  care
systems  driven by  budget concerns are  already under  consideration in several
states. If the Medicare  and Medicaid programs  implement systems that  severely
restrict  the access of  program participants to  innovative new medicines, this
could have a significant adverse effect on the Company.
 
RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY
 
    Raw materials essential to the business of the Company and its  subsidiaries
are  generally obtainable from multiple sources.  The Company did not experience
any significant restrictions on availability of raw materials or supplies during
the last year and none is expected in 1996. Energy was available to the  Company
in  sufficient quantities  to meet  Company requirements  and this  condition is
expected to continue in 1996.
 
ENVIRONMENT
 
    Certain of the Company's operations are affected by Federal, State and local
laws and regulations relating to environmental quality. The Company has made and
intends to continue to make the
 

necessary expenditures for environmental  protection. Compliance with such  laws
and  regulations  is not  expected  to have  a  material adverse  effect  on the
financial position or the results of operations of the Company.
 

 
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES
 
    Following is a  summary description  of the Company's  principal plants  and
properties:
 
    The  Company's world  headquarters is located  at 235 East  42nd Street, New
York, NY.  The  Company  owns  this  33-story  office  building  which  contains
approximately 650,000 square feet. The building stands on slightly less than one
acre  of land which is leased under an  agreement expiring in 2057. In 1983, the
Company purchased a nine-story office building located at 219 East 42nd  Street,
containing  approximately 263,400 square  feet which is  immediately adjacent to
the Company's headquarters. The Company  also leases additional office space  in
New York City consisting of approximately 111,000 square feet.
 
    All of the following properties are owned in fee by the Company.
 
    Groton  Research Laboratories and  Plant Facilities --  These facilities are
located in  Groton, Connecticut,  and surrounding  towns, on  approximately  649
acres,  and include a  number of buildings  of one to  eight stories, containing
approximately 3,088,000  square feet  of floor  space either  existing or  under
construction.
 
    In the research complex at Groton, construction of significant new buildings
is  continuing, with major expansion (116,000 square feet) of the pharmaceutical
research  and  development   facilities  scheduled  for   completion  in   1996.
Construction  was completed in  1993 on several  research expansions including a
156,000-square-foot  drug-safety   building   addition,   a   30,000-square-foot
central-utilities   building,  and   a  442,000-square-foot   parking  facility.
Principal products produced at Groton are bulk pharmaceuticals. Since  acquiring
the   plant  in  1946,  the  Company  has  made  major  improvements,  including
construction of production facilities, a powerhouse and generating equipment and
a large research complex adjacent to  the plant. In 1992, major improvements  to
plant  facilities were initiated,  including a process  effluent and waste water
treatment facility and a major pharmaceutical capacity replacement project. Both
projects are expected to be completed in 1996.
 
    Brooklyn  Plant  --  The  Company's  site  in  Brooklyn,  New  York,  is  on
approximately 17 acres, including a number of buildings containing approximately
596,000  square  feet of  floor  space. The  primary  operations, pharmaceutical
dosage-form manufacturing and packaging, are housed in an eight-story production
facility containing 545,000 square feet.
 
    Memphis  Logistics  Center  --  This  distribution  and  order   fulfillment
operation  is  located on  a 20-acre  site in  Memphis, Tennessee.  Three former
distribution centers  (Atlanta,  Chicago and  Dallas)  merged into  the  Memphis
Logistics Center in 1995, creating this geographically centralized facility. The
Center  provides the  Company with  262,440 square  feet of  warehouse space and
15,000 square  feet  of  office  space.  In  addition,  the  warehouse  has  the
capability of expanding by another 175,000 square feet. Besides distribution and
transportation  services,  the Memphis  facility is  also used  as a  center for
certain customer service operations of the Company.
 

    Vigo Plant and Research Facility -- These facilities, located in Vigo County
near Terre  Haute, Indiana,  are on  a  site of  approximately 2,000  acres  and
consist of a number of buildings of one to five stories containing approximately
575,000  square feet of  floor space. Principal products  produced at this plant
are pharmaceutical products and bulk antibiotics. Animal health research is also
performed on this site. The acreage and floor space reflect the sale of Pfizer's
Food Science Group to Cultor Ltd. The sale was consummated on January 28, 1996.
 
    Barceloneta Plant -- Pfizer  Pharmaceuticals Inc. is  located on an  89-acre
property  owned by  the Company at  Barceloneta, Puerto Rico.  An additional 151
acres of  land adjacent  to this  property  were purchased  in 1991  for  future
utilization.  An adjacent 9-acre site was  purchased in 1995 and integrated into
existing facilities. The facilities  contain four major manufacturing  buildings
(of  two to four floors)  and twelve support buildings  with a total approximate
area of 419,700 square feet of floor space; and ten additional facilities  (tank
farms, electrical substations, cooling towers, etc.) with an approximate area of
81,000  square feet, for a total  plant facilities area of approximately 500,700
square feet. The  plant houses organic  synthesis manufacturing,  pharmaceutical
dosage-form  manufacturing  and packaging  facilities  and the  required service
areas,  such  as  bulk  and   drum  liquid  storage,  laboratories,   utilities,
engineering shops, employee services and administration.
 
    Lincoln  Plant  and  Research  Facility and  Lee's  Summit  Facility  -- The
Company's principal Animal  Health facilities are  located in Lincoln,  Nebraska
and  Lee's Summit, Missouri. The  extensive Lincoln property encompasses 850,651
square feet, including a biological production facility covering 285,348  square
feet of floor space, a pharmaceutical production facility covering 87,640 square
feet,  18  satellite buildings  and two  offsite  research farms.  Operations at
Lincoln include a manufacturing center for biological and pharmaceutical  animal
health products, and a research and development center for biological products.
 
    The  Lee's Summit Facility is  located on a site  of approximately 104 acres
owned by the  Company in  the City of  Lee's Summit,  Jackson County,  Missouri.
There  are five major buildings on  the site of one to  five floors with a total
floor space  of approximately  215,000 square  feet. Primary  operations at  the
facility  are  manufacturing  and  packaging  of  sterile  injectible  products,
blending  and  packaging   of  medicated  premix   products,  and   distribution
operations.
 
    Other  U.S.  Locations  --  The Company  also  operates  9  other production
facilities in the  United States  and has five  regional sales  centers and  two
additional  distribution centers in various parts of the country which are owned
in fee.
 
    Outside the United  States -- The  Company's major manufacturing  facilities
outside  the United  States are  located in  Australia, Belgium,  Brazil, China,
France, Germany,  Great  Britain,  India,  Ireland,  Italy,  Japan,  Mexico  and
Venezuela.  The plants in these thirteen countries have an aggregate of over 2.5
million square feet of floor  space. Other plants are  located in over 16  other
countries around the world.
 
    Sandwich  -- A large medicinal and animal health research unit is located in
Sandwich, England where an 82,000-square-foot clinical-sciences building  became
operational  in 1993  and a  99,000-square-foot animal-sciences  building became
operational in early 1994.  Construction of a 97,000-square-foot  pharmaceutical
sciences  building is in the advanced stage of completion. An effluent treatment
plant is also under construction for this site.
 
    Ringaskiddy -- The  Ringaskiddy facility  in Ireland  comprises three  fully
operational  bulk  organic  synthesis  manufacturing  plants  which  are  of key
importance to bulk organic substance sourcing. The last unit began operating  in
early 1995 and is now operating at design capacity. Ringaskiddy manufactures the
majority of bulk products required by the International Pharmaceuticals Group in
its  worldwide  dosage-form operations.  These  manufacturing plants,  which are
computer controlled,  provide considerable  flexibility  in supplying  both  the
current  and foreseeable requirements  for the Group. The  facility also has the
capacity  to  support  the  manufacture   of  substances  being  developed   for
 

future  products. Ringaskiddy's manufacturing operations are self-supported by a
modern and  efficient  infrastructure,  providing such  services  as  utilities,
quality assurance, environmental treatment systems and maintenance.
 
    Nagoya  --  The Nagoya  facility  in Japan  encompasses  several significant
individual operations  in addition  to its  research function  and is  the  sole
supplier  of certain bulk  substances. Fermentation, bulk  organic synthesis and
dosage-form  manufacturing  are  important  to  the  supply  of  the   Company's
operations in Japan (the country with the largest sales after the United States)
as  well as elsewhere in the world.  Various facilities on the site are computer
controlled  and,  similar  to  Ringaskiddy,  the  manufacturing  operations  are
self-supported  by utility services,  quality assurance, environmental treatment
systems and maintenance functions. Manufacturing facilities for fermentation and
refining are being  expanded to  meet the  growing demand  for specialized  drug
substances and are expected to be operational by the end of 1996.
 
    In  addition to  the facilities  outlined above,  research laboratories also
exist in France and Germany.
 
    The Company's  major manufacturing  facilities  in the  U.S. and  the  other
locations  referred  to  above  manufacture  various  products  for  all  of the
Company's  businesses.  These  properties  are  maintained  in  good   operating
condition  and the manufacturing facilities  have capacities considered adequate
to meet the Company's needs.
 
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
    The Company is  involved in a  number of claims  and litigations,  including
product  liability claims and litigations considered normal in the nature of its
businesses. These include  suits involving various  pharmaceutical and  hospital
products that allege either reaction to or injury from use of the product.
 
    As  previously  disclosed, numerous  claims  have been  brought  against the
Company and  Shiley Incorporated,  a wholly  owned subsidiary,  alleging  either
personal injury from fracture of 60 DEG. or 70 DEG. Shiley Convexo-Concave (C/C)
heart  valves,  or  anxiety  that properly  functioning  implanted  valves might
fracture in the future or personal  injury from a prophylactic replacement of  a
functioning valve.
 
    In  an  attempt  to  resolve  all  claims  alleging  anxiety  that  properly
functioning valves might  fracture in  the future,  the Company  entered into  a
settlement  agreement  in January  1992 in  Bowling  v. Shiley,  et al.,  a case
brought in the United States District  Court for the Southern District of  Ohio,
that  establishes a worldwide  settlement class of people  with C/C heart valves
and their spouses, except those who elect to exclude themselves. The  settlement
provides  for a Consultation Fund  of $90 million to  $140 million (depending on
the number of  claims filed) from  which valve recipients  who make claims  will
receive  payments that  are intended  to cover  their cost  of consultation with
cardiologists or other health care providers  with respect to their valves.  The
settlement  agreement  establishes a  second  fund of  at  least $75  million to
support C/C valve-related research, including  the development of techniques  to
identify  valve recipients  who may  have significant  risk of  fracture, and to
cover the  unreimbursed medical  expenses that  valve recipients  may incur  for
certain  procedures  related  to  the valves.  The  Company's  obligation  as to
coverage of these  unreimbursed medical expenses  is not subject  to any  dollar
limitation.  Following  a hearing  on  the fairness  of  the settlement,  it was
approved by the court on August 19,  1992. An appeal of the court's approval  of
the  settlement was dismissed on December 21, 1993 by the United States Court of
Appeals for the  Sixth Circuit. A  motion for  rehearing en banc  was denied  on
March 4, 1994, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari on October
3,  1994. On  August 8,  1994, the  Sixth Circuit  dismissed an  appeal from the
denial of a motion by the same  appellants to vacate the judgment approving  the
settlement, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari on January 9,
1995.  Another appeal to the Sixth Circuit  by the same appellants regarding the
denial of their earlier motion to intervene is pending. It is expected that most
of the  costs arising  from the  Bowling  class settlement  will be  covered  by
insurance and the proceeds of
 

the  sale  of  certain  product  lines of  the  Shiley  businesses  in  1992. Of
approximately 900 implantees (and spouses of some of them) who opted out of  the
Bowling  settlement class, nine have cases  pending; approximately 792 have been
resolved; and approximately 100 have never filed a case or claim.
 
    Several claims relating  to elective  reoperations of  valve recipients  are
currently  pending. Some of these claims relate to elective reoperations covered
by the Bowling class settlement  described above, and, therefore, the  claimants
are  entitled  to  certain  benefits in  accordance  with  the  settlement. Such
claimants, if they irrevocably waive all of the benefits of the settlement,  may
pursue  separate litigation to recover damages in spite of the class settlement.
The Company is defending these claims.
 
    Generally, the  plaintiffs in  all of  the pending  heart valve  litigations
discussed  above seek money damages.  Based on the experience  of the Company in
defending these claims to date, including available insurance and reserves,  the
Company  is of the opinion that these actions should not have a material adverse
effect on the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.
 
    On September 30, 1993, Dairyland  Insurance Co., a carrier providing  excess
liability coverage ("excess carrier") in the early 1980s, commenced an action in
the  California Superior Court in Orange  County, seeking a declaratory judgment
that it was not obligated to  provide insurance coverage for Shiley heart  valve
liability  claims.  On October  8, 1993,  Pfizer filed  cross-complaints against
Dairyland and filed third-party complaints against 73 other excess carriers  who
sold  excess  liability policies  covering periods  from  1978 to  1985, seeking
damages and declaratory judgments that they are obligated to pay for defense and
indemnity to the  extent not paid  by other carriers.  Several such claims  have
been resolved and the remainder are involved in pretrial discovery.
 
    The  Company's operations are  subject to federal,  state, local and foreign
environmental  laws  and  regulations.  Under  the  Comprehensive  Environmental
Response,  Compensation,  and Liability  Act of  1980,  as amended  ("CERCLA" or
"Superfund"), the Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party
by the United  States Environmental  Protection Agency with  respect to  certain
waste  sites with which the Company may have had direct or indirect involvement.
Similar designations have been made  by some state environmental agencies  under
applicable  state superfund laws.  Such designations are  made regardless of the
extent of the Company's involvement. There are also claims that the Company  may
be a responsible party or participant with respect to several waste site matters
in  foreign  jurisdictions.  Such claims  have  been  made by  the  filing  of a
complaint, the issuance of an administrative directive or order, or the issuance
of  a  notice  or  demand  letter.  These  claims  are  in  various  stages   of
administrative  or judicial  proceedings. They  include demands  for recovery of
past governmental costs  and for  future investigative or  remedial actions.  In
many  cases, the  dollar amount of  the claim  is not specified.  In most cases,
claims have  been asserted  against a  number  of other  entities for  the  same
recovery  or other relief  as was asserted  against the Company.  The Company is
currently participating in remedial action at  a number of sites under  federal,
state, local and foreign laws.
 
    To  the extent possible with the  limited amount of information available at
this time, the Company  has evaluated its responsibility  for costs and  related
liability  with  respect to  the  above sites  and is  of  the opinion  that the
Company's liability  with respect  to these  sites should  not have  a  material
adverse  effect on the  financial position or  the results of  operations of the
Company. In arriving at this conclusion, the Company has considered, among other
things, the payments that have been made with respect to the sites in the  past;
the  factors,  such  as  volume and  relative  toxicity,  ordinarily  applied to
allocate defense and remedial costs at such sites; the probable costs to be paid
by the other potentially responsible parties; total projected remedial costs for
a site,  if known;  existing  technology; and  the  currently enacted  laws  and
regulations.  The Company anticipates that a  portion of these costs and related
liability will be covered by available insurance.
 
    Through the early  1970s, Pfizer  (Minerals Division)  and Quigley  Company,
Inc.,  a  wholly owned  subsidiary, sold  a minimal  amount of  one construction
product and several  refractory products containing  some asbestos. These  sales
were  discontinued thereafter. Although  these sales represented  a minor market
share, the Company has been named as  one of a number of defendants in  numerous
 

lawsuits.  These  actions, and  actions related  to the  Company's sale  of talc
products  in  the  past,  claim  personal  injury  resulting  from  exposure  to
asbestos-containing  products, and nearly all seek general and punitive damages.
In these  actions, the  Company  or Quigley  is typically  one  of a  number  of
defendants,  and  both are  members  of the  Center  for Claims  Resolution (the
"CCR"), a  joint defense  organization of  twenty defendants  that is  defending
these claims. The Company and Quigley are responsible for varying percentages of
defense  and liability payments for  all members of the  CCR. Prior to September
1990, the  cases involving  talc products  were  defended by  the CCR,  but  the
Company  is now overseeing its  own defense of these  actions. A number of cases
alleging  property  damage  from   asbestos-containing  products  installed   in
buildings have also been brought against Pfizer.
 
    On  January 15, 1993, a class action complaint and settlement agreement were
filed  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of
Pennsylvania  involving  all personal  injury claims  by  persons who  have been
exposed to asbestos-containing products  but who have not  yet filed a  personal
injury  action  against  the  members  of  the  CCR.  The  settlement  agreement
establishes a claims-processing mechanism that will provide historic  settlement
values  upon proof  of impaired medical  condition as  well as claims-processing
rates over  ten years.  In addition,  the shares  allocated to  the CCR  members
eliminate  joint  and  several  liability. The  court  has  determined  that the
settlement is fair and reasonable. Subsequently, the court entered an injunction
enforcing its determination. An  appeal from that injunction  is pending in  the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
 
    At  approximately the time it filed the  future claims class action, the CCR
settled approximately  16,360 personal  injury cases  on behalf  of its  members
including  Pfizer and  Quigley. The  CCR has  continued to  settle remaining and
opt-out cases  and claims  on a  similar basis  to past  settlements. The  total
pending number of cases as of December 31, 1995 is 14,305 asbestos cases against
Quigley;  5,764 asbestos  cases against Pfizer  Inc.; and 70  talc cases against
Pfizer Inc.
 
    Costs incurred  by the  Company in  defending the  asbestos personal  injury
claims  and the property damage claims, as well as settlements and damage awards
in connection therewith, are  largely insured against  under policies issued  by
several primary insurance carriers and a number of excess carriers.
 
    The  Company believes  that its costs  incurred in  defending and ultimately
disposing of the asbestos personal injury claims, as well as the property damage
claims, will be largely  covered by insurance policies  issued by carriers  that
have  agreed to provide coverage, subject to deductibles, exclusions, retentions
and policy  limits.  In  connection  with  the  future  claims  settlement,  the
defendants  have commenced a third-party  action against their respective excess
insurance  carriers  that  have  not  agreed  to  provide  coverage  seeking   a
declaratory  judgment  that  (a)  the  future  claims  settlement  is  fair  and
reasonable as  to the  carriers; (b)  the carriers  had adequate  notice of  the
future  claims class settlement;  and (c) the carriers  are obligated to provide
coverage for asbestos personal injury claims. Based on the Company's  experience
in  defending the claims to date and the amount of insurance coverage available,
the Company is  of the opinion  that the  actions should not  ultimately have  a
material  adverse effect on the financial  position or the results of operations
of the Company.
 
    The United  States  Environmental Protection  Agency  -- Region  1  and  the
Department  of Justice have informed the  Company that the federal government is
contemplating an enforcement  action arising  primarily out of  a December  1993
multimedia  environmental inspection, as  well as certain  state inspections, of
the  Company's  Groton,  Connecticut  facility.   The  Company  is  engaged   in
discussions  with  the  governmental  agencies  and  does  not  believe  that an
enforcement action,  if brought,  will have  a material  adverse effect  on  the
financial position or the results of operations of the Company.
 
    The  Company has been  named, together with  numerous other manufacturers of
brand name prescription drugs and  certain companies that distribute brand  name
prescription  drugs, in  suits in  federal and  state courts  brought by various
groups of retail pharmacy companies. The federal cases consist principally of  a
class   action   by  retail   pharmacies   (including  approximately   30  named
plaintiffs)(the  Federal  Class  Action),  as  well  as  additional  actions  by
approximately  3,500  individual  retail pharmacies  and  a group  of  chain and
supermarket   pharmacies    (the    "individual    actions").    These    cases,
 

which have been transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern
District  of Illinois  and coordinated  for pretrial  purposes, allege  that the
defendant drug manufacturers  violated the  Sherman Act  by unlawfully  agreeing
with  each other (and, as alleged in some cases, with wholesalers) not to extend
to retail pharmacy companies the same discounts allegedly extended to mail order
pharmacies,  managed  care  companies  and  certain  other  customers,  and   by
unlawfully  discriminating against  retail pharmacy  companies by  not extending
them such discounts. On November 15,  1994, the federal court certified a  class
(the  Federal Class  Action) consisting  of all  persons or  entities who, since
October 15, 1989, bought brand name prescription drugs from any manufacturer  or
wholesaler defendant, but specifically excluding government entities, mail order
pharmacies,  HMOs, hospitals,  clinics and  nursing homes.  Fifteen manufacturer
defendants, including  the Company,  have  agreed to  settle the  Federal  Class
Action  subject to court approval. The Company's share, pursuant to an Agreement
as of January 31, 1996, is  $31.25 million, payable in four annual  installments
without interest. The Company continues to believe that there was no conspiracy,
and specifically denies liability in the Settlement Agreement, but has agreed to
settle  to avoid the monetary and other  costs of litigation. The Settlement was
filed with the Court on February 9, 1996. A hearing was held on February 14, and
the settlement was preliminarily approved and  a final fairness hearing was  set
for  March 27. The Court has tentatively  scheduled the Federal Class Action for
trial commencing May 7, 1996. No other action has been scheduled for trial.
 
    In addition,  consumer  class  actions  have been  filed  in  state  courts,
alleging  injury to consumers as  well as retail pharmacies  from the failure to
give discounts  to  retail pharmacy  companies.  Both  a consumer  class  and  a
retailer  class  have been  certified in  separate California  actions. Consumer
class actions filed in Colorado and Washington have been dismissed, and are  now
on  appeal. The Company was dismissed from a consumer class action in Wisconsin,
but a determination of the finality of that dismissal is pending. Consumer class
actions are also  pending in Alabama,  Arizona, Maine, Michigan,  and New  York.
Retailer class actions are also pending in Alabama and Minnesota.
 
    The  Company believes  that these  cases, which  generally seek  damages and
certain injunctive relief, are without merit.
 
    Schneider (USA) Inc.  and Schneider  (Europe) AG have  been named,  together
with  Advanced  Cardiovascular  Systems,  Inc., in  a  federal  antitrust action
brought on January  2, 1996, by  Boston Scientific Corporation  and SciMed  Life
Systems,  Inc. (a subsidiary  of Boston Scientific) in  the U.S. District Court,
District of  Massachusetts .  The suit  alleges that  the defendants  unlawfully
obtained  and  enforced  certain  patents  covering  rapid  exchange angioplasty
catheters, and conspired  against the  plaintiffs by,  among other  allegations,
their settlement of patent infringement litigation in December of 1991. The suit
seeks  unspecified treble  damages and  injunctive relief.  The Company believes
that the case is without merit.
 
    FDA administrative proceedings relating to Plax are pending, principally  an
industry-wide call for data on all anti-plaque products by the FDA. The call for
data  notice specified that products that have been marketed for a material time
and to a  material extent may  remain on the  market pending FDA  review of  the
data,  provided the  manufacturer has  a good faith  belief that  the product is
generally recognized as safe  and effective and is  not misbranded. The  Company
believes  that Plax satisfied these requirements  and prepared a response to the
FDA's request, which was  filed on June  17, 1991. This filing,  as well as  the
filings  of other  manufacturers, is still  under review and  is currently being
considered by an FDA Advisory Committee.
 
    A consolidated class  action on  behalf of persons  who allegedly  purchased
Pfizer  common stock during the March 24,  1989 through February 26, 1990 period
is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of  New
York.  This lawsuit, which commenced on July  13, 1990, alleges that the Company
and  certain  officers  and  former  directors  and  officers  violated  federal
securities  law  by  failing  to disclose  potential  liability  arising  out of
personal injury suits  involving Shiley  heart valves  and seeks  damages in  an
unspecified  amount.  The defendants  in this  action believe  that the  suit is
without merit. A derivative action commenced  on April 2, 1990, against  certain
directors and officers
 

and  former directors and officers alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and other
common law violations  in connection  with the manufacture  and distribution  of
Shiley heart valves is pending in the Superior Court, Orange County, California.
The  complaint seeks,  among other  forms of  relief, damages  in an unspecified
amount. The defendants in the action believe that the suit is without merit.
 
    A purported class action entitled Bradshaw v. Pfizer Inc. and Howmedica Inc.
is pending in  the U.S. District  Court, Northern District  of Ohio. The  action
seeks monetary and injunctive relief, including medical monitoring, on behalf of
patients implanted with the Howmedica P.C.A. one-piece acetabular hip component,
which  was manufactured  by Howmedica from  1983 to 1990.  The complaint alleges
that the  prostheses  were  defectively  designed  and  manufactured  and  posed
undisclosed  risks to implantees.  The federal magistrate  judge has recommended
that the district court  deny the plaintiffs'  motion to certify  the case as  a
class action. The Company believes that the suit is without merit.
 
    From 1994 to 1995, seven purported class actions were filed against American
Medical  Systems  ("AMS")  in  federal  courts  in  South  Carolina, California,
Minnesota (2), Indiana,  Ohio and  Louisiana. The California,  Ohio and  Indiana
suits  and one Minnesota suit also name Pfizer Inc. as a defendant, based on its
ownership of AMS. The suits seek monetary and injunctive relief on the basis  of
allegations  that implantable penile  prostheses are prone  to unreasonably high
rates of mechanical failure  and/or various autoimmune diseases  as a result  of
silicone  materials.  On  September  30, 1994,  the  federal  Judicial  Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation denied the  various plaintiffs' motions to  consolidate
or  coordinate the  cases for  pretrial proceedings.  On February  28, 1995, the
Court in  the  Ohio suit  conditionally  granted plaintiffs'  motion  for  class
certification;  on  March  3, 1995,  the  court  in the  California  suit denied
plaintiffs' motion for class certification; and  on October 25, 1995, the  court
in  the  Indiana  suit denied  plaintiffs'  motion for  class  certification; on
February 15,  1996 the  United States  Court of  Appeals for  the Sixth  Circuit
reversed  the Ohio Court's  conditional certification. The  Company believes the
suits are without merit.
 
    In June, 1993, the  Ministry of Justice  of the State  of Sao Paulo,  Brazil
commenced  a  civil public  action against  the Company's  Brazilian subsidiary,
Laboratorios Pfizer  Ltda. (Pfizer  Brazil) asserting  that during  a period  in
1991,  Pfizer Brazil  withheld sale of  the pharmaceutical  product Diabinese in
violation of antitrust and consumer protection laws. The action seeks the  award
of  moral, economic  and personal  damages to individuals  and the  payment to a
public reserve fund.  On February  8, 1996, the  trial court  issued a  decision
holding  Pfizer  Brazil liable.  The  award of  damages  to individuals  and the
payment into the public reserve fund will be determined in a subsequent phase of
the proceedings. The trial  court's opinion sets out  a formula for  calculating
the  payment  into  the public  reserve  fund which  could  result in  a  sum of
approximately $88  million. The  total  amount of  damages payable  to  eligible
individuals  under the decision would depend on the number of persons eventually
making claims. Pfizer Brazil  is appealing this  decision. The Company  believes
that  this action is without merit and should not have a material adverse effect
on the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.
