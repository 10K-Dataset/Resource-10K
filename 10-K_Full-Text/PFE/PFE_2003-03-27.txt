PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Pfizer Inc. (which may be referred to as

Pfizer, the Company, we

,

us

or

our

) is a research-based, global pharmaceutical company. We discover, develop,
manufacture and market leading prescription medicines for humans and animals as
well as many of the world’s best-known over-the-counter products.

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on
June 2, 1942.

In July 2002, we entered into an agreement to acquire Pharmacia
Corporation. See

Proposed Acquisition of Pharmacia Corporation

below.

In late 2002 and early 2003, we sold the Tetra fish-care products business
and entered into agreements to sell the Adams confectionery products business
and the Schick-Wilkinson Sword shaving products business, all of which formerly
were part of our Consumer Products segment. In early 2003, we also entered into
an agreement to sell certain of our women’s health product lines (

femhrt

hormone-replacement therapy and

Loestrin

and

Estrostep

contraceptives), which
formerly were part of our Pharmaceutical segment. All of these divested or
to-be-divested businesses and product lines are reflected as discontinued
operations in our consolidated financial statements for 2002, 2001 and 2000 and
in this 2002 Form 10-K. See

Discontinued Operations

below.

On June 19, 2000, we completed our merger with Warner-Lambert Company
(Warner-Lambert). We issued approximately 2.44 billion shares of common stock
in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of Warner-Lambert. The merger
qualified as a tax-free reorganization and was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. We restated all consolidated financial statements of Pfizer for
periods prior to the merger to include the results of operations, financial
position and cash flows of Warner-Lambert as if we had always been merged.

Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries where we
operate. In the U.S., the main regulatory authority we deal with is the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of the
products we offer, our research quality, our manufacturing processes and our
promotion and advertising. Similar government authorities exist in most other
countries, and in many cases also regulate our prices. See

Government
Regulation and Price Constraints

below.

Pharmaceutical Segment

Our Pharmaceutical segment includes our human pharmaceutical and animal
health businesses, as well as Capsugel, a capsule- manufacturing business.

Human Pharmaceutical

Most of our human pharmaceutical revenues come from products in three
major therapeutic classes: cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases and
central nervous system disorders. We also have products for the treatment of
diabetes, urogenital conditions, allergies and other disorders, as well as
copromoted products for arthritis, acute pain and menstrual pain. In 2002,
human pharmaceutical revenues increased 12%, to $28.3 billion. Human
pharmaceutical revenues contributed 87% of our revenues in each of 2002 and
2001 and 86% in 2000. We marketed ten human pharmaceutical products, including
our copromoted products

Celebrex

and

Aricept

, with sales to third parties
exceeding $1 billion each in 2002. Those ten products —

Lipitor

,

Norvasc

,

Zoloft

,

Neurontin

,

Celebrex, Viagra

,

Zithromax

,

Zyrtec

,

Diflucan

and

Aricept

—
represented 85% of human pharmaceutical revenues and grew at a combined rate of
15% in 2002. A table captioned

Revenues — Major Human Pharmaceutical Products

on page 31 of our 2002 Annual Report is incorporated by reference.

Cardiovascular disease products that treat problems affecting the heart
and the blood circulatory system make up our largest therapeutic product line.

Lipitor

, our largest-selling product, is for treatment of high lipids
(cholesterol and triglycerides) in the bloodstream. It is the largest-selling
prescription drug of any kind in the world. In 2002, the FDA approved two new
starting doses of

Liptor

, enabling physicians to better tailor therapy
individually across a broad range of patients.

Norvasc

is a once-a-day
medication for hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina (heart pain). It
is the largest-selling high blood pressure and heart pain medicine in the
world. Our other cardiovascular products include

Cardura

and

Accupril/Accuretic

.

Cardura

is used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic
hyperplasia (enlarged prostate gland).

Accupril/Accuretic

is an angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for hypertension and congestive heart
failure.

In the infectious disease medicine category, our major products include

Zithromax

,

Diflucan

and

Viracept

.

Zithromax,

an oral or injectable antibiotic,
is the second-largest-selling antibiotic worldwide and the most-prescribed,
brand-name, oral antibiotic in the U.S. In 2002, we launched the



new

Zithromax Tri-Pak

dosage form, the first and only three-day regimen
for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

Zithromax

is licensed exclusively to us by Pliva, a Croatian
pharmaceutical company.

Diflucan

is the world’s leading systemic antifungal. It
is used to treat various fungal infections, including vaginal infections and
certain infections that afflict HIV/AIDS and cancer patients with weakened
immune systems. Complementing

Diflucan

is

Vfend

, a treatment that can be
administered orally or intravenously for certain serious and potentially fatal
fungal infections.

Vfend

was launched in the U.S. in July 2002 and in Europe
during the latter part of the year.

Viracept

is the largest-selling protease
inhibitor in the U.S., used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for
treatment of HIV/AIDS infections. We market

Viracept

in the U.S. and
Canada.

Our major products for treatment of central nervous system disorders
include

Zoloft

,

Neurontin

and

Geodon

and the copromoted product

Aricept

.

Zoloft

is the most-prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in the
U.S. and a leading medicine worldwide for the treatment of depression, panic
disorder, obsessive/compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder,
premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and acute and long-term treatment for social
anxiety disorder (for which it was approved in February 2003).

Neurontin

is a
leading epilepsy medicine, approved as an add-on therapy with other
anti-epileptic medications to treat partial seizures in patients over three
years of age. It also is approved in more than 60 markets for the treatment of
neuropathic pain. In 2002,

Neurontin

became the first oral medication approved
in the U.S. to treat post-herpetic neuralgia, a persistent, painful condition
that afflicts many people in the aftermath of shingles.

Geodon

(known as

Zeldox

in many markets outside the U.S.) is for the treatment of symptoms associated
with schizophrenia. In 2002, we launched an intramuscular formulation of

Geodon

, used to treat agitated or hospitalized patients, in the U.S.

Aricept

,
discovered and developed by Eisai Co., Ltd., is the world’s leading medicine to
treat symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. We copromote

Aricept

with Eisai in the
U.S. and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the drug
in various other countries. Our other products for central nervous system
disorders include

Relpax

and the copromoted product

Rebif

.

Relpax

, an oral
treatment for acute migraine headaches, is marketed throughout Europe and in
Japan. It was approved in the U.S. in December 2002 and launched in the U.S.
during the first quarter of 2003.

Rebif,

discovered and developed by Serono
S.A., is used to treat symptoms of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In
2002, we entered into an agreement with Serono to copromote

Rebif

in the U.S.

Viagra

, our medication for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, is the
most widely prescribed medication in the world for the treatment of this
condition.

We copromote two medicines for the treatment of arthritis and certain
other conditions,

Celebrex

and

Bextra

, with Pharmacia Corporation, which
discovered and developed the drugs.

Celebrex

is used for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, acute pain, menstrual pain and familial
adenomatous polyposis.

Bextra

was launched in the U.S. in 2002 for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and menstrual pain. During
2002, regulatory authorities adopted a positive opinion for granting market
authorization for

Bextra

in the European Union and, subject to receiving final
approval, launch is planned in Europe for 2003.

Zyrtec

is used for the treatment of year-round indoor and seasonal outdoor
allergies and hives. It is indicated for use in children as young as six months
old.

Zyrtec

syrup is the most-prescribed antihistamine syrup in the U.S., and

Zyrtec-D 12 Hour

is the only prescription oral antihistamine/decongestant
combination medicine approved to treat both year-round indoor and outdoor
allergies as well as nasal congestion.

Zyrtec

is licensed to us by the Belgian
company UCB S.A. We copromote

Zyrtec

as a prescription medicine in the U.S.
with a subsidiary of UCB S.A., and we have a license to sell

Zyrtec

as an
over-the-counter (OTC) medicine in Canada, Europe, Australia and South Africa.

Glucotrol XL

is used to treat diabetes. It is an oral medicine that
stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin.

Spiriva

is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a
respiratory disorder



that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. We copromote

Spiriva

with
Boehringer Ingelheim, which discovered and developed the drug. It was launched
in Europe in 2002 and in Canada in January 2003. In December 2002,

Spiriva

received an approvable letter from the FDA for the long-term, once-daily
maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with COPD.

Animal Health

Our Animal Health business discovers, develops and sells
products for the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock and
companion animals. Animal Health revenues accounted for 4% of our revenues
in each of 2002, 2001 and 2000. In 2002, Animal Health
revenues increased 10%, to $1.1 billion.

Among the products we market are parasiticides, anti-inflammatories,
vaccines, antibiotics and related medicines for livestock and companion
animals, including the products discussed below.

Parasiticides constitute the largest segment of the companion animal
market, consisting mainly of medicines for external parasites, such as fleas,
and heartworm preventatives. Our product

Revolution

is the first FDA-approved
topical medicine that protects against fleas and heartworm in a simple,
once-a-month administration.

Rimadyl

relieves pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, a
condition that afflicts about 20% of adult dogs.

Rimadyl

is the only arthritis
pain medication prescribed by veterinarians available in chewable tablets as
well as regular caplets.

RespiSure/Stellamune

is a single-dose vaccine used to treat pneumonia in
swine.

Dectomax

injectable and pour-on formulations remove and control internal
and external parasites in beef cattle.

Capsugel

Capsugel is the world’s largest producer of two-piece capsules used in
manufacturing prescription and OTC pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements.
Capsugel’s sales accounted for about 1% of our revenues in each of 2002, 2001
and 2000. In 2002, Capsugel’s revenues increased 6%, to $436 million.

Consumer Products Segment

Our Consumer Products segment consists of our Consumer Healthcare business
(CHC), one of the world’s largest suppliers of OTC medicines.

CHC markets many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare brands. Sales
of CHC accounted for 8% of our revenues in each of 2002 and 2001 and 9% of our
revenues in 2000. In 2002, revenues of CHC increased 7%, to $2.5 billion.

CHC’s products compete primarily in the oral care, upper respiratory
health, eye care, skin care and gastrointestinal health categories. CHC’s
principal products include:

CHC can extend the life of some of our prescription medications by
converting them to OTC medications. For example, an OTC formulation of

Diflucan

, known as

Diflucan One

, is sold in the U.K. as a treatment for vaginal
candidiasis. Similarly,

Zyrtec

is sold as an OTC product in certain markets
outside the U.S. As market conditions permit, and when we have necessary
approval from drug regulatory authorities, we plan to pursue similar launches
for other products.



Discontinued Operations

We sold or are in the process of selling the following businesses and
product lines that do not fit our strategic goals:

•

In December 2002, we sold the Tetra fish-care products business, formerly
part of our Consumer Products segment, for $238.5 million in cash.

•

In December 2002, we entered into an agreement to sell the Adams
confectionery products business, formerly part of our Consumer Products
segment, for $4.2 billion in cash.

•

In January 2003, we entered into an agreement to sell the
Schick-Wilkinson Sword business, formerly part of our Consumer Products
segment, for $930 million in cash.

•

In March 2003, we entered into an agreement to sell certain of our
women’s health product lines (

femhrt

hormone-replacement therapy and

Loestrin

and

Estrostep

contraceptives), formerly part of our
Pharmaceutical segment. The sale price is $359 million in cash, with an
additional cash payment of up to $125 million contingent on

femhrt

and

Estrostep

retaining market exclusivity until the expiration of their
respective patents.

The divestitures of the Adams and Schick-Wilkinson Sword businesses and
the women’s health product lines are expected to close in the first half of
2003 and are subject to the usual regulatory approvals.

Certain financial information relating to these divested or to-be-divested
businesses and product lines is set forth in Note 4 to our consolidated
financial statements,

Discontinued Operations

, on page 51 of our 2002 Annual
Report. That information is incorporated by reference.

Research and Product Development

Innovation by our research and development operations is very important to
the Company’s success. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market
innovative products that address major unmet medical needs. This goal has been
supported by our substantial research and development investments. We spent
$5.2 billion in 2002, $4.8 billion in 2001 and $4.4 billion in 2000 on research
and development.

We conduct research internally, and also through contracts with third
parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies
and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms. We also seek out innovative
technologies developed by third parties to acquire or incorporate into our
discovery or development processes or projects as well as our product lines through licensing or other arrangements.

Drug
discovery and development is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. On
average, only one out of many thousands of chemical compounds discovered by
researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an
approved medicine. The process from discovery to development to regulatory approval can take
more than ten years. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process.
Candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of
research.

We believe that our investments in research have been rewarded by the
number of pharmaceutical compounds and new therapies we have in all stages of
development; we currently are working on more than 160 projects in development
and several hundred projects in discovery research. In recent years, our discovery
scientists have delivered dozens of new chemical compounds to early
development. While these new candidates may or may not eventually receive
regulatory approval, new drug candidates entering development are the foundation for future
products.

In addition to discovering and developing new products, our research
operations add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness
and by discovering new uses for them. In February 2003, for example, the FDA
approved the additional use of

Zoloft

for the treatment of social anxiety
disorder.

Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development as
well as supplemental filings for existing products is set forth under the
heading

Product Developments

on pages 33 and 34 of our 2002 Annual Report. That
information is incorporated by reference. In February 2003, we
submitted an application to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency
for approval of our developmental compound

pregabalin

for the
treatment of neuropathic pain and for use with other medications in
the treatment of epilepsy. We expect to submit an application to the
FDA for the use of

pregabalin

for those conditions, as well as
for generalized anxiety disorder, later this year.

Our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to research
and development. In addition, the consolidation that has occurred in our



industry has created companies with substantial research and development
resources. The extent to which our competitors are successful in their research
could result in erosion of the sales of our products and unanticipated product
obsolescence.

International Operations

We have significant operations outside the United States. They are
conducted both through our subsidiaries and through distributors, and involve
the same business segments — pharmaceutical and consumer products — as our U.S.
operations.

Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $11.6 billion accounted for
35.9% of our total revenues in 2002. Revenues exceeded $500 million in each of
seven countries outside the U.S. in 2002. No single country outside the U.S.
contributed more than 10% of our total revenues. Japan is our second-largest
national market, with 6.1% of our revenues in 2002, 6.2% in 2001 and 6.6% in
2000.

For a geographic breakdown of revenues and changes in revenues, see the
table captioned

Geographic

in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements,

Segment, Geographic and Revenue Information,

on page 65 of our 2002 Annual
Report and the table captioned

Percentage Change in Geographic Revenues

on page
31 of our 2002 Annual Report. Those tables are incorporated by reference.

Our international businesses are subject, in varying degrees, to a number
of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. These include

•     currency fluctuations

•     capital and exchange control regulations

•     expropriation and nationalization

•     other restrictive government actions

Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed
constraints, including laws on pricing or reimbursement for use of products.
See

Government Regulation and Price Constraints

below for discussion of these
matters.

Depending on the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign
currency values can increase or reduce the reported dollar value of our net
assets and results of operations. In 2002, foreign exchange had a nominal
impact on revenues. While we cannot predict with certainty future changes in
foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us, we attempt to
mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial
instruments. See the discussion under Note 6-D to our consolidated financial
statements,

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

, on pages
53 and 54 of our 2002 Annual Report. That discussion is incorporated by
reference. Related information about valuation and risks associated with such
financial instruments in parts E and F of that same Note is also incorporated
by reference.

Marketing

In our global pharmaceutical business, we promote our products to health
care providers such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants,
pharmacists, hospitals, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), Managed Care
Organizations (MCOs) and government agencies. We also market directly to
consumers in the United States through direct-to-consumer print and television
advertising. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public
about our innovative medical research.

Our operations include several pharmaceutical sales organizations. Each
sales organization markets a distinct group of products. Our prescription
pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell
directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies.

Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses and
advantages of our products to medical professionals. We work to gain access to
health authority, PBM and MCO formularies (lists of recommended or approved
medicines and other products) and reimbursement lists by demonstrating the
qualities and treatment benefits of our products. We also work with MCOs and
PBMs to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools
that help their medical treatment routines. For example, we sponsor a program
offered by the State of Florida Agency for Health Care Administration that is
designed to help manage chronic diseases among Florida’s Medicaid population.



Marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals depends to a degree on complex
decisions about the scope of clinical trials made years before product
approval. All drugs must complete clinical trials required by regulatory
authorities to show they are safe and effective for treating one or more
medical problems. A manufacturer may choose, however, to undertake additional
studies, including comparative clinical trials with competitive products, to
demonstrate additional advantages of a compound. Those studies can be costly
and take years to complete, and the results are uncertain. Balancing these
considerations makes it difficult to decide whether and when to undertake such
additional studies. But, when they are successful, such studies can have a
major impact on approved marketing claims and strategies.

Separate sales organizations are used by our Animal Health business to
promote its products. Its advertising and promotion are generally targeted to
health professionals, directly and through medical journals. Animal health and
nutrition products are sold through veterinarians, drug wholesalers,
distributors and retail outlets as well as directly to users. Where
appropriate, these products are also marketed through print and television
advertising.

Our CHC business primarily uses its own representatives to directly
promote its products. We also use print and television consumer advertising and
offer sales incentives such as coupons to promote our consumer products. These
products are sold through various retailers. CHC also markets and advertises
certain products directly to professionals using a professional detail force.

During 2002, sales to our three largest pharmaceutical and consumer
healthcare products wholesalers were as follows:

•

McKesson, Inc. — 16.8% of our revenues;

•

AmerisourceBergen Corporation — 14.8% of our revenues; and

•

Cardinal Health, Inc. — 13.4% of our revenues.

Sales to these wholesalers were concentrated in the Pharmaceutical
segment. Apart from these instances, neither of our business segments is dependent
on any one customer or group of related customers.

Patents and Intellectual Property Rights

Our products are sold around the world under brand-name, logo and certain
product design trademarks that we consider in the aggregate to be of material
importance. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the
mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered.
Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms.

We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents. These patents
cover

•

pharmaceutical and other products and their uses

•

pharmaceutical formulations

•

product manufacturing processes

•

intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing

Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to
the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various
countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded
by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the
country.

In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of material importance
to our businesses in the United States and most other countries. Based on
current product sales, and considering the vigorous competition with products
sold by others, the patent rights we consider significant in relation to our
business as a whole, together with the year in which the basic U.S. patent
expires (including, where applicable, the additional six-month pediatric
exclusivity period), are those for the following drugs:

Basic U.S. Patent

Drug

Expiration Year

Norvasc

Zyrtec

Aricept

Lipitor

Viagra

Viracept

Celebrex

Neurontin








see below

In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to these
products directed to particular forms or compositions of the drug or to methods
of manufacturing or using the drug in the treatment of further diseases or
conditions. Such patents may not protect the Company’s drug from generic drug
competition after the expiration of the basic patent.

Zithromax

is patented by Pliva, a Croatian pharmaceutical company. The
drug is licensed exclusively to us by Pliva for sales and marketing in major
countries, and we purchase the compound in bulk crude form from Pliva.

Celebrex

is patented by Pharmacia Corporation, with whom we copromote

Celebrex

in all world markets except Japan. An action against Pharmacia and the
Company alleging patent infringement with respect to the sale of

Celebrex

(as
well as

Bextra

) was dismissed on March 5, 2003. The plaintiff in that action
has appealed the decision.

Zyrtec

is patented by the Belgian company UCB S.A. and is licensed to us
for sales in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and South Africa. We copromote

Zyrtec

as a prescription medicine in the U.S. with a subsidiary of UCB S.A. and
have a license to sell

Zyrtec

as an OTC medicine in the other markets.

Aricept

is patented by Eisai Co., Ltd. We copromote

Aricept

with Eisai in
the U.S. and several other countries and have an exclusive license to sell the
drug in various other countries.

The basic U.S. patents relating to

Neurontin

expired in 1994 and 2000.
However, in April 2000, a U.S. patent was granted relating to stable
pharmaceutical compositions of

Neurontin

containing low levels of lactam
impurity. This patent expires in 2017. Other companies have filed applications
with the FDA seeking approval of products that we believe infringe this patent.

In addition, other companies have filed applications with the FDA seeking
approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering, among other
products,

Lipitor, Norvasc, Zoloft

,

Diflucan, Accupril

and

Procardia XL

. In the
case of

Zoloft

, while generic manufacturers are challenging certain of our
patents, the outcome of these challenges will not affect the timing of generic
competition with this product due to the existence of additional patents.

We have other patent rights covering additional products that have lesser
revenues.

The expiration of a product patent or loss of patent protection resulting
from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic
products against the covered product and, particularly in the U.S., can result
in a significant reduction in sales of the pioneer product. In some cases,
however, we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from

•     product manufacturing trade secrets

•     patents on uses for products

•     patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the
active ingredients

•     patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms

•     conversion of the active ingredient to OTC products

The effect of product patent expiration or loss also depends upon

•     the nature of the market and the position of the product in it

•     the growth of the market

•     the complexities and economics of manufacture of the product

•     the requirements of generic drug laws

One of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside
the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection of our
products. Under international agreements in recent years, global protection of
intellectual property rights is improving. The General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade requires participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws
to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by the end of a
ten-year transition period. A number



of countries are doing this. We have experienced significant growth in our
businesses in some of those nations, and our continued business expansion in
those countries depends to a large degree on further patent protection
improvement.

See Item 3,

Legal Proceedings

, below.

Competition

Competition is intense in all of our businesses and includes many large
and small competitors.

The principal means of competition vary among product categories and
business groups. Technological innovations affecting

•

efficacy

•

safety

•

patients’ ease of use

•

cost effectiveness

are important to success in all of our businesses.

Our businesses also focus on unmet medical needs and therapeutic
improvements. Our emphasis on innovation has led to our multi-billion-dollar
research and development investments over the past decade.

Our human pharmaceutical business competes with other worldwide
research-based drug companies, many smaller research companies with more
limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers. Our pharmaceutical
operations are the largest in the world.

In recent years, a comparison of the total cost of medical treatments
using pharmaceuticals versus alternative treatments for the same condition has
become an important basis of competition. MCOs and PBMs look to cost advantages
as well as medical benefits in making their drug formulary decisions.

Our pharmaceutical sales and marketing organization is a valuable
competitive asset. Our salespeople’s ability to reach medical professionals
with information about our products helps us respond to competitive efforts and
launch new products.

We have a significant presence in the animal health marketplace, but many
other companies offer competitive products. Altogether, there are hundreds of
producers of animal health products throughout the world. The principal methods
of competition vary somewhat depending on the particular product. They include

We promote our products directly through our sales representatives as well as
through advertising.

Many other companies, large and small, manufacture and sell one or more
products that are similar to our consumer healthcare products. Sources of
competitive advantage include

Significant expenditures for advertising, promotion and marketing are generally
required to achieve both consumer and trade acceptance of consumer products.

In the current environment of competitive pressures on profit margins, we
continue efforts to control the growth of our expenses. We have kept our costs
down in areas such as manufacturing, distribution and sales administration by
restructuring and consolidating facilities. These measures have brought us new
efficiencies and reduced or contained our operating expenses.

Managed Care Organizations

The growth of MCOs in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitive
make-up of the health care marketplace. Over half the U.S. population now
participates in some version of managed care. Because of the size of the
patient population covered by MCOs, marketing of prescription drugs to them and
the PBMs that serve many of those organizations has become important to our
business.

MCOs can include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators,
health-



maintenance organizations, alliances of hospitals and physicians and other
physician organizations. The purchasing power of MCOs has been increasing in
recent years due to their growing numbers of enrolled patients. At the same
time, those organizations have been consolidating into fewer, even larger
entities. This enhances their purchasing strength and importance to us.

A major objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce health
care expenditures. They typically use formularies, volume purchases and
long-term contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical providers. They
use their purchasing power to bargain for lower supplier prices. They also
emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures
performed at doctors’ offices and clinics. Hospitalization and surgery,
typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed.

As discussed above in

Marketing

, MCOs and PBMs typically develop
formularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies can be based on
the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products. Due to their
generally lower cost, generic medicines are often favored. The breadth of the
products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another,
and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment
of particular medical problems. MCOs use a variety of means to encourage
patients’ use of products listed on their formularies.

Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced
usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies
compete aggressively to have their products included. Where possible, companies
compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products, such as
greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower
overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate
fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on
price.

The growth of MCOs also appears to have led to greater usage of some
drugs. The use of certain drugs can prevent the need for more costly treatments
such as hospitalization, professional therapy or even surgery. Because of these
advantages, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments. In addition,
the current trend of some patients to opt for managed care alternatives to
Medicare may increase overall pharmaceutical usage among that segment of the
elderly population. Medicare generally does not pay for outpatient use of
medicines, so patients who do not have another source of prescription drug
coverage must bear that cost. MCOs, however, often offer drug benefits for
their participants.

These developments not only have created pressure on prices, but also have
increased sales of products on formularies. We have been generally, although
not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO
formularies.

Another way we address the interests of MCOs is by developing
disease-management programs. These programs can be attractive to MCOs by
improving patient communications and compliance with dosage directions, which
are important for effective disease treatment. They can help MCOs address
various aspects of disease management, such as prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of certain diseases, including use of pharmaceutical products. This
comprehensive approach can improve the quality of care and lower costly
complications of chronic diseases. As noted above in

Marketing

, one such
program, which is sponsored by us and offered by the State of Florida Agency
for Health Care Administration, is designed to help manage chronic diseases
among Florida’s Medicaid population.

Generic Products

One of the biggest competitive challenges that we face in the U.S. and
that is growing internationally is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Upon the expiration or loss of U.S. patent protection on a product, we can lose
the major portion of U.S. sales of that product in a very short period. Generic
competitors operate without our large research and development expenses and our
costs of conveying medical information about the product to the medical
community. In addition, the FDA approval process exempts generics from costly
and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy,
and allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the
pioneer product. Generic products need only demonstrate a level of



availability in the bloodstream equivalent to that of the pioneer product.
This means that after we have borne the expenses of discovering, developing and
testing a medicine for safety and efficacy, obtaining regulatory approval and
informing the medical community about its therapeutic benefits, generic
competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration
of our patent, charge much less and still be profitable.

As noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs
often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the
use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their health care
programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and
in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been
rated under government procedures to be therapeutically equivalent to a
brand-name drug. The substitution must be made unless the prescribing physician
expressly forbids it.

Raw Materials

Raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the
ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these
materials are available from multiple sources. No serious shortages or delays
were encountered in 2002, and none are expected in 2003.

Government Regulation and Price Constraints

Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by numerous
national, state and local agencies. Of particular importance is the FDA in the
United States. It has jurisdiction over virtually all of our businesses and
administers requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness,
manufacturing, labeling, marketing, advertising and post-marketing surveillance
of our pharmaceutical products. FDA requirements and/or reviews have increased
the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products and bring them
to market.

The FDA also regulates most of our consumer healthcare products and, along
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, our animal health products.

Since
1998, the approval of new drugs across the European Union (EU) is possible only using
the European Medicines Evaluation Agency’s (EMEA) mutual recognition or central
approval processes. The use of either of these procedures provides a more rapid
and consistent approval within the 15 member states than was the case when the
approval processes were operating independently within each member state.
Further, on January 1, 2000, Norway and Iceland became full participants in the
EU central approval processes. In addition, the agreement between the EU and 12
other European states to base their approvals on the centralized EU approval
will significantly speed the regulatory process in those countries. The EMEA
does not have jurisdiction over patient reimbursement or pricing matters in EU
member countries, however. We continue to deal with individual countries on
such issues.

In recent years in the U.S., various legislative proposals have been
offered at the federal and state levels that would bring about major changes in
the affected health care systems. Some states have passed such legislation, and
further federal and state proposals are possible. Such proposals and
legislation include, and future proposals could include, price controls or
patient access constraints on medicines and increases in required rebates or
discounts. Similar issues exist
in many foreign countries where we do business. We cannot predict the outcome
of such initiatives, but we will work to maintain patient access to our
products and to oppose price constraints.

In the U.S., federal proposals have called for substantial changes in the
Medicare program, and federal and state proposals have called for substantial
changes in the Medicaid program. Driven by budget concerns, Medicaid access and
reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in
many others. If the Medicare and Medicaid programs implement changes that
restrict the access of a significant population of patients to our innovative
medicines, our business could be materially affected. On the other hand,
relatively little pharmaceutical use is currently covered by Medicare. If
changes to Medicare shift patients to MCOs that cover



pharmaceuticals, or if an outpatient drug benefit is added to Medicare,
usage of pharmaceuticals could increase. Pricing pressures likely would ensue
in either case given the enhancement of the purchasing power of the MCOs or the
federal government.

Medicare currently does not generally provide outpatient prescription drug
coverage. In this context, in order to help address the issue of affordable
access to health care for those most in need, we instituted the Pfizer for
Living Share Card program in 2002. Through this program, low-income Medicare
recipients without prescription drug coverage can purchase 30-day prescriptions
of any Pfizer prescription medicine and of the copromoted product

Aricept

at many retail pharmacies for $15.

U.S. law requires us to give rebates to state Medicaid agencies based on
each state’s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the Medicaid
program. Some states are seeking rebates in excess of the amounts required by
federal law, and there are federal legislative proposals to expand current
Medicaid rebates. We also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or
reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state
agencies and programs. In 2000 and 2001, the states of Vermont and Maine
received approval of waivers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services that would expand Medicaid rebates beyond the current Medicaid
population. Both of these waivers were struck down by federal appeals courts.
Separately, in 2000 the state of Maine passed legislation requiring
pharmaceutical companies to provide the same price discounts to residents of
the state, regardless of their income, who are not eligible for Medicaid as are
provided to Medicaid participants. If a pharmaceutical company declines to
provide such discounts to the non-Medicaid population, in most cases doctors
will not be allowed to prescribe that company’s drugs to Medicaid patients
without obtaining prior authorization from the state. The Maine program was
upheld by a federal appeals court in 2001. That decision has been appealed to
the U.S. Supreme Court, and a decision is expected later this year. If the
Maine program is upheld on appeal, other states may adopt similar legislation
that would extend Medicaid-level discounts beyond the current Medicaid
population.

Rebates potentially could be viewed as price discounts without
appreciable increases in volume as an offset. See the discussion regarding
rebates on page 32 of our 2002 Annual Report, which discussion is incorporated
by reference.

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other
countries. In Europe and some other international markets, the government
provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates
pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the
government-sponsored health care system. This international patchwork of price
regulation has led to different prices and some third-party trade in our
products from markets with lower prices. Such trade exploiting price
differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher
prices.

In October 2002, the Bush Administration announced a regulatory initiative
relating to patent litigation pursuant to the 1984 Drug Price Competition and
Patent Term Restoration Act, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Under the
Hatch-Waxman Act, if a generic drug company files an abbreviated new drug
application (ANDA) with the FDA and a research-based drug company promptly
files a lawsuit alleging that the generic product would infringe one or more of
its patents, approval of the ANDA by the FDA automatically is stayed for a
period of up to 30 months. The proposed regulation would permit only one such
30-month stay period to be triggered by a patent-infringement suit between a
research-based firm and an ANDA applicant. The proposed regulation also would
clarify the type of patents eligible for listing in the FDA’s “Orange Book”. A
final FDA regulation is anticipated this year. It also is possible that
legislation amending the Hatch-Waxman Act could be enacted this year. One
possible amendment would codify the Bush Administration’s regulatory initiative
and also require that settlements in patent-challenge cases between
research-based drug companies and generic drug companies be reported to the
Federal Trade Commission. Other proposals that would be detrimental to the
innovative pharmaceutical industry already have been introduced and could be
enacted.

In addition to the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S.
Environmental



Protection Agency, we are subject to the jurisdiction of various other
regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies, such as the Department of
Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of
Justice in the U.S. We are, therefore, subject to possible administrative and
legal proceedings and actions by those regulatory bodies (see Item 3,

Legal
Proceedings

, below). Such actions may include product recalls, seizures and
other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, we have initiated product
recalls voluntarily.

It is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding
legislative and regulatory requirements affecting us.

Environmental Law Compliance

Most of our manufacturing and certain research operations are affected by
federal, state and local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to
continue to make, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws.
We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial
activity at certain sites (see Item 3,

Legal Proceedings

, below). As a result,
we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2002 for environmental
protection and clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows:

•

environment-related capital expenditures — $47 million ($2 million of which
related to discontinued operations)

•

other environment-related expenses — $146 million ($3 million of which
related to discontinued operations)

While we cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such clean-up
activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental
compliance, we do not believe they will have a material effect on our capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Banking and Insurance Subsidiaries

We conduct international banking operations through a subsidiary, Pfizer
International Bank Europe (PIBE), based in Dublin, Ireland. PIBE, incorporated
under the laws of Ireland, operates under a banking license from the Central
Bank of Ireland. It makes loans and accepts deposits in several currencies in
international markets. PIBE is an active Euromarket lender to financially
strong borrowers through its portfolio of loans and money market instruments.
Loans are made primarily on a short- and medium-term basis, typically with
floating interest rates.

We also own an insurance operation, The Kodiak Company Limited, which
reinsures certain assets, inland transport and marine cargo of our
international operations.

Financial data for these subsidiaries are set forth in Note 5 to our
consolidated financial statements,

Banking and Insurance Subsidiaries

, on page
51 of our 2002 Annual Report, and information relating to our banking
operations is set forth under the heading

Banking Operation

on pages 38 and 39
of our 2002 Annual Report. Such data and information are incorporated by
reference.

Tax Matters

The discussion of tax-related matters in Note 11 to our consolidated
financial statements,

Taxes on Income

, on pages 56 and 57 of our 2002 Annual
Report is incorporated by reference.

Employees

In our innovation-intensive business, our employees are vital to our
success. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. As of
December 31, 2002, we employed approximately 98,000 people in our operations
throughout the world.

Proposed Acquisition of Pharmacia Corporation

In July 2002, we entered into an agreement to acquire Pharmacia
Corporation (Pharmacia), a global pharmaceutical company. Pharmacia’s human
pharmaceuticals include primary care products (including

Celebrex

and

Bextra

,
which we copromote with Pharmacia, and

Detrol

)

,

opthalmology care products
(including

Xalatan

), cancer care products (including

Camptosar)

, endocrine
care products (including

Genotropin

) and hospital care products. Pharmacia also



operates several other businesses, including animal health and consumer
healthcare businesses.

In December 2002, shareholders of both Pfizer and Pharmacia approved the
proposed acquisition. In February 2003, the European Commission approved the
transaction. On March 17, 2003, we and Pharmacia announced that the companies
have reached agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on
the divestitures that will be required in connection with the proposed
acquisition and that the companies have agreements in place with buyers for all
of the assets to be divested. The products and compounds to be divested are not
material, either individually or in the aggregate, to Pfizer’s business or
operations. On March 25, 2003, the companies announced that the
FTC staff has completed its review and that a proposed Consent Decree
will be forwarded to
the FTC for acceptance and placement on the public record. Based on past FTC
practice, Pfizer anticipates that this process will result in the closing of
the transaction in April 2003.

The proposed acquisition is a stock-for-stock transaction valued as of the
merger agreement date at approximately $60 billion. Upon the closing, we will
issue approximately two billion shares of Pfizer common stock in exchange for
all of the outstanding common stock of Pharmacia. In addition, we will exchange
a newly created class of Pfizer convertible perpetual preferred stock
(convertible into approximately 16 million shares of Pfizer common stock) for a
substantially identical class of Pharmacia stock, and we will exchange options
on 1.4 shares of Pfizer common stock for each outstanding Pharmacia option.

Proposed Acquisition of Pharmacia
Corporation

Activities

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results

(Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995)

Our disclosure and analysis in this report and in our 2002 Annual Report
to Shareholders contain some forward-looking statements that set forth
anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. From time to
time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release
to the public as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give
our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. We have tried, wherever possible, to
identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,”
“expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will” and similar
expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial
performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future
actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or
results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal
proceedings, and financial results.

We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized,
although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions.
Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and
potentially inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate,
actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated,
estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider
forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are
advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related
subjects in our 10-Q and 8-K reports to the SEC. Also note that we provide the
following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate
assumptions relevant to our businesses. These are factors that, individually or
in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially
from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as
permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should
understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion
of all potential risks or uncertainties.



•     Balancing current growth and investment for the future remains a major
challenge. Our ongoing investments in new product introductions and research
and development for future products could exceed corresponding sales growth.
This could produce higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues.

•     In the U.S., many pharmaceutical products are subject to increasing pricing
pressures, which could be significantly impacted by the outcome of the current
national debate over Medicare reform. If the Medicare program provided
outpatient pharmaceutical coverage for its beneficiaries, the federal
government, through its enormous purchasing power under the program, could
demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies that may implicitly create price
controls on prescription drugs. On the other hand, a Medicare drug
reimbursement provision may increase the volume of pharmaceutical drug
purchases, offsetting at least in part these potential price discounts. In
addition, MCOs, Medicaid and other government agencies continue to seek price
discounts. Government efforts to reduce Medicare and Medicaid expenses may
continue to increase the use of MCOs. This may result in managed care’s
influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population. In
addition, certain states have proposed and certain other states have adopted
various programs to control prices for their seniors’ drug programs, including
price or patient reimbursement constraints, restrictions on access to certain
products, importation from other countries and bulk purchasing of drugs.

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other
countries. In Europe and some other international markets, the government
provides health care at low direct cost to consumers and regulates
pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the
government-sponsored health care system. This international patchwork of price
regulation has led to different prices and some third-party trade in our
products from markets with lower prices. Such trade exploiting price
differences between countries can undermine our sales in markets with higher
prices.

As a result, it is expected that pressures on the pricing component of
operating results will continue.

•     35.9% of our 2002 revenues arose from international operations, including
6.1% from Japan. These international-based revenues as well as our substantial
international assets expose our revenues and earnings to foreign currency
exchange rate changes. In addition, our interest-bearing investments, loans and
borrowings are subject to interest rate change risk. The risks of such changes
and the measures we have taken to help contain those risks are discussed in the
section entitled

Financial Risk Management

on pages 40 and 41 of our 2002
Annual Report. For additional details, see Note 6-D to our consolidated
financial statements,

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
on pages 53 and 54 of our 2002 Annual Report. Those sections of our 2002 Annual
Report are incorporated by reference.

Notwithstanding our efforts to foresee and mitigate the effects of changes
in fiscal circumstances, we cannot predict with certainty changes in currency
and interest rates, inflation or other related factors affecting our
businesses.

•     Our international operations also could be affected by changes in
intellectual property legal protections and remedies, trade regulations and
procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement
and marketing of products, as well as by unstable governments and legal
systems, intergovernmental disputes and possible nationalization.

•     Competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge in the
U.S. and is growing internationally. Expiration or loss of patent protection
typically leads to significant loss of sales in the U.S. market. The patents
covering several of the Company’s medicines are being challenged by generic
drug manufacturers.

•     Risks and uncertainties particularly apply with respect to product-related
forward-looking
statements. The outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new
compounds and developing new products is inherently



uncertain. There can be no
assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new
products or for new indications or dosage forms for existing products. There
are also many considerations that can affect marketing of pharmaceutical
products around the world. Regulatory delays, the inability to successfully
complete clinical trials, claims and concerns about safety and efficacy, new
discoveries, patent disputes and claims about adverse side effects are a few of
the factors that could adversely affect the realization of research and
development and product-related forward-looking statements.

•     As discussed above in

Marketing,

decisions about research studies made early
in the development process of a drug candidate can have a substantial impact on
the marketing strategy once the drug receives approval. More detailed studies
may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they
consume time and resources and can delay submitting the drug candidate for
initial approval. We try to plan clinical trials prudently, but there is no
guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case.
The quality of our decisions in this area could affect our future results.

•     Difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing, including, but
not limited to, the inability to build up production capacity commensurate with
demand, or the failure to predict market demand for, or to gain market
acceptance of, approved products, could affect future results.

•     We currently market ten products with annual sales to third parties exceeding
$1 billion each:

Lipitor, Norvasc, Zoloft, Neurontin, Viagra, Zithromax,
Zyrtec, Diflucan

and our copromoted products

Celebrex

and

Aricept.

Those
products accounted for almost three-quarters of our 2002 revenues. If these or
any of our other major products were to become subject to a problem such as
loss of patent protection, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings,
publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence or pressure from competitive
products, or if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the
impact on our revenues could be significant. The patents covering

Lipitor,
Norvasc, Neurontin, Diflucan and Zoloft

are the subject of pending
legal challenges. An action alleging patent infringement with respect
to the sale of

Celebrex

(as well as

Bextra

) was dismissed on
March 5, 2003; the plaintiff in that action has appealed the
decision.

•     We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of
competitive products or their possible future effect on our sales. Products
that compete with our drugs, including some of our best-selling medicines, are
launched from time to time, and certain potentially competitive products are in
various stages of development, some of which have been filed for approval with
the FDA.

•     Growth in costs and expenses, changes in product mix and the impact of
acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, product withdrawals and other
unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies, evaluation
of asset realization and organizational restructuring could affect future
results. Such risks and uncertainties include, in particular, our ability to
obtain the anticipated results and synergies from our proposed acquisition of
Pharmacia and the increased uncertainty created by the integration of the two
businesses as well as our ability to divest and the timing of the divestitures
of our remaining discontinued businesses and product lines.

•     Our future results could be affected by changes in laws and regulations,
including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including
tax-rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations),
competition laws and environmental laws in the U.S. and other countries.

•     Our future results could be affected by changes in business, political and
economic conditions, including the cost and availability of insurance, due to
the threat of future terrorist activity in the U.S. and other parts of the
world and related U.S. military action overseas.

•     We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent, product
liability, consumer, commercial, environmental, and tax litigations and claims;
government investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to
time in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe any of them will
have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Litigation is
inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we believe
we have valid defenses in these matters, we could in the future
incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.



Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and/or validity of our
patents on various products or processes. Although we believe that we have
valid defenses to these challenges with respect to all our material patents,
there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters, and a loss in any
of these cases could result in a loss of patent protection for the drug at
issue, which could lead to a significant loss of sales of that drug and could
materially affect future results of operations.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our corporate headquarters and the headquarters of our human
pharmaceutical and animal health businesses are located at our world
headquarters, which includes several buildings in New York City. We own two of
the buildings, including our main, 33-story office tower at 235 East

nd

Street, and lease other nearby space. Our 33-story office tower is located on a
site we lease under a long-term ground lease.

For our pharmaceutical businesses, we own and lease space around the world
for sales and marketing, administrative support and customer service functions.

Our Global Research and Development division is headquartered in New
London, Connecticut and has major operations in owned facilities in Amboise,
France; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Freiburg, Germany; Fresnes, France; Groton,
Connecticut; Holland, Michigan; Nagoya, Japan; Sandwich, England, U.K.; and
Terre Haute, Indiana. We also lease major facilities in La Jolla, California
and Cambridge, Massachusetts for pharmaceutical research and development
operations.

Our Global Manufacturing division operates plants in 54 locations around
the world that manufacture products for our human pharmaceutical, animal health
and consumer healthcare businesses. Major facilities are located in Brazil,
China, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Singapore,
the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition, the Global Manufacturing
division operates numerous distribution facilities in major markets around the
world.

The headquarters and research operations of our Consumer Healthcare
business are located in Morris Plains, New Jersey, where we own five buildings
and lease a smaller amount of space nearby. CHC’s sales and marketing offices
are located in leased space, in many cases shared with other businesses.

The Capsugel business operates manufacturing and distribution facilities
in ten locations around the world.

The Adams Confectionery business, which we recently agreed to sell,
operates manufacturing facilities in 24 locations around the world.

The Schick-Wilkinson Sword Shaving Products business, which we also
recently agreed to sell, operates manufacturing facilities in five locations
around the world.

In general, our properties are well maintained, adequate and suitable to
their purposes. The growth of our businesses has created space pressures for
certain operations, however. We have responded to such challenges with plans
to provide appropriate facilities as needs are demonstrated. Note 8 to our
consolidated financial statements,

our 2002 Annual Report, which discloses amounts invested in land, buildings and
equipment, and the discussion of investing activities under the heading

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A discussion of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, both in
general and with respect to specific matters and types of matters, is set forth
in Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements,

Legal Proceedings and
Contingencies,

on pages 62-64 of our 2002 Annual Report. That discussion is
incorporated by reference. The following is limited to a description of certain
recent developments and should be read in conjunction with the discussion
in Note 20. Unless otherwise indicated, all proceedings discussed in Note 20
remain pending.



Patent Matters

Neurontin (gabapentin)

As previously reported, in 2000, Warner-Lambert brought patent
infringement suits against several generic manufacturers that have filed
abbreviated new drug applications with the FDA asserting the invalidity and
non-infringement of our gabapentin (

Neurontin)

low-lactam patent. One of those
generic manufacturers recently received tentative approval from the FDA to
market a generic version of gabapentin

.

Tentative approval means that this
generic manufacturer can market its product after the expiration of the 180-day
marketing exclusivity period in favor of one of the other generic manufacturers
that has not yet received FDA approval to market its generic version of
gabapentin.

Lipitor (atorvastatin)

In February 2003, we filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware for infringement of our basic product patent for
atorvastatin (

Lipitor

) against a generic manufacturer that has filed an
abbreviated new drug application with the FDA and asserted that its product
would not infringe the patent. Our basic product patent, including the
additional six-month pediatric exclusivity period, expires in 2010.
Subsequently, the generic manufacturer asserted that our patent covering the
active enantiomeric form of the drug is invalid; that patent, including the
six-month pediatric exclusivity period, expires in 2011.

Celebrex, Bextra (celecoxib, valdecoxib)

In the previously reported patent infringement action brought by the
University of Rochester against Pfizer and others with respect to

Celebrex

and

Bextra,

the University recently appealed the court’s decision granting our
motions for summary judgment.

Other Matters

Neurontin

As previously reported, the U.S. Attorney’s office in Boston,
Massachusetts has been conducting an investigation into Warner-Lambert’s
promotion of

Neurontin

. These allegations are now also the subject of a number
of suits, including purported class actions, filed in various federal and state
courts.

part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there

CERTIFICATIONS PURSUANT
TO

SECTION 302 OF

THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

CERTIFICATION BY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

I, Henry A. McKinnell, certify that:

1.

I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Pfizer Inc.;

2.

Based on my knowledge, this annual report does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
covered by this annual report;

3.

Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in this annual report, fairly present in all
material respects the financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
this annual report;


4.

The registrant’s other certifying officers and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14) for the registrant and
have:

a)

designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
material information relating to the registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
entities, particularly during the period in which this annual report
is being prepared;

b)

evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure
controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the
filing date of this annual report (the “Evaluation Date”); and

c)

presented in this annual report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based on our
evaluation as of the Evaluation Date;

5.

The registrant’s other certifying officers and I have disclosed,
based on our most recent evaluation, to the registrant’s auditors and
the audit committee of registrant’s board of directors (or persons
performing the equivalent functions):

a)

all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
