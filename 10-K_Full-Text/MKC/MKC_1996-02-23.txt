Registrant's Proxy Statement dated 2/20/96     Part III, Part IV

                                PART I  

As used herein, the "Registrant" means McCormick & Company, Incorporated
and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.

Item 1. Business    

The Registrant, a diversified specialty food company, is principally
engaged in the manufacture of spices, seasonings, flavorings and other
specialty food products and sells such products to the retail food
market, the foodservice market and to industrial food processors
throughout the world.  The Registrant also, through subsidiary
corporations, manufactures and markets plastic packaging products for
the food, cosmetic and health care industries.    

The Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1995, which is
enclosed as Exhibit 13, contains a description of the general
development, during the last fiscal year, of the business of
the Registrant, which was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the
successor to a business established in 1889.  Pages 9 through 12 and 30
through 36 of that Report are incorporated by reference.  The
Registrant's net sales increased 10% in 1995 to $1,858,694,000 due to
both sales price and volume changes.    

The Registrant operates in one business segment and has disclosed in
Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 28 of
its Annual Report to Stockholders for 1995, which Note is incorporated
by reference, the financial information about the business segment
required by this Item.   

The Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1995 sets forth a
description of the business conducted by the Registrant on pages 9
through 12.  Those pages of the Registrant's Annual Report are
incorporated by reference.

Principal Products/Marketing  

Spices, seasonings, flavorings, and other specialty food products are
the Registrant's principal products.  Spices, seasonings, flavorings,
and other specialty food products accounted for approximately 90% of net
sales on a consolidated basis during the three fiscal years ended
November 30, 1995.  No other product or class of similar products or
services contributed as much as 10% to consolidated net sales during the
last three fiscal years.  The Registrant's efforts will continue to be
directed primarily in the area of spices, seasonings, flavorings, and
other specialty food products.          

The Registrant markets its consumer and foodservice products through its
own sales organization, food brokers and distributors. In the industrial
market, sales are made mostly through the Registrant's own sales force.

Products/Industry Segments    

The Registrant has not announced or made public information about a new
product or industry segment that would require the investment of a
material amount of the assets of the Registrant or that otherwise is
material.

Raw Materials  

Many of the spices and herbs purchased by the Registrant are imported
into the United States from the country of origin, although substantial
quantities of particular materials, such as paprika, dehydrated
vegetables, onion and garlic, and substantially all of the specialty
food ingredients other than spices and herbs, originate in the United
States. Some of the imported materials are purchased from dealers in the
United States.  The Registrant is a direct importer of certain raw
materials, mainly black pepper, vanilla beans, cinnamon, herbs and seeds
from the countries of origin.  The principal purpose of such purchases
is to satisfy the Registrant's own needs.  The Registrant also sells
imported raw materials to other food processors.       

The raw materials most important to the Registrant are onion, garlic and
capsicums (paprika and chili peppers), which are produced in the United
States, black pepper, most of which originates in India, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Brazil, and vanilla beans, a large proportion of which the
Registrant obtains from the Malagasy Republic and Indonesia.  The
Registrant does not anticipate any material restrictions or shortages on
the availability of raw materials which would have a significant impact
on the Registrant's business in the foreseeable future.

Trademarks, Licenses and Patents   

The Registrant owns a number of registered trademarks, which in the
aggregate may be material to the Registrant's business. However, the
loss of any one of those trademarks, with the exception of the
Registrant's "McCormick" and "Schilling" trademarks, would not have a
material adverse impact on the Registrant's business.  The "McCormick"
and "Schilling" trademarks are extensively used by the Registrant in
connection with the sale of a substantial number of the Registrant's
products in the United States.  The "McCormick" and "Schilling"
trademarks are registered and used in various foreign countries as well.

The terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law and
the registrations will be renewed for as long as the Registrant deems
them to be useful.  

The Registrant has entered into a number of license agreements
authorizing the use of its trademarks by persons in foreign countries. 
In the aggregate, the loss of those license agreements would not have a
material adverse impact on the Registrant's business.  The terms of the
license agreements are generally 3 to 5 years or until such time as
either party terminates the agreement.  Those agreements with specific
terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties.     

The Registrant owns various patents, but they are not viewed as material
to the Registrant's business.

Seasonal Nature of Business   

Historically, the Registrant's sales and profits are lower in the first
two quarters of the fiscal year and increase in the third and fourth
quarters.  

Working Capital     

In order to meet increased demand for its products during its fourth
quarter, the Registrant usually builds its inventories during the second
and third quarters.  In common with other companies, the Registrant
generally finances working capital items (inventory and receivables)
through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit
and the issuance of commercial paper.  The Registrant's Annual Report to
Stockholders for 1995 sets forth a description of the Registrant's
liquidity and capital resources on pages 33 through 35, which pages are
incorporated by reference.

Customers 

The Registrant has a large number of customers for its products.  No
single customer accounted for as much as 10% of consolidated net sales
in 1995.  In the same year, sales to the five largest customers
represented approximately 20% of consolidated net sales.

Backlog Orders 

The dollar amount of backlog orders of the Registrant's business is not
material to an understanding of the Registrant's business, taken as a
whole.

Government Contracts     

No material portion of the Registrant's business is subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at
the election of the government.

Competition    

Although the Registrant is a leader in sales of certain spices and
seasoning and flavoring products, and is the largest producer and
distributor of dehydrated onions and garlic in the United States, its
business is highly competitive. For further discussion, see pages 10 and
30 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1995, which
pages are incorporated by reference.

Research and Quality Control  

The Registrant has emphasized quality and innovation in the development,
production and packaging of its products.  Many of the Registrant's
products are prepared from confidential formulae developed by its
research laboratories and product development departments.  The long
experience of the Registrant in its field contributes substantially to
the quality of the products offered for sale.  Quality specifications
exist for the Registrant's products, and continuing quality control
inspections and testing are performed.  Total expenditures for these and
other related activities during fiscal years 1995, 1994 and 1993 were
approximately $39,473,000, $39,562,000 and $38,226,000 respectively.  Of
these amounts, expenditures for research and development amounted to
$13,937,000 in 1995, $12,999,000 in 1994 and $12,259,000 in 1993.  The
amount spent on customer-sponsored research activities is not material.

Environmental Regulations     

Compliance with Federal, State and local provisions related to
protection of the environment has had no material effect on the
Registrant's business.  No material capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities are expected to be made during this
fiscal year or the next.

Employees The Registrant had on average approximately 8,900 employees
during fiscal year 1995. 

Foreign Operations  

International businesses have made significant contributions to the
Registrant's growth and profits.  In common with other companies with
foreign operations, the Registrant is subject in varying degrees to
certain risks typically associated with doing business abroad, such as
local economic and market conditions, exchange and price controls,
restrictions on investment, royalties and dividends and exchange rate
fluctuations.  

Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 28 of
the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1995, and page 31 of
the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1995 contain the
information required by subsection (d) of Item 101 of Regulation S-K,
which pages are incorporated by reference.

Packaging Operations     

The Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1995 sets forth a
description of the Registrant's packaging group on page 9, which page is
incorporated by reference.  Setco, Inc. and Tubed Products, Inc., which
comprise Registrant's packaging group, are wholly owned subsidiaries of
the Registrant and are, respectively, manufacturers of plastic bottles
and plastic squeeze tubes.    

Substantially all of the raw materials used in the packaging business
originate in the United States.  The market for plastic packaging is
highly competitive.  The Registrant is the largest single customer of
the packaging group. All intracompany sales have been eliminated from
the Registrant's consolidated financial statements.
