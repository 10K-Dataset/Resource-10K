Registrant's 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders

Part I, Part II, Part IV

Registrant's Proxy Statement dated February 15, 2002

Part III

PART I

As used herein, the "Registrant" means McCormick & Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.

Item 1. Business

The Registrant, a diversified specialty food company, is a global leader in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of spices, herbs, seasonings, flavorings
and other specialty food products to the entire food industry. The Registrant also, through subsidiary corporations, manufactures and markets specialty plastic bottles and tubes for food, personal
care and other industries. The Registrant was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889.

The
Registrant operates in three business segments: consumer; industrial; and packaging. The consumer segment sells spices, herbs, extracts, proprietary seasoning blends, sauces and
marinades to the consumer food market under a variety of brands, including the "McCormick" brand, and the "Club House" brand in Canada, the "Schwartz" brand in the U.K. and the "Ducros" brand in
Europe. The industrial segment sells spices, herbs, extracts, proprietary seasonings, condiments, coatings and compound flavors to food processors, restaurant chains, distributors, warehouse clubs and
institutional operations. The packaging segment sells plastic packaging products to the food, personal care and other industries, primarily in the U.S. See Note 13 "Business Segments and
Geographic Areas" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 44 and 45 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2001, which pages are incorporated by reference. Additional
financial information about the Registrant's business segments is incorporated by reference from "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on pages 22 through 30 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for
2001, which pages are incorporated by reference.

The
Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2001, which is enclosed as Exhibit 13, contains a description of the business on pages 11 through 19, which pages are
incorporated by reference. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to amounts in this Report or in the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2001 are amounts from continuing operations.

Raw Materials

Many of the spices and herbs purchased by the Registrant are imported into the U.S. from the country of origin, although significant quantities of some materials,
such as paprika, dehydrated vegetables, onion and garlic, and food ingredients other than spices and herbs, originate in the U.S. The Registrant is a direct importer of certain raw materials, mainly
black pepper, vanilla beans, cinnamon, herbs and seeds from their countries of origin. In addition, the Registrant also purchases cheese and dairy powders from U.S. sources for use in many industrial
products.

The
raw materials most important to the Registrant are cheese and dairy powders, black pepper, onion, garlic, capsicums (paprika and chili peppers) and vanilla beans. The Registrant is
not aware of any restrictions or other factors that would have a material adverse effect on the availability of these raw materials. Because the raw materials are agricultural products, the Registrant
uses a combination of open market purchases and advance purchase commitments, most of which are short-term in nature, to minimize volatility in price and uncertainty of supply.

Substantially
all of the raw materials used in the packaging segment originate in the U.S.

Customers

The Registrant's products are sold through its own sales organization, brokers and distributors. In the consumer segment, these products are generally resold to
consumers through grocery, mass merchandise, drug and other retail outlets. In the industrial segment, these products are used by food


and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by foodservice customers to enhance the flavor of their foods. In the packaging segment, plastic bottles and tubes are sold to
pharmaceutical, cosmetics and other companies in the personal care industry as well as to the food industry.

The
Registrant has a large number of customers for its products. No single customer accounted for as much as 10% of consolidated net sales in 2001. Sales to the Registrant's five largest
customers represented approximately 24% of consolidated net sales.

The
dollar amount of backlog orders of the Registrant's business is not material to an understanding of the Registrant's business, taken as a whole. No material portion of the
Registrant's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the Government.

Trademarks, Licenses and Patents

The Registrant owns a number of trademark registrations. Although in the aggregate these trademarks may be material to the Registrant's business, the loss of any
one of those trademarks, with the exception of the Registrant's "McCormick," "Schwartz," "Club House" and "Ducros" trademarks, would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrant's business.
The "McCormick" trademark is extensively used by the Registrant in connection with the sale of virtually all of the Registrant's food products worldwide, with the exception of Canada, Europe and the
U.K. The terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be renewed for as long as the Registrant deems them to be useful.

The
Registrant has entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of its trademarks by affiliated and non-affiliated entities. In the aggregate, the loss of
license agreements with non-affiliated entities would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrant's business. The term of the license agreements is generally 3 to 5 years
or until such time as either party terminates the agreement. Those agreements with specific terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties.

The
Registrant owns various patents, but they are not viewed as material to the Registrant's business.

Seasonal Nature of Business

Due to seasonal factors inherent in the business, the Registrant's sales and income are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year and increase in the
third and fourth quarters. The seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the consumer segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand for its products during its fourth quarter, the Registrant usually builds its inventories during the third quarter. The
Registrant generally finances working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial
paper. For a description of the Registrant's liquidity and capital resources, see Note 5 "Financing Arrangements" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 39 and 40 of the
Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2001, which page is incorporated by reference, and the "Financial Condition" section of "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on pages 26 and 27 of the
Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2001, which pages are incorporated by reference.


Competition

The Registrant is a global leader in the manufacture and sale of spices, herbs, extracts, seasonings and flavorings and competes in a geographic market that is
international and highly competitive. For further discussion, see pages 11 through 19 in the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2001, which pages are incorporated by reference.

Research and Quality Control

The Registrant has emphasized quality and innovation in the development, production and packaging of its products. Many of the Registrant's products are prepared
from confidential formulae developed by its research laboratories and product development departments. The long experience of the Registrant in its field contributes substantially to the quality of
the products offered for sale. Quality specifications exist for the Registrant's products, and continuing quality control inspections and testing are performed. Total expenditures for these and other
related activities during fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 were approximately $53 million, $48.4 million and $42.8 million, respectively. Of these amounts, expenditures for
research and development amounted to $27.1million in 2001, $24.9 million in 2000 and $21.4 million in 1999. The amount spent on customer-sponsored research activities is not material.

Environmental Regulations

Compliance with Federal, State and local provisions related to protection of the environment has had no material effect on the Registrant's business. There were
no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2001 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2002.

Employees

The Registrant had on average approximately 8,493 employees during 2001. The Registrant believes its relationship with employees to be very good. The Registrant
has no collective bargaining contracts in the United States and eight such agreements affecting approximately 1,050 employees in its foreign subsidiaries.

International Operations

The Registrant is subject in varying degrees to certain risks typically associated with a global business, such as local economic and market conditions, exchange
and price controls, restrictions on investments, royalties and dividends and exchange rate fluctuations. Within the consumer and industrial segments, approximately one-third of net sales
in 2001 was from international operations.

For
additional information, see "Geographic Areas" within Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 45 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders
for 2001, which page is incorporated by reference, and the "Market Risk Sensitivity" section of "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on pages 28 and 29 of the Registrant's Annual Report to
Stockholders for 2001, which pages are incorporated by reference.

Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2001, which page is incorporated by reference.
