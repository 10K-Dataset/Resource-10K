Registrant's Proxy Statement dated 2/19/97     Part III, Part IV

                                PART I  

As used herein, the "Registrant" means McCormick & Company, Incorporated
and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS    

The Registrant, a diversified specialty food company, is principally
engaged in the manufacture of spices, seasonings, flavorings and other
specialty food products and sells such products to the retail food
market, the food service market and to industrial food processors
throughout the world.  The Registrant also, through subsidiary
corporations, manufactures and markets plastic packaging products for
the food, cosmetic and health care industries.    

The Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1996, which is
enclosed as Exhibit 13, contains a description of the general development
during the last fiscal year, of the business of the Registrant, which was
formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business
established in 1889.  Pages 7 through 13 of that Report are incorporated by
reference.  Unless otherwise indicated, all references to amounts in this
Report or in the Annual Report to Stockholders for 1996 are amounts from
continuing operations.  The Registrant's net sales increased 2.4% in 1996
to $ 1,732,506,000.

In March 1996, the Registrant formed a joint venture with Pioneer Products,
Inc. for the production and sale of dessert decorating products.  The new
company, Signature Brands, LLC, is located in Ocala, Florida and
manufactures and distributes a broad range of such products under the Betty
Crocker (a trademark owned by General Mills) and Cake Mate brand names. 

The Registrant implemented a restructuring plan in June 1996 which is
intended to increase focus on core businesses and improve its cost
structure.  A description of the actions taken under this plan are set
forth in the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1996 in Note 2
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 22 and 23 and on
pages 37 and 38, which pages are incorporated by reference.

In August 1996, the Registrant sold substantially all of the assets of
Gilroy Foods, Incorporated and Gilroy Energy Company, Inc. to ConAgra, Inc.
and to an affiliate of Calpine Corporation, respectively.  Gilroy Foods
manufactures and sells dehydrated onion, garlic, capsicum and vegetable
products.  Gilroy Energy operates an energy cogeneration facility.  The
Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1996 sets forth a
description of the sale of Gilroy Foods and Gilroy Energy on page 38 and in
Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 23.  Those
pages of the Registrant's Annual Report are incorporated by reference.

In 1994, the Registrant announced a restructuring plan which reduced the
work force and implemented a program to eliminate redundant facilities and
positions, improve production and efficiency and eliminate certain
businesses and product lines.  A description of the actions taken under
this plan are set forth in the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders
for 1996 in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 22 and 23 and on pages 37 and 38, which pages are incorporated by
reference.

The Registrant operates in two business segments, Food Products and
Packaging Products, and has disclosed in Note 10 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 31 and 32 of its Annual Report
to Stockholders for 1996, which Note is incorporated by reference, the
financial information about the business segments required by this Item.   

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS/MARKETING  

Spices, seasonings, flavorings and other specialty food products are the
Registrant's principal products.  The Registrant also manufactures and
markets plastic bottles and tubes for food, personal care and other
products, primarily in the United States.  The net sales value of each of
these product segments is set forth in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements on pages 31 and 32 of the Registrant's Annual Report
to Stockholders for 1996, which Note is incorporated by reference.  No
other products or classes of similar products or services contributed as
much as 10% to consolidated net sales during the last three fiscal years.  

The Registrant markets its food service products and consumer products
through its own sales organization, food brokers and distributors.  In the
industrial market, sales are made mostly through the Registrant's own sales
force.  The Registrant markets its packaging products through its own sales
force and distributors. 

RAW MATERIALS  

Many of the spices and herbs purchased by the Registrant are imported
into the United States from the country of origin, although significant 
quantities of some materials, such as paprika, dehydrated vegetables, onion
and garlic and food ingredients other than spices and herbs, originate in
the United States.  The Registrant is a direct importer of certain raw
materials, mainly black pepper, vanilla beans, cinnamon, herbs and seeds
from the countries of origin.  Some of the imported materials are purchased
from dealers in the United States.  The principal purpose of such purchases
is to satisfy the Registrant's own needs.  In addition, the Registrant
sells imported raw materials to other food processors.  The Registrant also
purchases cheese and dairy powders from U.S. sources for use in many
industrial products.  

The raw materials most important to the Registrant are onion, garlic and
capsicums (paprika and chili peppers), which are produced in the United
States, black pepper, most of which originates in India, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Brazil, and vanilla beans, a large proportion of which the
Registrant obtains from the Malagasy Republic and Indonesia.  The
Registrant does not anticipate any material restrictions or shortages on
the availability of raw materials which would have a significant impact
on the Registrant's business in the foreseeable future.

Substantially all of the raw materials used in the packaging business
originate in the United States.

TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND PATENTS   

The Registrant owns a number of registered trademarks, which in the
aggregate may be material to the Registrant's business.  However, the
loss of any one of those trademarks, with the exception of the Registrant's
"McCormick," "Schilling," "Schwartz" and "Club House" trademarks, would not
have a material adverse impact on the Registrant's business.  The
"McCormick" and "Schilling" trademarks are extensively used by the
Registrant in connection with the sale of a substantial number of the
Registrant's products in the United States.  The "McCormick" and
"Schilling" trademarks are registered and used in various foreign countries
as well.  The "Schwartz" trademark is used by the Registrant in connection
with the sale of the Registrant's products in Europe and the "Club House"
trademark is used in connection with the sale of the Registrant's products
in Canada.  The terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by
law and the registrations will be renewed for as long as the Registrant
deems them to be useful.  

The Registrant has entered into a number of license agreements
authorizing the use of its trademarks by persons in foreign countries. 
In the aggregate, the loss of those license agreements would not have a
material adverse impact on the Registrant's business.  The terms of the
license agreements are generally 3 to 5 years or until such time as
either party terminates the agreement.  Those agreements with specific
terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties.     

The Registrant owns various patents, but they are not viewed as material
to the Registrant's business.

SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS   

Historically, the Registrant's sales and profits are lower in the first
two quarters of the fiscal year and increase in the third and fourth
quarters.  

WORKING CAPITAL

In order to meet increased demand for its products during its fourth
quarter, the Registrant usually builds its inventories during the second
and third quarters.  In common with other companies, the Registrant
generally finances working capital items (inventory and receivables)
through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit
and the issuance of commercial paper.  The Registrant's Annual Report to
Stockholders for 1996 sets forth a description of the Registrant's
liquidity and capital resources on pages 41 and 42, which pages are
incorporated by reference.

CUSTOMERS 

The Registrant has a large number of customers for its products.  No
single customer accounted for as much as 10% of consolidated net sales
in 1996.  In the same year, sales to the five largest customers
represented approximately 20% of consolidated net sales.

BACKLOG ORDERS 

The dollar amount of backlog orders of the Registrant's business is not
material to an understanding of the Registrant's business, taken as a
whole.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS     

No material portion of the Registrant's business is subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at
the election of the Government.

COMPETITION    

Although the Registrant is a leader in sales of certain spices and
seasoning and flavoring products, its business is highly competitive.  For
further discussion, see pages 8 through 12, 37 and 39 of the Registrant's
Annual Report to Stockholders for 1996, which pages are incorporated by
reference.

RESARCH AND QUALITY CONTROL  

The Registrant has emphasized quality and innovation in the development,
production and packaging of its products.  Many of the Registrant's
products are prepared from confidential formulae developed by its
research laboratories and product development departments.  The long
experience of the Registrant in its field contributes substantially to
the quality of the products offered for sale.  Quality specifications
exist for the Registrant's products, and continuing quality control
inspections and testing are performed.  Total expenditures for these and
other related activities during fiscal years 1996, 1995 and 1994 were
approximately $35,705,000, $33,825,000 and $34,050,000 respectively.  Of
these amounts, expenditures for research and development amounted to
$12,216,000 in 1996, $12,015,000 in 1995 and $11,162,000 in 1994.  The
amount spent on customer-sponsored research activities is not material.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS     

Compliance with Federal, State and local provisions related to
protection of the environment has had no material effect on the
Registrant's business.  No material capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities are expected to be made during this
fiscal year or the next.

EMPLOYEES 

The Registrant had on average approximately 8,400 employees during fiscal
year 1996 and approximately 7,300 employees on November 30, 1996.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS  

International businesses have made significant contributions to the
Registrant's growth and profits.  In common with other companies with
foreign operations, the Registrant is subject in varying degrees to
certain risks typically associated with doing business abroad, such as
local economic and market conditions, exchange and price controls,
restrictions on investment, royalties and dividends and exchange rate
fluctuations.  

Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 31 and
32 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1996, and pages 38
through 41 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 1996
contain the information required by subsection (d) of Item 101 of
Regulation S-K, which pages are incorporated by reference.
