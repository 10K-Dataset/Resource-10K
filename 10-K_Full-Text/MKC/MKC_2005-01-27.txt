PART
I

As used herein, the “Registrant” means McCormick
& Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise
requires.

Item 1. 
Business

The Registrant, a diversified specialty food
company, is a global leader in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of
spices, herbs, seasonings and other flavors to the entire food industry. The
Registrant was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business
established in 1889.

The Registrant operates in two business
segments: consumer and industrial. The Registrant sold its packaging segment
during the third quarter of 2003. The consumer segment sells seasoning blends,
spices, herbs, extracts, sauces, marinades and specialty foods to the consumer
food market under a variety of brands, including “McCormick” and “Zatarain’s”
in the US, “Ducros” and “Silvo” in continental Europe, “Club House” in Canada
and “Schwartz” in the U.K. The industrial segment sells blended seasonings,
spices and herbs, condiments, compound flavors and extracts, and coating
systems to food processors, restaurants, distributors, warehouse clubs and
institutional operations.

Please refer to pages 8 through 11, “Consumer
Business,” pages 12 through 15 “Industrial Business,” and pages 16 and 17,
“Q&A with Bob Lawless,” of the Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders
for 2004 for a description of the business. Such pages of the Registrant’s
Annual Report to Stockholders for 2004 are incorporated herein by reference.

For financial information about the
Registrant’s business segments, please refer to pages 21 through 34,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” and Note 16, “Business Segments and


Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 53 and 54 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for 2004, which pages are
incorporated herein by reference.

Raw Materials

The most significant raw materials to the
Registrant are vanilla, cheese, pepper, packaging supplies, garlic, onion and
capsicums.  Black pepper, vanilla beans
and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the
United States. The Registrant is not aware of any government restrictions or
other factors that would have a material adverse effect on the availability of
these raw materials. Because the raw materials are agricultural products, they
may be subject to price volatility caused by weather and other unpredictable
factors.  The Registrant responds to this
volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases,
purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments.

Customers

The Registrant’s products are sold directly
and through brokers, wholesalers and distributors. In the consumer segment,
products are generally resold to consumers through grocery, drug, dollar and
mass merchandise stores. These customers are serviced either through direct
shipments, through the food wholesale channel, or by direct store
delivery.  In the industrial segment,
products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their
finished goods and by food service customers to enhance the flavor of their
foods. Customers for the industrial segment include food processors and the
restaurant industry, supplied both directly and through distributors and warehouse
clubs.

The Registrant has a large number of
customers for its products.  No single
customer accounted for as much as 10% of consolidated net sales in 2004. Sales
to the Registrant’s five largest customers represented approximately 32% of
consolidated net sales.

The dollar amount of backlog orders of the
Registrant’s business is not material to an understanding of the Registrant’s
business, taken as a whole.  No material
portion of the Registrant’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or
termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S.
Government.

Trademarks, Licenses and Patents

The Registrant owns a number of trademark
registrations.  Although in the aggregate
these trademarks may be material to the Registrant’s business, the loss of any
one of those trademarks, with the exception of the Registrant’s “McCormick,”
“Zatarain’s,” “Schwartz,” “Club House” and “Ducros”  trademarks, would not have a material adverse
effect on the Registrant’s business. The “McCormick” trademark is extensively
used by the Registrant in connection with the sale of virtually all of the
Registrant’s food products worldwide. The terms of the trademark registrations
are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be renewed for as long as
the Registrant deems them to be useful.

The Registrant has entered into a number of
license agreements authorizing the use of its trademarks by affiliated and
non-affiliated entities. The loss of these license agreements would not have a
material adverse effect on the Registrant’s business.  The term of the license agreements is
generally 3 to 5 years or until such time as either party terminates the
agreement.  Those agreements with specific
terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties.

The Registrant owns various patents, but they are not viewed as
material to the Registrant’s business.


Seasonal Nature of Business

Due to seasonal factors inherent in the
business, the Registrant’s sales and income are lower in the first two quarters
of the fiscal year and increase in the third and fourth quarters. The
seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the
consumer segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand for its consumer
products during its fourth quarter, the Registrant usually builds its
inventories during the third quarter. The Registrant generally finances working
capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings, which
include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper.  For a description of the Registrant’s
liquidity and capital resources, see Note 7 “Financing Arrangements” of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 46 and 47 of the
Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2004, which pages are
incorporated by reference, and the “Financial Condition” section of
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis” on pages 26 through 28 of the
Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2004, which pages are
incorporated by reference.

Competition

The Registrant is a global leader in the
manufacture and sale of spices, herbs, extracts, seasonings and flavorings and
competes in a geographic market that is international and highly competitive.
For further discussion, see page 21 of the Registrant’s Annual Report to
Stockholders for 2004, which page is incorporated by reference.

Research and Development

Many of the Registrant’s products are
prepared from confidential formulae developed by its research laboratories and
product development teams. Expenditures for research and development amounted
to $39.3 million in 2004, $33.2 million in 2003 and $31.4 million in 2002. The
amount spent on customer-sponsored research activities is not material.

Environmental Regulations

Compliance with Federal, State and local
provisions related to protection of the environment has had no material effect
on the Registrant’s business. There were no material capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities in 2004 and there are no material expenditures
planned for such purposes in 2005.

Employees

The Registrant had approximately 8,000
employees worldwide as of December 31, 2004. The Registrant believes its
relationship with employees to be good. The Registrant has no collective
bargaining contracts in the United States. At the Registrant’s foreign
subsidiaries, approximately 1,200 employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements or similar arrangements.

reference, and the “Market Risk Sensitivity” section of “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis” on page 30 of the Registrant’s Annual Report to
Stockholders for 2004, which page is incorporated by reference.

Foreign Operations

The Registrant is subject in varying degrees
to certain risks typically associated with a global business, such as local
economic and market conditions, restrictions on investments, royalties and
dividends and exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 38% of net sales in
2004 were from international operations.

The Registrant’s principal executive offices
and primary research facilities are owned and are located in suburban
Baltimore, Maryland.

The following is a list of the Registrant’s
principal manufacturing properties, all of which are owned except for the
facilities in Commerce, California and Sydney, Australia, which are leased:


In addition to distribution facilities and
warehouse space available at its manufacturing facilities, the Registrant
leases regional distribution facilities in Belcamp, Maryland, Salinas, California
and Dallas, Texas and owns a distribution facility in Monteux, France.  The Registrant also owns or leases several
other properties used for manufacturing consumer and industrial products and
for sales, distribution and administrative functions.

The Registrant believes its plants are well
maintained and suitable for their intended use. The Registrant further believes
that these plants generally have adequate capacity and can accommodate seasonal
demands, changing product mixes and certain additional growth. Many additions
and improvements have been made to these facilities over the years and the
plants’ manufacturing equipment includes equipment of the latest type and
technology.
