Registrant’s
  Proxy Statement dated February 16, 2007

Part
  III

PART I

As used herein, the “Registrant”
means McCormick & Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries, unless the
context otherwise requires.

Item 1.  Business

The Registrant, a diversified
specialty food company, is a global leader in the manufacture, marketing and
distribution of spices, herbs, seasoning blends and other flavors to the entire
food industry. The Registrant was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the
successor to a business established in 1889.

The Registrant operates in two
business segments: consumer and industrial.

The consumer segment sells
spices, herbs, extracts, seasoning blends, sauces, marinades and specialty
foods to the consumer food market under a variety of brands, including “McCormick,”
“Zatarain’s,” “Simply Asia” and “Thai Kitchens” in the US, “Ducros,” “Vahine”
and “Silvo” in continental Europe, “Club House” in Canada and “Schwartz” in the
U.K. The industrial segment sells seasoning blends, natural spices and herbs,
wet flavors, coating systems and compound flavors to food manufacturers and the
food service industry, served both directly and indirectly through
distributors.

Please
refer to pages 18 and 19, of the Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for
2006 for descriptions of our consumer and industrial businesses, and pages 7
through 13, of the Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2006 for a
discussion of growth initiatives for the business. Such pages of the Registrant’s
Annual Report to Stockholders for 2006 are incorporated herein by reference.

For
financial information about the Registrant’s business segments, please refer to
pages 20 through 24, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” and Note 15, “Business
Segments and Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 55 and 56 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for 2006,
which pages are incorporated herein by reference.


Raw Materials

The most significant raw materials to
the Registrant are cheese, pepper, capsicums, garlic, onion and vanilla.  Pepper, vanilla beans and other spices and
herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the United States.
Others, like onion, are primarily sourced from within the United States. The
Registrant is not aware of any government restrictions or other factors that
would have a material adverse effect on the availability of these raw
materials. Because the raw materials are agricultural products, they may be
subject to price volatility caused by weather and other unpredictable
factors.  The Registrant responds to this
volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases,
purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments.

Customers

The Registrant’s products are sold
directly to customers and also through brokers, wholesalers and distributors.
In the consumer segment, products are resold to consumers through retail
outlets, including grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount and
drug stores under a variety of brands. 
In the industrial segment, products are used by food and beverage
manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by food service
customers as ingredients for menu items to enhance the flavor of their foods.
Customers for the industrial segment include food manufacturers and the food
service industry, which are supplied both directly and through distributors.

The Registrant has a large
number of customers for its products.  No
single customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in
2006.  Sales to the Registrant’s five
largest customers represented approximately 29.6% of consolidated net sales.

The dollar amount of backlog orders
of the Registrant’s business is not material to an understanding of the
Registrant’s business, taken as a whole. 
No material portion of the Registrant’s business is subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the
election of the U.S. Government.

Trademarks, Licenses and Patents

The Registrant owns a number of
trademark registrations.  Although in the
aggregate these trademarks may be material to the Registrant’s business, the
loss of any one of those trademarks, with the exception of the Registrant’s “McCormick,”
“Club House,” “Ducros,” “Schwartz,” “Vahine” and “Zatarain’s” trademarks, would
not have a material adverse effect on the Registrant’s business. The “McCormick”
trademark is extensively used by the Registrant in connection with the sale of
virtually all of the Registrant’s food products worldwide. The terms of the
trademark registrations are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be
renewed for as long as the Registrant deems them to be useful.

The Registrant has entered into
a number of license agreements authorizing the use of its trademarks by
affiliated and non-affiliated entities. The loss of these license agreements
would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrant’s business.  The term of the license agreements is
generally three to five years or until such time as either party terminates the
agreement.  Those agreements with
specific terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties.

The
Registrant owns various patents, but they are not viewed as material to the
Registrant’s business.


Seasonal Nature of Business

Due to seasonal factors inherent
in the business, the Registrant’s sales, income and cash from operations
generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year, increase in
the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter. The
seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the
consumer segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand for
its consumer products during its fourth quarter, the Registrant usually builds
its inventories during the third quarter. The Registrant generally finances
working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term
borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of
commercial paper.  For a description of
the Registrant’s liquidity and capital resources, see Note 7 “Financing
Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 49 and
50 of the Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2006, which page is
incorporated by reference, and the “Liquidity and Financial Condition” section
of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” on pages 24 through 26 of the
Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2006, which pages are
incorporated by reference.

Competition

The Registrant is a global leader in
the manufacture and sale of spices, herbs, extracts, seasoning blends and
flavorings and competes in a geographic market that is international and highly
competitive. For further discussion, see pages 18 and 19 of the Registrant’s
Annual Report to Stockholders for 2006, which pages are incorporated by
reference.

Research and Development

Many of the Registrant’s products are
prepared from confidential formulae developed by its research laboratories and
product development teams. Expenditures for research and development were $43.6
million in 2006, $43.1 million in 2005 and $39.3 million in 2004. The amount
spent on customer-sponsored research activities is not material.

Environmental Regulations

The cost of compliance with federal,
state and local provisions related to protection of the environment has had no
material effect on the Registrant’s business. There were no material capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2006 and there are no
material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2007.


Employees

The
Registrant had approximately 7,500 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2006.
The Registrant believes its relationship with employees to be good. The
Registrant has no collective bargaining contracts in the United States. At the
Registrant’s foreign subsidiaries, approximately 840 employees are covered by
collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements.

Financial Information About
Geographic Locations

For information on the net sales and
long-lived assets of the Registrant, see Note 15, “Business Segments and
Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 55
and 56 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for 2006, and the “Market Risk
Sensitivity” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” on pages 29
through 31 of the Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2006, which
pages are incorporated by reference.

Foreign Operations

The Registrant is subject in varying
degrees to certain risks typically associated with a global business, such as
local economic and market conditions, restrictions on investments, royalties
and dividends and exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 38% of sales in
2006 were from international operations.

Forward-Looking Information

For a discussion of forward-looking
information, see the “Forward-Looking Information” section of “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis” on page 34 of the Registrant’s Annual Report to
Stockholders for 2006, which page is incorporated by reference.

Available
Information

The Registrant’s Internet
website address is: www.mccormick.com. The Registrant makes available free of
charge through its website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or
furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as
reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC.  The Registrant’s
website also includes the Registrant’s Corporate Governance Guidelines,
Business Ethics Policy and charters of its Audit Committee, Compensation
Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee.  These documents are also available in print
to any shareholder upon request.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

The
following are certain risk factors that could affect the Registrant’s business,
financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors should be
considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements
contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause
the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in
forward-looking statements. Before you buy the Registrant’s common stock, you
should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the
risks described below. The risks that are highlighted


here are not the only ones that
the Registrant faces.  If any of the
risks actually occur, the Registrant’s business, financial condition or results
of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of
the Registrant’s securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your
investment.

Price Fluctuations In The Raw
Material Markets May Negatively Impact Us.

The
Registrant purchases certain

raw materials which are subject to price volatility
caused by weather, market conditions, growing and harvesting conditions,
governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. The most significant
raw materials are cheese,
pepper, capsicums, garlic, onion and vanilla.
While future movements of raw
material costs are uncertain, the Registrant responds to this volatility in a
number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw
material for future delivery and customer price adjustments. The Registrant has
not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk.  Any actions the Registrant may take in
response to price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate its
exposure to a decline in operating results due to changes in raw material
prices. Therefore, the Registrant cannot assure you that future raw material
price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial
condition or operating results.

Fluctuations In The Foreign
Currency Markets May Negatively Impact Us.

The
Registrant is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows primarily
related to raw material purchases. The Registrant is also exposed to
fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and
unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these
investments. Additionally, the Registrant is exposed to volatility in the
translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars. Primary exposures
include the U.S. dollar versus the functional currencies of our major markets
(Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso
and Chinese renminbi). On occasion, the Registrant may enter into forward and
option contracts to manage these foreign currency risks. However, these
contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate the Registrant’s exposure to a
decline in operating results due to foreign currency translation. Therefore,
the Registrant cannot assure you that future exchange rate fluctuations will
not have a negative impact on its business, financial position or operating
results.

Increases In Interest Rates May
Negatively Impact Us.

The
Registrant had total outstanding short-term borrowings of approximately $80.8
million at an average interest rate of approximately 5.5% on November 30, 2006.
The Registrant’s policy is to manage our interest costs using a mix of fixed
and variable rate debt. The Registrant also uses interest rate swaps to achieve
a desired proportion of fixed and variable rate debt. The Registrant utilizes
derivative financial instruments to enhance its ability to manage risk,
including interest rate exposures that exist as part of its ongoing business
operations. The Registrant does not enter into contracts for trading purposes,
nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instrument. The Registrant’s use
of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication
with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. However, its
use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate its exposure to
a decline in operating results due to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the
Registrant cannot assure you that future interest rate increases will not have
a material negative impact on its business, financial position or operating
results.

Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

The Registrant believes its plants are well maintained
and suitable for their intended use. The Registrant further believes that these
plants generally have adequate capacity and can accommodate seasonal demands,
changing product mixes and additional growth. Many additions and improvements
have been made to these facilities over the years and the plants’ manufacturing
equipment includes equipment of the latest type and technology.
