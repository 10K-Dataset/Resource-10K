DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

PART I

As used herein, references to “McCormick,” “we,” “us” and “our” are to McCormick & Company, Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries or, as the context may
require, McCormick & Company, Incorporated only.

Item 1.

Business

McCormick is a diversified specialty food
company and a global leader in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of flavor products (including spices, herbs, extracts, seasonings and flavorings) and other specialty food products to the entire food industry. Our major sales, distribution
and production facilities are located in North America and Europe. Additional facilities are located in Central America, Australia, China, Singapore, Thailand, and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under
Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889.

We operate in two
business segments: consumer and industrial. The consumer segment sells spices, herbs, extracts, seasoning blends, sauces, marinades, and specialty foods to the consumer food market under a variety of brands worldwide, including “McCormick

®

,” “Lawry’s

®

,” “Zatarain’s

®

,”
“Thai Kitchen

®

,” “Simply Asia

®

,” “Ducros

®

,” “Schwartz™,” “Vahine™,” “Silvo™, “Club House™,” and “Billy Bee™.” The industrial segment sells seasoning blends, natural spices and herbs,
wet flavors, coating systems, and compound flavors to food manufacturers and the food service industry both directly and indirectly through distributors.

Please refer to pages 16 through 18, of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008 for descriptions of our consumer and industrial businesses, and pages 5, 6, 7, and 8 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008 for
a discussion of growth initiatives for the business. These pages of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008, as well as all other page references to our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008 contained in this Form 10-K, are incorporated herein
by reference.

For financial information about our business segments, please refer to pages 19 through 24, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis – Results of Operations” of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008, and Note 16, “Business Segments and Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 61 and 62 of the
Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008.

For a discussion of our recent acquisition activity, please refer to pages 27 through 29,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Acquisitions” of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008, and Note 2, “Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 47 through 48 of the Annual Report to
Stockholders for 2008.

Raw Materials

The most significant raw materials used by us in our business are cheese, pepper, soybean oil, wheat, capsicums, onion, and garlic. Pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the United States. Other
raw materials, like cheese and onion, are primarily sourced from within the United States. We are not aware of any government restrictions or other factors that would have a material adverse effect on the availability of these raw materials. Because
the raw materials are agricultural products, they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, and other factors beyond our control. We respond to this
volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, and customer price adjustments.

Customers

McCormick’s products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers, wholesalers, and distributors.
In the consumer segment, products are resold to consumers through a variety of retail outlets, including grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount, and drug stores under a variety of brands. In the industrial segment, products are used by
food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by food service customers as ingredients for menu items to enhance the flavor of their foods. Customers for the industrial segment include food manufacturers and the food
service industry supplied both directly and indirectly through distributors.

We have a large number of customers for our products. In
fiscal years 2007 and 2008, sales to one of our customers, PepsiCo, Inc., accounted for approximately 10% of consolidated net sales. Sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 30% of consolidated net sales for the 2008 fiscal
year.

The dollar amount of backlog orders for our business is not material to an understanding of our business, taken as a whole. No
material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.

Trademarks, Licenses and Patents

McCormick owns a number of trademark registrations. Although in the aggregate these
trademarks may be material to our business, the loss of any one of those trademarks, with the exception of our “McCormick,” “Lawry’s,” “Zatarain’s,” “Club House,” “Ducros,”
“Schwartz,” and “Vahine,” trademarks, would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The “McCormick” trademark is extensively used by us in connection with the sale of our food products in the U.S. and
certain non-U.S. markets. The terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be renewed for as long as we deem them to be useful.

We have entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of our trademarks by affiliated and non-affiliated entities. The loss of these
license agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The term of the license agreements is generally three to five years or until such time as either party terminates the agreement. Those agreements with specific terms are
renewable upon agreement of the parties.

- 2 -

We also own various patents, none of which are viewed as material to our business.

Seasonality

Due to seasonal factors inherent in
McCormick’s business, our sales, income, and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year, increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. This
seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the consumer segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter, McCormick usually builds its inventories during the third quarter
of the fiscal year. We generally finance working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of our liquidity and capital
resources, see Note 7 “Financing Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 51 and 52 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008, and the “Liquidity and Financial Condition” section of
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis” on pages 24 through 27 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008.

Competition

McCormick competes in a geographic market that is international and highly competitive. Our strategies for competing in each of our segments include a
focus on price and value, product quality and innovation, and superior service. Additionally, in the consumer segment, we focus on brand recognition and loyalty, effective advertising, promotional programs, and the identification and satisfaction of
consumer preferences. For further discussion, see pages 16 through 18 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008.

Research and Development

Many of McCormick’s products are prepared from confidential formulas developed by our research laboratories and product
development teams, as well as from, in some cases, customer proprietary formulas. Expenditures for research and development were $51.0 million in 2008, $49.3 million in 2007, and $45.0 million in 2006. The amount spent on customer-sponsored research
activities is not material to us.

Environmental Regulations

The cost of compliance with federal, state, and local provisions related to protection of the environment has had no material effect on McCormick’s business. There were no material capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities in fiscal year 2008 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in fiscal year 2009.

- 3 -

Employees

McCormick had approximately 7,500 full time employees worldwide as of December 31, 2008. We believe our relationship with employees to be good. We have no collective bargaining contracts in the United States. At our foreign
subsidiaries, approximately 1,560 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements.

Financial Information about
Geographic Locations

For information on the net sales and long-lived assets of McCormick by geographic area, see Note 16,
“Business Segments and Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 61 and 62 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008, and the “Market Risk Sensitivity” section of “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis” on pages 32 through 34 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for 2008.

Foreign Operations

McCormick is subject in varying degrees to certain risks typically associated with a global business, such as local economic and market conditions,
restrictions on investments, royalties and dividends, and exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 42% of sales in fiscal year 2008 were from non-U.S. operations.

Forward-Looking Information

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following are certain risk
factors that could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these
factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Before you buy our Common Stock or Non-Voting Common Stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some
risks, including the risks described below. The risks that have been highlighted here are not the only ones that we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be negatively affected.
In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Damage to Our Reputation or Brand
Name or Loss of Brand Relevance due to Increased Private Label Use by Consumers Could Negatively Impact Us.

Our reputation for
manufacturing high-quality products is widely recognized. In order to safeguard that reputation, we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure conformity to specification and compliance with
law. We also continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brand through effective marketing and other measures. A serious breach of our quality
assurance or quality control procedures, deterioration of our quality image, impairment of our customer or consumer relationships, or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brand, which may lead to customers or consumers purchasing other
brands or private label brands that may or may not be manufactured by us, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Issues Regarding Procurement of Raw Materials May Negatively Impact Us.

Our purchases of raw
materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. The most significant raw materials used by us
in our business are cheese, pepper, soybean oil, wheat, capsicums, onion, and garlic. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways, including strategic raw material
purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, and customer price adjustments. We have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. Any actions taken in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively
limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.

In addition, we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the availability risk of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather
on crop yield, political unrest in the producing countries, changes in governmental agricultural programs, and other factors beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative
impact on our business, financial condition, or operating results.

Further, political, socio-economic, and cultural conditions, as well as
disruptions caused by terrorist activities, in developing countries create risks for food safety. Although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products, we
cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.

- 5 -

Our Profitability May Suffer as a Result of Competition in Our Markets.

The food industry is intensely competitive. Competition in our product categories is based on price, product innovation, product quality, brand
recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. From time to time, we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and
customer pressures. Such pressures also may impair our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases.

Our
Operations may be Impaired as a Result of Disasters, Business Interruptions or Similar Events.

A natural disaster such as an
earthquake, fire, flood, or severe storm, or a catastrophic event such as a terrorist attack, an epidemic affecting our operating activities, major facilities, or employees’ and customers’ health, or a computer system failure, could cause
an interruption or delay in our business and loss of inventory and/or data or render us unable to accept and fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas
that are susceptible to harsh weather; a major storm, heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner.

We cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue, and our business interruption insurance may not
adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that an earthquake, natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for
any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be seriously harmed.

We May Not Be Able to Successfully Consummate Proposed Acquisitions or Divestitures or Integrate Acquired Businesses.

From time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These potential
acquisitions and divestitures may present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems,
increased expenses, assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers. In addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible
assets) in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce its profitability. For example, as reported on the Form 8-K filed by us on November 25, 2008, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge representing a reduction in the value of our
Silvo brand, which was acquired by us in 2004. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our financial results could be adversely
affected.

- 6 -

Our Failure to Successfully Integrate the Recently Purchased Assets of the Lawry’s Business into Our Existing
Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Results.

On July 31, 2008,
we completed our previously announced purchase from Conopco, Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Unilever N.V., of specified assets used in connection with the manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sale of food products under the
“Lawry’s” and “Adolph’s

®

” brands. As previously announced, the terms of the order from the Federal Trade Commission for the acquisition required the sale of
our Season-All business, and in accordance with these terms, on July 31, 2008, we completed the sale of our Season-All business to Morton International Inc. There may be risks or costs resulting from the Lawry’s acquisition that are not
presently known to us. Various factors may be necessary for us to achieve our objectives with respect to the acquisition and/or avoid increases in the costs associated with the acquisition, including continued customer acceptance of the Lawry’s
and Adolph’s product lines, the successful integration of the Lawry’s business into our business, and the completion of transition services agreements with Conopco, Inc., for the Lawry’s business, and with Morton International Inc.,
for the Season-All business.

Our Foreign Operations are Subject to Additional Risks.

We operate our business and market our products internationally. In fiscal year 2008, 42% of our sales were generated in foreign countries.
Our foreign operations are subject to additional risks, including fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, discriminatory fiscal policies, compliance with foreign laws, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions,
and other economic or political uncertainties. Additionally, international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions. All of these risks could result in increased costs or
decreased revenues, either of which could adversely affect our profitability.

Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Markets May Negatively
Impact Us.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material
purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars; the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Primary exposures include
the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, and Thai baht. We routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing foreign currency risks.
However, these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a
negative impact on our business, financial position, or operating results.

- 7 -

The Consolidation of Customers May Put Pressures on Our Operating Margins and Profitability.

Our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue
throughout the U.S., the European Union, and other major markets. Such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable
of operating with reduced inventories, resisting price increases, demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products, and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label products. These
factors and others could have an adverse impact on our future sales growth and profitability.

Increases in Interest Rates May Negatively Impact Us.

We had total outstanding short-term borrowings of approximately $303.1 million at an average interest rate of approximately 2.1% on
November 30, 2008. Our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and
variable rate debt. We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor
are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. Our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. However, our use of these instruments
may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future interest rate increases will not have a material negative impact on our business, financial position, or operating
results.

The Deterioration of Credit and Capital Markets May Adversely Affect our Access to Sources of Funding.

We rely on our revolving credit facilities, or borrowings backed by these facilities, to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other
general corporate purposes. If any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements. In
addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding. In the event we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that
we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time, if at all. Our inability to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us could have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, and
liquidity.

- 8 -

We Face Risks Associated With Certain Pension Obligations.

We hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans. A deterioration in the value of plan assets, driven by a
decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from general financial downturn or otherwise, could cause (or increase) an underfunded status of our primary defined benefit pension plan, thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the
plan. For example, from November 2007 to November 2008, our primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan moved from an overfunded to underfunded status driven by decreased plan asset values resulting from the global financial turndown. An obligation to
make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.

The Global Financial Downturn Exposes Us to Credit Risks from Customers and Counterparties.

Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged. In addition,
competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Current credit markets are highly volatile, and
some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or
counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.
