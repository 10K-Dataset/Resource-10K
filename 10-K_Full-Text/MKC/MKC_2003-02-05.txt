Registrant's 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders

Part I, Part II, Part IV

Registrant's Proxy Statement dated February 18, 2003

Part III

PART I

As used herein, the "Registrant" means McCormick & Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.

Item 1. Business

The Registrant, a diversified specialty food company, is a global leader in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of spices, herbs, seasonings, flavorings
and other specialty food products to the entire food industry. The Registrant also, through subsidiary corporations, manufactures and markets specialty plastic bottles and tubes for food, personal
care and other industries. The Registrant was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889.

The
Registrant operates in three business segments: consumer, industrial and packaging. The consumer segment sells spices, herbs, extracts, proprietary seasoning blends, sauces and
marinades to the consumer food market under a variety of brands, including "McCormick", "Ducros" in continental Europe, "Club House" in Canada, and "Schwartz" in the U.K. The industrial segment sells
spices, herbs, extracts, proprietary seasonings, condiments, coatings and compound flavors to food processors, restaurant chains, distributors, warehouse clubs and institutional operations. The
packaging segment manufactures and markets plastic packaging products to the food, personal care and other industries, primarily in the U.S. Tubes and bottles are also produced for the Registrant's
food segment.

Please
refer to pages 5 through 13 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2002, which is attached as Exhibit 13, for a more detailed description of the business.
Please also refer to pages 17 through 28, "Management's Discussion and Analysis," and Note 15 "Business Segments and Geographic Areas" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages
42 and 43 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for 2002, for financial information about the Registrant's business segments. Such pages of the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2002 are
incorporated herein by reference.

Unless
otherwise indicated, all references to amounts in this Report or in the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2002 are amounts from continuing operations.

Raw Materials

Many of the spices and herbs purchased by the Registrant are imported into the U.S. from the country of origin, although significant quantities of some materials,
such as paprika, dehydrated vegetables, onion and garlic, and food ingredients other than spices and herbs, originate in the U.S. The Registrant is a direct importer of certain raw materials, mainly
black pepper, vanilla beans, cinnamon, herbs and seeds from their countries of origin. In addition, the Registrant also purchases wheat flour, soy oil and cheese and dairy powders from U.S. sources
for use in many industrial products.

The
raw materials most important to the Registrant are wheat flour, black pepper, soy oil, cheese and vanilla beans. The Registrant is not aware of any restrictions or other factors that
would have a material adverse effect on the availability of these raw materials. Because the raw materials are agricultural products, the Registrant uses a combination of open market purchases and
advance purchase commitments, most of which are less than one year in duration, to minimize volatility in price and uncertainty of supply.

Substantially
all of the raw materials used in the packaging segment originate in the U.S.


Customers

The Registrant's products are sold through its own sales organization, brokers and distributors. In the consumer segment, these products are generally resold to
consumers through grocery, mass merchandise, drug and other retail outlets. In the industrial segment, these products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished
goods and by foodservice customers to enhance the flavor of their foods. In the packaging segment, plastic bottles and tubes are sold to pharmaceutical, cosmetics and other companies in the personal
care industry as well as to the food industry.

The
Registrant has a large number of customers for its products. No single customer accounted for as much as 10% of consolidated net sales in 2002. Sales to the Registrant's five largest
customers represented approximately 27% of consolidated net sales.

The
dollar amount of backlog orders of the Registrant's business is not material to an understanding of the Registrant's business, taken as a whole. No material portion of the
Registrant's business is subject
to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. Government.

Trademarks, Licenses and Patents

The Registrant owns a number of trademark registrations. Although in the aggregate these trademarks may be material to the Registrant's business, the loss of any
one of those trademarks, with the exception of the Registrant's "McCormick," "Schwartz," "Club House" and "Ducros" trademarks, would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrant's business.
The "McCormick" trademark is extensively used by the Registrant in connection with the sale of virtually all of the Registrant's food products worldwide, with the exception of Canada, Europe and the
U.K. The terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be renewed for as long as the Registrant deems them to be useful.

The
Registrant has entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of its trademarks by affiliated and non-affiliated entities. In the aggregate, the loss of
license agreements with non-affiliated entities would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrant's business. The term of the license agreements is generally 3 to 5 years
or until such time as either party terminates the agreement. Those agreements with specific terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties.

The
Registrant owns various patents, but they are not viewed as material to the Registrant's business.

Seasonal Nature of Business

Due to seasonal factors inherent in the business, the Registrant's sales and income are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year and increase in the
third and fourth quarters. The seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the consumer segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand for its products during its fourth quarter, the Registrant usually builds its inventories during the third quarter. The
Registrant generally finances working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial
paper. For a description of the Registrant's liquidity and capital resources, see Note 6 "Financing Arrangements" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 37 of the
Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2002, which page is incorporated by reference, and the "Financial Condition" section of "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on pages


22 and 23 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2002, which pages are incorporated by reference.

Competition

The Registrant is a global leader in the manufacture and sale of spices, herbs, extracts, seasonings and flavorings and competes in a geographic market that is
international and highly competitive. For further discussion, see pages 5 through 10 in the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2002, which pages are incorporated by reference.

Research and Quality Control

The Registrant has emphasized quality and innovation in the development, production and packaging of its products. Many of the Registrant's products are prepared
from confidential formulae developed by its research laboratories and product development departments. The long experience of the Registrant in its field contributes substantially to the quality of
the products offered for sale. Quality specifications exist for the Registrant's products, and continuing quality control inspections and testing are performed. Total expenditures for these and other
related activities during fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately $59.9 million, $53.0 million and $48.4 million, respectively. Of these amounts, expenditures for
research and development amounted to $31.4 million in 2002, $27.1 million in 2001 and $24.9 million in 2000. The amount spent on customer-sponsored research activities is not
material.

Environmental Regulations

Compliance with Federal, State and local provisions related to protection of the environment has had no material effect on the Registrant's business. There were
no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2002 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2003.

Employees

The Registrant had approximately 9,000 employees worldwide as of December 31, 2002. The Registrant believes its relationship with employees to be very
good. The Registrant has no collective bargaining
contracts in the United States and nine such agreements affecting approximately 1,050 employees in its foreign subsidiaries.

Financial Information About Geographic Locations

For information on the revenues and long-lived assets of the registrant, see "Geographic Areas" within Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements on page 43 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2002, which page is incorporated by reference, and the "Market Risk Sensitivity" section of "Management's
Discussion and Analysis" on pages 24 and 25 of the Registrant's Annual Report to Stockholders for 2002, which pages are incorporated by reference.

Foreign Operations

The Registrant is subject in varying degrees to certain risks typically associated with a global business, such as local economic and market conditions, exchange
and price controls, restrictions on investments, royalties and dividends and exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately one-third of net sales in 2002 were from international operations.
