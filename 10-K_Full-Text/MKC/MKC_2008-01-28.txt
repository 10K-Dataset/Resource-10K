PART I

As used herein, the “Registrant”
means McCormick & Company, Incorporated and its subsidiaries, unless
the context otherwise requires.

Item 1.  Business

The
Registrant is a diversified specialty food company and a global leader in the
manufacture, marketing and distribution of flavor products (including spices,
herbs, extracts, seasonings and flavorings) and other specialty food products
to the entire food industry. The Registrant’s major sales, distribution and
production facilities are located in North America and Europe. Additional
facilities are located in Mexico, Central America, Australia, China, Singapore,
Thailand and South Africa.

The Registrant was formed in 1915 under Maryland
law as the successor to a business established in 1889.

The Registrant operates in two
business segments: consumer and industrial. The consumer segment sells spices,
herbs, extracts, seasoning blends, sauces, marinades and specialty foods to the
consumer food market under a variety of brands worldwide, including
“McCormick,” “Zatarain’s,” “Simply Asia,” “Thai Kitchen,” “Ducros,” “Vahine,”
“Silvo,” “Club House” and “Schwartz.”  The industrial segment sells
seasoning blends, natural spices and herbs, wet flavors, coating systems and
compound flavors to food manufacturers and the food service industry, served
both directly and indirectly through distributors.

Please refer to pages 15
through 17, of the Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2007 for
descriptions of the Registrant’s consumer and industrial businesses, and pages 6,
7, 8, 11 and 16 of the Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2007 for
a discussion of growth initiatives for the business. Such pages of the
Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2007 are incorporated by
reference.

For financial information about
the Registrant’s business segments, please refer to pages 18 through 22,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” and Note 14, “Business Segments and
Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 57
and 58 of the Annual Report to Stockholders for 2007, which pages are
incorporated by reference.

For a discussion of the
Registrant’s recent acquisition activity, please refer to page 25,  “Management’s Discussion and Analysis,” and
Note 2, “Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 45
of the Annual Report to Stockholders for 2007, which pages are
incorporated by reference.

Raw Materials

The
most significant raw materials to the Registrant are cheese, pepper, soybean
oil, wheat, sweeteners, capsicums, garlic and onion.  Pepper and other spices and herbs are
generally sourced from countries other than the United States. Others, like
cheese and onion, are primarily sourced from within the United States. The Registrant
is not aware of any government restrictions or other factors that would have a
material adverse effect on the availability of these raw materials. Because the
raw materials are agricultural products, they are subject to fluctuations in
market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting
conditions, market conditions and other factors beyond the Registrant’s
control.  The Registrant responds to this
volatility in a number of ways including strategic raw material purchases,
purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments.

Customers

The
Registrant’s products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers,
wholesalers and distributors. In the consumer segment, products are resold to
consumers through retail outlets, including grocery, mass merchandise,
warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores under a variety of brands.  In the industrial segment, products are used
by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and
by food service customers as ingredients for menu items to enhance the flavor
of their foods. Customers for the industrial segment include food manufacturers
and the food service industry, which are supplied both directly and through
distributors.

The Registrant has a large
number of customers for its products.  In
fiscal year 2007, sales to one of the Registrant’s customers, PepsiCo, Inc.,
accounted for 10% of consolidated net sales. 
Sales to the Registrant’s five largest customers represented approximately

28.5

% of consolidated net sales for this period.

The
dollar amount of backlog orders of the Registrant’s business is not material to
an understanding of the Registrant’s business, taken as a whole.  No material portion of the Registrant’s
business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or
subcontracts at the election of the U.S. Government.


Trademarks, Licenses and
Patents

The
Registrant owns a number of trademark registrations.  Although in the aggregate these trademarks
may be material to the Registrant’s business, the loss of any one of those
trademarks, with the exception of the Registrant’s “McCormick,” “Club House,”
“Ducros,” “Schwartz,” “Vahine” and “Zatarain’s” trademarks, would not have a
material adverse effect on the Registrant’s business. The “McCormick” trademark
is extensively used by the Registrant in connection with the sale of virtually
all of the Registrant’s food products worldwide. The terms of the trademark
registrations are as prescribed by law and the registrations will be renewed
for as long as the Registrant deems them to be useful.

The Registrant has entered into
a number of license agreements authorizing the use of its trademarks by
affiliated and non-affiliated entities. The loss of these license agreements
would not have a material adverse effect on the Registrant’s business.  The term of the license agreements is
generally three to five years or until such time as either party terminates the
agreement.  Those agreements with
specific terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties.

The
Registrant owns various patents, but they are not viewed as material to the
Registrant’s business.

Seasonality

Due to seasonal factors inherent
in the business, the Registrant’s sales, income and cash from operations
generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year, increase in
the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the
holiday season. The seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns,
primarily in the consumer segment.

Working Capital

In
order to meet increased demand for its consumer products during its fourth
quarter, the Registrant usually builds its inventories during the third quarter.
The Registrant generally finances working capital items (inventory and
receivables) through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of
credit and the issuance of commercial paper. 
For a description of the Registrant’s liquidity and capital resources,
see Note


“Financing
Arrangements” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages


and 49 of the Registrant’s Annual
Report to Stockholders for 2007, which pages are incorporated by
reference, and the “Liquidity and Financial Condition” section of “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis” on pages


through 25
of the Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2007, which pages are
incorporated by reference.

Competition

The
Registrant is a global leader in the manufacture and sale of flavor products
(including spices, herbs, extracts, seasonings and flavorings) and other
specialty food products, and competes in a geographic market that is
international and highly competitive. The Registrant’s strategies for competing
in each of its segments include a focus on price and value, product quality and
innovation, and superior service.  Additionally, in the consumer segment,
the Registrant focuses on brand recognition and loyalty, effective advertising
and promotional programs, and the identification and satisfaction of consumer
preferences.  For further discussion, see pages 12, and 15 through 17
of the Registrant’s Annual Report to Stockholders for 2007, which pages are
incorporated by reference.


Research
and Development

Many of the Registrant’s
products are prepared from confidential formulae developed by its research
laboratories and product development teams. Expenditures for research and
development were $

49.3

million in
2007, $45.0 million in 2006 and $43.1 million in 2005. The amount spent on
customer-sponsored research activities is not material.

Environmental Regulations

The
cost of compliance with federal, state and local provisions related to
protection of the environment has had no material effect on the Registrant’s
business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control
facilities in 2007 and there are no material expenditures planned for such
purposes in 2008.

Employees

The Registrant had approximately

7,500

employees
worldwide as of December 31, 2007. The Registrant believes its
relationship with employees to be good. The Registrant has no collective
bargaining contracts in the United States. At the Registrant’s foreign
subsidiaries, approximately

1,200

employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements or similar arrangements.

of the Registrant’s Annual Report to
Stockholders for 2007, which pages are incorporated by reference.

Foreign Operations

The
Registrant is subject in varying degrees to certain risks typically associated
with a global business, such as local economic and market conditions,
restrictions on investments, royalties and dividends and exchange rate
fluctuations. Approximately


% of sales
in 2007 were from international operations.

Forward-Looking Information

charge through its website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

The following are certain risk
factors that could affect the Registrant’s business, financial condition and
results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection
with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and
conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking
statements. Before you buy the Registrant’s common stock, you should know that
making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described
below. The risks that have been highlighted here are not the only ones that the
Registrant faces.  If any of the risks
actually occur, the Registrant’s business, financial condition or results of
operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of the
Registrant’s securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your
investment.

Damage To The Registrant’s Reputation Or Brand Name Could Negatively
Impact The Registrant.

The Registrant’s reputation for
manufacturing high quality products is widely recognized. In order to safeguard
that reputation, the Registrant has adopted rigorous quality assurance and
quality control procedures which are designed to ensure conformity to
specification and compliance with law. The Registrant also continually makes
efforts to increase its brand awareness and relevance, and to maintain and
improve relationships with its customers and consumers. A serious breach of the
Registrant’s quality assurance or quality control procedures, or deterioration
of its quality image, or impairment of its customer or consumer relationships,
could have a material negative impact on its financial condition and results of
operations.

Issues Regarding Procurement Of Raw Materials May Negatively
Impact The Registrant.

The Registrant’s purchases of
raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability
caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, governmental
actions and other factors beyond the Registrant’s control. The most significant
raw materials are cheese, pepper, soybean oil, wheat, sweeteners, capsicums,
garlic and onion. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain,
the Registrant seeks to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways,
including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for
future delivery and customer price adjustments. The Registrant has not used
derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. Any actions taken in
response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate
the Registrant’s exposure to changes in raw material prices. Therefore, the
Registrant cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations
will not have a negative impact on its business, financial condition or
operating results.

In addition, the Registrant may
have very little opportunity to mitigate the availability risk of certain raw
materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield, political unrest in the
producing countries, changes in governmental agricultural programs and other
factors beyond the Registrant’s control. Therefore, the Registrant cannot
provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a
negative impact on its business, financial condition or operating results.


Further, political,
socio-economic, and cultural conditions, as well as disruptions caused by
terrorist activities, in developing countries create risks for food
safety.  Although the Registrant has adopted rigorous quality assurance
and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of its
imported products, the Registrant cannot provide assurance that such events
will not have a negative impact on its business, financial condition or
operating results.

The Registrant’s
Profitability May Suffer As A Result Of Competition In Its Markets.

The
food industry is intensely competitive. Competition in the Registrant’s product
categories is based on price, product innovation, product quality, brand
recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity
and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. From time to
time, the Registrant may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to
respond to competitive and customer pressures. Such pressures also may impair
the Registrant’s ability to take appropriate remedial action to address
commodity and other cost increases.

The Registrant’s Operations May Be Impaired As A Result Of
Disasters, Business Interruptions Or Similar Events.

A natural disaster such as an
earthquake, fire, flood, or severe storm, or a catastrophic event such as a
terrorist attack, an epidemic affecting the Registrant’s operating activities,
major facilities, or employees’ and customers’ health, or a computer system
failure, could cause an interruption or delay in the Registrant’s business and
loss of inventory and/or data or render the Registrant unable to accept and
fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all.  In addition, some
of the Registrant’s inventory and production facilities are located in areas
that are susceptible to harsh weather; a major storm, heavy snowfall or other
similar event could prevent the Registrant from delivering products in a timely
manner.  The Registrant cannot provide assurance that its disaster
recovery plan will address all of the issues it may encounter in the event of a
disaster or other unanticipated issue, and the Registrant’s business
interruption insurance may not adequately compensate it for losses that may
occur from any of the foregoing.  In the event that an earthquake, natural
disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part
of the Registrant’s facilities or interrupt its operations for any extended
period of time, or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent the Registrant
from delivering products in a timely manner, the Registrant’s business,
financial condition and operating results could be seriously harmed.

The Registrant May Not Be Able To Successfully Consummate Proposed
Acquisitions Or Divestitures Or Integrate Acquired Businesses.

From time to time, the
Registrant may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of its
business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These potential acquisitions
and divestitures may present financial, managerial and operational challenges,
including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty
with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems,
increased expenses, assumption of unknown liabilities, and indemnities and
potential disputes with the buyers or sellers.  In addition, the
Registrant may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges
related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired
businesses which may reduce its profitability. If the Registrant is unable to
consummate these transactions, or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions
and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, its financial
results could be adversely affected.


The Registrant’s Foreign Operations Are Subject To Additional Risks.

The Registrant operates its
business and markets its products internationally. In 2007,


% of the
Registrant’s sales were generated in foreign countries. The Registrant’s
foreign operations are subject to the risks described in this section, as well
as risks related to fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange
controls, discriminatory fiscal policies, compliance with foreign laws,
enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or
political uncertainties. In particular, the Registrant’s subsidiaries conduct
their businesses in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting,
their results are translated into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates
prevailing during a reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S.
dollar, the Registrant’s reported net revenues and operating income will be
reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars.
Additionally, international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of
tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions. All of these
risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which
could adversely affect the Registrant’s profitability.

The Consolidation Of Customers May Put Pressures On The
Registrant’s Operating Margins And Profitability.

The Registrant’s customers, such
as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in
recent years and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the U.S., the
European Union and other major markets. 
Such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and
profitability in that it has produced large, sophisticated customers with
increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced
inventories, resisting price increases, and demanding lower pricing, increased
promotional programs and specifically tailored products. These factors and
others could have an adverse impact on the Registrant’s future sales growth and
profitability.

Fluctuations In Foreign Currency Markets May Negatively Impact The
Registrant.

The Registrant is exposed to
fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows primarily related to raw material
purchases.  Most of this exposure is due
to foreign operations needing to purchase raw materials in U.S. dollars.  The Registrant also is exposed to
fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and
unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these
investments. Additionally, the Registrant is exposed to volatility in the
translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars. Primary exposures
include the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian
dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi and Thai baht. On occasion,
the Registrant may enter into forward and option contracts to manage these
foreign currency risks. However, these contracts may not effectively limit or
eliminate the Registrant’s exposure to a decline in operating results due to
foreign currency exchange changes. Therefore, the Registrant cannot provide
assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative
impact on its business, financial position or operating results.

Increases In Interest Rates May Negatively Impact The Registrant.

The Registrant had total
outstanding short-term borrowings of approximately $

149.2

million at an
average interest rate of approximately

5.28

% on November 30,
2007.  The Registrant’s policy is to
manage its interest costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.  The Registrant also uses interest rate swaps
to achieve a desired proportion of fixed and variable rate debt.  The Registrant utilizes derivative financial
instruments to enhance its ability to manage risk, including interest rate exposures
that exist as part of its ongoing business operations.  The Registrant does not enter into contracts
for trading purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instrument.  The Registrant’s use of


derivative
financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior
management and the utilization of written guidelines.  However, the Registrant’s use of these
instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate its exposure to changes in
interest rates. Therefore, the Registrant cannot provide assurance that future
interest rate increases will not have a material negative impact on its
business, financial position or operating results.

The Pending Acquisition Of
The Assets Of Lawry’s May Pose Risks To The Registrant’s Business.

The Registrant has
entered into an asset purchase agreement with Conopco, Inc. under which
the Registrant agreed to purchase specified assets used in connection with the
manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling of food products under the
Lawry’s and Adolph’s brands, including the “Lawry’s®” and “Adolph’s®” trade
names, trademarks, and service marks, and all associated goodwill. There may be
risks or costs resulting from the Lawry’s acquisition that are not presently
known to the Registrant. Various factors, including regulatory approval, may
delay or prevent us from completing the acquisition and increase the costs
associated with the acquisition. For example, the Registrant has agreed with
Conopco to divest its Season-All® business if the divesture becomes necessary
to obtain clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (“HSR”). The Registrant has
agreed to pay Conopco a $30 million termination fee, subject to certain
limited conditions, in the event that HSR clearance is not obtained.

Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff
Comments

None.

Item 2.  Properties

The
Registrant’s principal executive offices and primary research facilities are
owned and are located in suburban Baltimore, Maryland.

The
following is a list of the Registrant’s principal manufacturing properties, all
of which are owned except for the facilities in Commerce, California and
Melbourne, Australia which are leased:


In addition to distribution
facilities and warehouse space available at its manufacturing facilities, the
Registrant leases regional distribution facilities in Belcamp, Maryland,
Salinas, California, and Dallas, Texas and owns a distribution facility in
Monteux, France.  The Registrant also
owns, leases or contracts other properties used for manufacturing consumer and
industrial products and for sales, warehousing, distribution and administrative
functions.

The Registrant
believes its plants are well maintained and suitable for their intended use.
The Registrant further believes that these plants generally have adequate
capacity and can accommodate seasonal demands, changing product mixes and
additional growth.  Many additions and
improvements have been made to these facilities over the years and the plants’
manufacturing equipment includes equipment of the latest type and technology.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

There are no material pending legal proceedings
in which the Registrant or any of its subsidiaries is a party or in which any
of their property is the subject.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to
a Vote of Security Holders

No matter was submitted to a
vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of Registrant’s fiscal year
2007.
