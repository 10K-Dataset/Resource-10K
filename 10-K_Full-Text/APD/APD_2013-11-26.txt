PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General Description of Business

Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” “Air
Products,” or “registrant”), a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1940, serves energy, electronics, chemicals, metals, and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that
include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, equipment, and services. The Company is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and helium and has built leading positions in growth markets such as refinery
hydrogen, semiconductor materials, natural gas liquefaction, and advanced coatings and adhesives. As used in this report, unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” or
“registrant” include controlled subsidiaries and predecessors of Air Products and its subsidiaries.

Financial Information about Segments

The Company manages its operations, assesses performance, and reports earnings under four business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy. Financial
information concerning the Company’s four business segments appears in Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8, herein.

Narrative Description of Business by Segments

Merchant Gases

Merchant Gases sells atmospheric gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air); process gases such as hydrogen, helium (purchased or refined from crude
helium), and carbon dioxide; specialty gases; temporary gas supply services; and equipment, throughout the world to customers in diversified industries, including metals, glass, electronics, chemical processing, food processing, healthcare, general
manufacturing, and petroleum and natural gas industries.

Merchant Gases supplies the following types of products:

Liquid bulk

—Product is delivered in bulk (in liquid or gaseous form) by tanker or tube trailer and stored,
usually in its liquid state, in equipment designed and installed by the Company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed. Liquid bulk sales are typically governed by three- to five-year contracts.

Packaged gases

—Small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars. The Company operates packaged
gas businesses in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In the United States, the Company’s packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging (principally helium) industries.

Small on-site plants

—Customers receive product through small on-sites (cryogenic or noncryogenic generators), either by
a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the customer.

Electric power is the largest cost component in the
production of atmospheric gases—oxygen, nitrogen, and argon. Natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the Company’s Merchant Gases facilities. The Company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through pricing formulas
and surcharges. Helium is primarily produced as a by-product of natural gas production. We purchase crude helium for purification and resale. During fiscal year 2013, we experienced shortages in helium supply due to industry-wide sourcing
shortfalls. No other significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials during the year.

Merchant Gases competes worldwide against three global industrial gas companies: L’Air Liquide S.A.; Linde AG; and Praxair, Inc.; and several regional sellers (including Airgas, Inc., primarily with respect to
liquid bulk sales). Competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications.

Merchant Gases sales constituted 40% of the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2013, 38% in fiscal year 2012, and 38% in fiscal year 2011. Sales of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and argon)
constituted approximately 19% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2013, 21% in fiscal year 2012, and 21% in fiscal year 2011.

The Company owns a 67.2% controlling interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A., an industrial gas company in South America which produces packaged and liquid bulk gases and sells related hard goods. Indura
S. A. is



accounted for as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment. The Merchant Gases segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the
equity method. The largest of these joint ventures operate in Mexico, Italy, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, India, and Thailand.

Tonnage Gases

Tonnage Gases provides hydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen,
oxygen, and syngas (a hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixture) principally to the energy production and refining, chemical, and metallurgical industries worldwide. Gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by
pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by contracts with 15- to 20-year terms. The Company is the world’s largest provider of hydrogen, which is used by oil refiners to facilitate the conversion
of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels to reduce smog and ozone depletion. The energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification.
The metallurgical industry uses nitrogen for inerting and oxygen for the manufacture of steel and certain nonferrous metals. The chemical industry uses hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many
basic chemicals. The Company delivers product through pipelines from centrally located facilities in or near the United States Gulf Coast; Los Angeles, California; Alberta, Canada; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; United Kingdom; Western Belgium; Ulsan,
Korea; Nanjing, China; Tangshan, China; Kuan Yin, Taiwan; Singapore; and Camaçari, Brazil. The Company also owns less than controlling interests in pipelines located in Thailand and South Africa.

Natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas production. Electric power is the largest cost
component in the production of atmospheric gases. The Company mitigates energy and natural gas price increases through long-term cost pass-through contracts. During fiscal year 2013, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate
supplies of energy or raw materials.

Tonnage Gases competes against three global industrial gas companies: L’Air
Liquide S.A.; Linde AG; Praxair, Inc.; and several regional competitors. Competition is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, the development of applications that use industrial gases, and, in some cases, provision of other services or
products such as power and steam generation. We also have a competitive advantage in regions where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to provide a reliable and economic supply of products to customers.

Tonnage Gases sales constituted approximately 33% of the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2013, 33% in fiscal year
2012, and 34% in fiscal year 2011. Tonnage Gases hydrogen and related product sales constituted approximately 21% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2013, 19% in fiscal year 2012, and 21% in fiscal year 2011.

Electronics and Performance Materials

Electronics and Performance Materials employs applications technology to provide solutions to a broad range of global industries
through chemical synthesis, analytical technology, process engineering, and surface science. This segment provides the electronics industry with specialty gases (such as nitrogen trifluoride, arsine, phosphine, white ammonia, silicon tetrafluoride,
carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoromethane, critical etch gases, and tungsten hexafluoride), tonnage gases (primarily nitrogen), chemicals mechanical planarization slurries, specialty chemicals, services, and equipment primarily for the manufacture of
silicon and compound semiconductors and thin film transistor liquid crystal displays. These products are delivered through various supply chain methods, including bulk delivery systems or distribution by pipelines such as those located in
California’s Silicon Valley; Phoenix, Arizona; Tainan, Taiwan; Gumi and Giheung, Korea; and Tianjin China.

Electronics and Performance Materials also provides performance materials for a wide range of products, including coatings, inks,
adhesives, civil engineering, personal care, institutional and industrial cleaning, mining, oil refining, and polyurethanes, and focuses on the development of new materials aimed at providing unique functionality to emerging markets. Principal
performance materials include polyurethane catalysts and other additives for polyurethane foam, epoxy amine curing agents and auxiliary products for epoxy systems, specialty surfactants for formulated systems, and functional additives for industrial
cleaning and mining industries.

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials,
including ammonia, tungsten powder, hydrogen fluoride, amines, alcohols, epoxides, organic acids, and ketones. During fiscal year 2013, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials.



The Electronics and Performance Materials segment faces competition on a
product-by-product basis against competitors ranging from niche suppliers with a single product to larger and more vertically integrated companies. Competition is principally conducted on the basis of price, quality, product performance, reliability
of product supply, technical innovation, service, and global infrastructure.

Total sales from Electronics and
Performance Materials constituted approximately 22% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2013, 24% in fiscal year 2012, and 24% in fiscal year 2011.

Equipment and Energy

Equipment and Energy designs and manufactures cryogenic
equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas liquefaction (LNG), and helium distribution (cryogenic transportation containers), and serves energy markets in a variety of ways.

Equipment is sold globally to customers in the chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and
steel and primary metals processing industries. The segment also provides a broad range of plant design, engineering, procurement, and construction management services to its customers.

Energy markets are served through the Company’s operation and partial ownership of cogeneration and flue gas desulfurization
facilities. In addition, we are developing hydrogen as an energy carrier, waste-to-energy facilities to produce electricity, carbon capture technologies for a variety of industrial and power applications, and oxygen-based technologies to serve
energy markets in the future. The Company operates and owns a 48.8% interest in a 112-megawatt gas-fueled power generation facility in Thailand. The Company also operates and owns a 70% interest in a flue gas desulfurization facility in Indiana.

Steel, aluminum, and capital equipment subcomponents (compressors, etc.) are the principal raw materials in the
equipment portion of this segment. Adequate raw materials for individual projects are acquired under firm purchase agreements. Limestone is the largest cost component in the production of energy. The Company mitigates these cost components, in part,
through long-term cost pass-through contracts. During fiscal year 2013, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials.

Equipment and Energy competes with a great number of firms for all of its offerings except LNG heat exchangers, for which there are
fewer competitors due to the limited market size and proprietary technologies. Competition is based primarily on technological performance, service, technical know-how, price, and performance guarantees.

The backlog of equipment orders (including letters of intent believed to be firm) from third-party customers was approximately
$402 million on 30 September 2013, approximately 6% of which is for cryogenic equipment and 66% of which is for LNG heat exchangers, as compared with a total backlog of approximately $450 million on 30 September 2012. The Company
expects that approximately $250 million of the backlog on 30 September 2013 will be completed during fiscal year 2014.

Narrative Description of the Company’s Business Generally

The Company,
through subsidiaries, affiliates, and less-than-controlling interests, conducts business in over 50 countries outside the United States. Its international businesses are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls; import and export controls; and other economic, political, and regulatory policies of local governments.

The Company has majority or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in Canada, 18 European countries (including the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Spain), 11 Asian countries (including China, Korea, and Taiwan), 8 Latin American countries (including Chile and Brazil) and 2 African countries. The Company also owns less-than-controlling interests in entities
operating in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America (including Italy, Germany, China, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, and Mexico).

Financial information about the Company’s foreign operations and investments is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial
Information of Equity Affiliates; Note 22, Income Taxes; and Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, herein. Information about foreign currency translation is
included under “Foreign Currency” in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and information on the Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations is included in Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements,
included under Item 8, below, and in “Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk,” included under Item 7A, below. Export sales from operations in the United States to third-party customers amounted to $410.3 million,
$521.1 million, and $537.3 million in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.



Technology Development

The Company pursues a market-oriented approach to technology development through research and development, engineering, and
commercial development processes. It conducts research and development principally in its laboratories located in the United States (Trexlertown, Pennsylvania; Carlsbad, California; Milton, Wisconsin; and Phoenix, Arizona), Canada (Vancouver), the
United Kingdom (Basingstoke and Carrington), Germany (Hamburg), the Netherlands (Utrecht), Spain (Barcelona), Japan (Kawasaki), China (Shanghai), Korea (Giheung), and Taiwan (Chupei and Hsinchu City). The Company also funds and cooperates in
research and development programs conducted by a number of major universities and undertakes research work funded by others—principally the United States government.

The Company’s corporate research groups, which include science and process technology centers, support the research efforts of
various businesses throughout the Company. Development of technology for use within Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, and Equipment and Energy focuses primarily on new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial
gases and new or improved applications for all such products. Research and technology development for Electronics and Performance Materials supports development of new products and applications to strengthen and extend the Company’s present
positions. Work is also performed in Electronics and Performance Materials to lower processing costs and develop new processes for the new products.

Research and development expenditures were $133.7 million during fiscal year 2013, $126.4 million in fiscal year 2012, and $118.8 million in fiscal year 2011. In addition, the Company expended
$45.5 million on customer-sponsored research activities during fiscal year 2013, $45.4 million in fiscal year 2012, and $29.1 million in fiscal year 2011.

As of 1 November 2013, the Company owns 972 United States patents, 3,439 foreign patents, and is a licensee under certain
patents owned by others. While the patents and licenses are considered important, the Company does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent, patent license, or group of patents or licenses.

Environmental Controls

The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From
time to time, the Company is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA: the federal Superfund law), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and similar state and foreign
environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Additional information with respect to these proceedings is included under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, below. The Company’s accounting policy
for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8,
below.

The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled
$37.1 million in fiscal 2013, $44.7 million in 2012, and $34.0 million in 2011. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards.
Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, the Company estimates that we spent $4.0 million in both 2013 and 2012, on
capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately $4.0 million in both 2014 and 2015.

Employees

On 30 September 2013, the Company (including majority-owned subsidiaries) had approximately 21,600 employees, of whom approximately 21,300 were full-time employees and of whom approximately 13,600 were located
outside the United States. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with unions at various locations that expire on various dates over the next four years. The Company considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory.

Available Information

All periodic and current reports, registration statements, and other filings that the Company is required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Company’s annual report on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act Reports), are available free of charge
through



the Company’s Internet website at www.airproducts.com. Such documents are available as soon as reasonably practicable after electronic filing of the material with the SEC. All 1934 Act
Reports filed during the period covered by this report were available on the Company’s website on the same day as filing.

The public may also read and copy any materials filed by the Company with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the
operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy, and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
The address of that site is www.sec.gov.

Seasonality

Although none of the four business segments are subject to seasonal fluctuations to any material extent, the Electronics and
Performance Materials segment is susceptible to the cyclical nature of the electronics industry and to seasonal fluctuations in underlying end-use performance materials markets.

Working Capital

The Company maintains inventory where required to facilitate the supply of products to customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. Merchant Gases inventory consists primarily of industrial, specialty gas, and
crude helium inventories supplied to customers through liquid bulk and packaged gases supply modes. Electronics and Performance Materials inventories consist primarily of bulk and packaged specialty gases and chemicals, bulk and packaged performance
chemical solutions and also include inventories to support sales of equipment and services. Specialty and performance chemical inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Tonnage Gases and Equipment and Energy have limited inventory.

Customers

We do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market, and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. The Tonnage Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments do have
concentrations of customers in specific industries, primarily refining, chemicals, and electronics. Within each of these industries, the Company has several large-volume customers with long-term contracts. A negative trend affecting one of these
industries, or the loss of one of these major customers, although not material to our consolidated revenues, could have an adverse impact on the affected segment.

Governmental Contracts

No segment’s business is subject to a government entity’s renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts that would be material to our business as a whole.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

In conjunction with evaluating an investment in the Company and the
forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time, you should carefully read the following risk factors. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well. While we believe we
have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are
not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.

Overall Economic Conditions—A weakening or reversal of economic recovery in certain markets in which the Company does
business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues, operating results, and cash flow.

Demand for the Company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the Company does business. In the past few years, uncertain
economic conditions in certain geographies and industries served by the Company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the Company’s products and services, in turn negatively impacting the Company’s revenues and earnings.
Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market, affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. Excess capacity in the Company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing
facilities could decrease the Company’s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits. Unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results. Our operating results in one or
more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment.

Operational, Political, and Legal Risks of International Operations—The Company’s foreign operations can be adversely
impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, or political instability. Developing market operations present special risks.

The majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from international operations. In addition, the Company is actively investing
significant capital and other resources in emerging markets. The Company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to project delays due to unanticipated government actions and to nationalization and expropriation risk, and
some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. Economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, social unrest, or strained relations between countries
can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations and financial results.

Our developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including
geopolitical, legal, economic and talent risks. We expect to achieve our long-term financial goals, in part, by achieving disproportionate growth in developing regions. Should growth rates or our market share fall substantially below expected levels
in these regions, our results could be negatively impacted. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage the risks inherent in operating in a developing market, including unfamiliar regulatory environments, new relationships with local
partners, language and cultural differences, and tailoring products for acceptance by local markets.

Interest Rate
Increases—The Company’s earnings, cash flow, and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases and access to credit.

At 30 September 2013, the Company had total consolidated debt of $6,273.6 million, of which $1,617.3 million will mature in the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to incur
indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt. Although the Company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations, not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged, and new debt
will be priced at market rates. If interest rates increase, the Company’s interest expense could increase significantly, affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other
purposes. In addition, changes by any rating agency to the Company’s outlook or credit ratings could increase the Company’s cost of borrowing and weaken our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to
us. For a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk, see Item 7A, below.



New Technologies—New technologies create performance risks that could impact
our financial results or reputation.

A number of new technologies and new product offerings are being developed or
implemented by the Company. Some of our existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs beyond our experience base. These technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. Failure of the
technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses, could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or damage to our reputation.

Raw Material and Energy Cost and Availability—Interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover
increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.

Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. Energy,
including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of the Company’s business. Because the Company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, energy price
fluctuations could materially impact the Company’s revenues and earnings. A disruption in the supply of energy or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, natural events, or other disruption, could
prevent the Company from meeting its contractual commitments, harming its business and financial results.

The
Company’s supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers. Lower natural gas production (which may result from natural gas pricing or supplier operating issues) or
interruptions in sales from other crude helium suppliers, can reduce the Company’s supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to its customers.

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials, including alcohols, ethyleneamines,
cyclohexylamine, acrylonitriles, and glycols. Shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact financial results.

The Company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers, but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results. The Company may not be able to
raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery. Increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the Company’s
revenues and earnings. Even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.

Regulatory
Compliance—The Company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business. Changes in regulations addressing, among other things, environmental compliance, import/export restrictions,
anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact the Company’s operations and financial results.

The Company is subject to government regulation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business.
The application of laws and regulations to the Company’s business is sometimes unclear. Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability.
Determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results. Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs. Export controls or
other regulatory restrictions could prevent the Company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. Export restrictions continue to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement
authorities. Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the Company’s businesses. Increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirements, including the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, could subject the Company to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation occurs. We have internal control policies and procedures to foster
compliance with these laws, including compliance and training programs for our employees; however, the foregoing cannot eliminate the risk that violations could be committed by our employees, agents or joint venture partners.

Greenhouse Gases—Legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk.

Some of the Company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and



mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in Ontario, Canada and South Korea. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new
construction and major modifications to existing facilities.

Increased public concern may result in more international,
U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase the Company’s costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases
production. The Company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through its contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate estimate of the long-term impact on the
Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could impact the Company’s growth, increase its operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of its products.

Environmental Compliance—Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact
the Company’s operations and financial results.

The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and
foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. The Company takes
its environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the
Company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect
financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see “Narrative Description of the Company’s Business Generally—Environmental Controls,” above.

We may not be able to successfully implement initiatives to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce
costs.

Achieving our long-term profitability and return goals depends significantly on our efforts to control or
reduce our operating costs. Because many of our costs are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control, we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency or other initiatives. Such initiatives are
important to our success. If we are not able to identify and complete initiatives designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date, or any future cost-savings
initiatives, do not generate expected cost savings, our financial results could be adversely impacted.

Currency
Fluctuations—Changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the Company’s financial results.

The
majority of the Company’s sales are derived from outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also has significant production facilities that are located outside of the United States. Financial results therefore
will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects, but it is not cost-effective to hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of
changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings, cash flows, and fair values of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange
rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A, below.

Catastrophic
Events—Catastrophic events could disrupt the Company’s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on the Company’s business, financial results, and cash flow.

The Company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the Company’s control, including severe weather
conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and storms, or acts of war and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the Company’s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly
expose it to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact the Company’s suppliers or customers, in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the Company, or its customers may be unable to purchase or
accept the Company’s products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the Company’s operations and financial results.



Operational Risks—Operational and execution risks may adversely affect the
Company’s operations or financial results.

The Company’s operation of its facilities, pipelines, and
delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. If operational risks materialize, they could
result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact the Company’s ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flow. In addition, the Company’s operating results are
dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements. Operating results are also dependent on the Company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget, and in
accordance with performance requirements. Failure to do so may expose the Company to loss of revenue, potential litigation, and loss of business reputation.

Information Security—The security of the Company’s Information Technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect its ability to operate.

We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain
financial accuracy and efficiency. Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and outsourced service providers. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain
the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to our intellectual property through security breach. As with all large
systems, our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. The Company’s systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be
subject to hacking attempts. To date, the Company is not aware of any impact on its operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

The Company’s business
involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about its employees, vendors, and customers. The protection of such information, as well as the Company’s information, is critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding
information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. The Company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information.
The Company also, from time to time, exports sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of
proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers,
or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.

Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings—The Company’s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory
proceedings, including those involving antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.

The Company is subject to
litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. The outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s
expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance
receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in
applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in any particular period. For a more detailed discussion of
the legal proceedings involving the Company, see Item 3, below.

Asset Impairments—The Company may be
required to record impairment on its long-lived assets.

Weak demand may cause underutilization of the Company’s
manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; and contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment. These or
other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market, product, or customer events may require the Company to record



an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on its financial results.

Competition—Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial
performance.

The Company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional
ones in many of its business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the Company’s products, negatively impacting financial results. In
addition, competitors’ pricing policies could materially affect the Company’s profitability or its market share.

Pension Liabilities—The Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by its
pension plans.

Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact
on the value of the Company’s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities, significantly affecting the net periodic benefit costs of its pension plans and ongoing funding requirements for these plans. As a result, the
Company’s financial results and cash flow in any period could be negatively impacted. For information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters, see the discussion in Note 16,
Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8, below.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We have not received any written comments from the Commission staff
that remain unresolved.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

Air Products owns its principal administrative offices, which are our
headquarters in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania and administrative offices in Hersham, U.K. and Santiago, Chile. The Company leases administrative offices in Ontario, Canada; Crewe, U.K.; Brussels, Belgium; Paris, France; Barcelona and Madrid, Spain;
Rotterdam and Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Bochum, Germany; Moscow, Russia; Warsaw, Poland; São Paulo, Brazil; Shanghai, Beijing and Xi’an, China; Taipei, Taiwan; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Kawasaki, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; and Singapore.

The following is a description of the properties used by our four business segments. We believe that, in general, our
facilities are suitable and adequate for our current and anticipated future levels of operation and are adequately maintained.

Merchant Gases

Merchant Gases currently operates 300
production and distribution facilities in North and South America (98 are located on owned property), 152 facilities in Europe and Middle East and Africa (50 are on owned property), and 87 facilities within Asia (11 are on owned property). The
production and distribution facilities include approximately 30 integrated sites that primarily serve the Tonnage Gases or Electronics businesses. These assets are also included in information provided for those businesses. We added 12 liquid
CO


locations with the acquisition of EPCO Carbon Dioxide Products, Inc. in May
of this year. Helium is processed at sites in Kansas and Texas and then distributed to/from transfill sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. Sales support offices are located at our global office centers above, at 9 leased properties in the
U.S. and Canada, at 9 leased sites and at production plant sites in Europe, at 10 leased sites and at production plant sites in Asia and at regional production plant sites in South America.

Research and development (R&D) activities for this segment are conducted in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania; Basingstoke and
Carrington in the U.K.; a leased site in British Columbia, Canada; and a leased site in Shanghai, China.

Tonnage
Gases

Tonnage Gases operates over 65 plants (9 are located on owned property) in North and South America that
produce over 300 standard tons per day of product. Over 40 of these facilities produce or recover hydrogen. Many of the hydrogen facilities support the major pipeline systems located in Los Angeles, California and Alberta, Canada; and along the
United States Gulf Coast through the Gulf Coast Connection Pipeline, which interconnects Texas and Louisiana pipeline networks. The segment also operates 30 tonnage plants in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa and 26 tonnage plants within Asia. The
majority of the sites in this segment are under structured long-term leasehold type agreements. Sales support offices are located at our headquarters in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania and leased



offices in Texas, Louisiana, California, and Calgary, Alberta in North America as well as in Hersham, U.K.; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Moscow, Russia; Shanghai, China; Singapore; Bahrain; and
Doha, Qatar.

Electronics and Performance Materials

The Electronics business within this segment produces, packages, and stores nitrogen, specialty gases, and electronic chemicals, and
manufactures equipment at 40 sites in the United States (9 of which are owned and the majority of the remaining are located on customer sites), nine leased facilities in Europe and the Middle East, and 55 facilities in Asia (13 of which are owned,
28 of which are located on customer sites and the remainder are leased or term grants).

The Performance Materials
division within this segment operates 5 production facilities in the United States, 3 in Europe and 4 in Asia. Seven of the Performance Materials facility sites are owned.

The segment conducts R&D related activities at 11 locations worldwide, including Trexlertown, Pennsylvania; Carlsbad,
California; Tempe, Arizona; Utrecht, the Netherlands; at 3 sites in Germany; Chubei and Hsin Chu, Taiwan; Shanghai, China; and Kawasaki, Japan.

Equipment and Energy

The Equipment division operates at eight facilities in
the U.S., one in Europe and three in Asia. We manufacture a significant portion of the world’s supply of LNG equipment at our Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, site. In early 2014, the Company expects to open its new LNG manufacturing facility at the
Port of Manatee, Florida. Air separation columns and cold boxes for Company-owned facilities and third-party sales are produced by operations in Caojing, China and Tanjung Langsat, Malaysia as well as in the Wilkes-Barre facility. Cryogenic
transportation containers for liquid helium are manufactured and reconstructed at facilities in eastern Pennsylvania; Liberal, Kansas; and Istres, France. Equipment commercial and engineering team members are located at offices in Trexlertown and
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Hersham, U.K.; Pune, India; and Shanghai, China.

The Energy division produces electric power at
various facilities globally, including a gas-fueled power generation facility in Thailand, in which the Company has a 48.8% interest. Flue gas desulfurization operations are conducted at the Pure Air facility in Chesterton, Indiana. The Company is
constructing a 50MW renewable energy facility in Tees Valley, U.K. with the expected start-up in 2014 and has announced plans to build a second renewable energy facility on an adjacent site. Energy commercial and engineering team members are located
at Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, Hersham and Tees Valley, U.K.

The Company or its affiliates own approximately 33% of the
real estate in this segment and lease the remaining locations.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries
are involved in various legal proceedings, including contract, product liability, intellectual property, and insurance matters. Although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business, such
litigation could result in large monetary awards, especially if a civil jury is allowed to determine compensatory and/or punitive damages. However, we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any
material adverse effect on our financial position, earnings, or cash flows.

From time to time, we are also involved in
proceedings, investigations, and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental, health, safety, competition, and tax matters.

The Company is a party to proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar
state environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there are approximately 33 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the Company, along with others, has been
designated a Potentially Responsible Party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of its current or former manufacturing sites. We do not expect that any
sums we may have to pay in connection with these matters would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Additional information on the Company’s environmental exposure is included under “Narrative Description
of the Company’s Business Generally—Environmental Controls.”



In September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE)
issued a decision against our Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $81 million at
30 September 2013) on Air Products Brasil Ltda. This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice whose investigation began in 2003, alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of
industrial and medical gases. The fines are based on a percentage of the Company’s total revenue in Brazil in 2003.

We have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 to the Brazilian courts. Certain of the
Company’s defenses, if successful, could result in the matter being dismissed with no fine against us. The Company, with advice of its outside legal counsel, has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that, although an adverse
final judgment after exhausting all appeals is reasonably possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements.

While we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these or any other legal proceeding would have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or net cash flows, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and the accompanying notes contained in this report. All comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated. All amounts presented are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
except as noted. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for share data, unless otherwise indicated.

Items such as income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products, net income attributable to Air Products, and
diluted earnings per share attributable to Air Products are simply referred to as “income from continuing operations,” “net income,” and “diluted earnings per share” throughout this Management’s Discussion and
Analysis, unless otherwise stated.

The discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial
measures. For 2013, the

non-GAAP

measures exclude the fourth quarter business restructuring and cost reduction plan and advisory costs. For 2012, the non-GAAP measures exclude the 2012 business restructuring
and cost reduction plans (the photovoltaic (PV) market actions charge, the polyurethane intermediates (PUI) business actions charge, and the cost reduction plan charge), the customer bankruptcy charge, the gain on the previously held equity interest
in DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials LLC (DA NanoMaterials), the Spanish tax settlement, and the Spanish tax ruling. For 2011, the non-GAAP measures exclude the net loss on Airgas transaction. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to
enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis. The reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures is presented on
pages 29–31. Descriptions of the excluded items appear on pages 22–24.



BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries serve energy, electronics, chemicals, metals, and manufacturing customers
globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric, process and specialty gases; performance materials; equipment; and technology. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 50 countries, in 2013 we
had sales of $10.2 billion, assets of $17.9 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 21,600 employees.

We organize our operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance
Materials, and Equipment and Energy. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.

2013 IN SUMMARY

In 2013, we achieved both sales and earnings growth. Our results did fall short of the expectations we set at the beginning of the
year as a result of slower than expected global economic growth. Global manufacturing grew approximately 2% for the year and limited the opportunities for growth, particularly in our Europe and Asia Merchant Gases and Electronics businesses.
Overall, sales increased by 6% resulting from acquisitions and higher energy cost pass-through. Our underlying sales were 1% higher on strength in our Tonnage Gases businesses, higher Performance Materials volumes, and LNG equipment activity
partially offset by weakness in our Electronics equipment area. The impact from winding down our PUI business decreased underlying sales by 2%. Our operating income and diluted earnings per share both increased 2% versus the prior year.

While the difficult global economic environment persisted, we took actions to offset this weakness and to improve results in the
future. We delivered significant cost savings from the 2012 European focused reorganization and committed to additional actions aimed at reducing costs through product exits and asset rationalizations, as well as organizational improvements. The
additional actions are focused on improving our Electronics business, restructuring our global operations function, and further optimizing our cost structure in Europe. Finally, we remain on track to exit our PUI business in fiscal year 2014 as we
continue to manage our business portfolio.

Highlights for 2013

•

Sales of $10,180.4 increased 6%, or $568.7, as acquisitions and higher energy contractual cost pass-through to customers were partially offset by lower volumes
from our previously announced decision to exit the PUI business.

•

Operating income of $1,324.4 increased 3%, or $42.0. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,566.1 increased 2%, or $32.4, with acquisitions and favorable
volume mix partially offset by higher energy and distribution costs and higher operating costs, including pensions.

•

Income from continuing operations of $1,004.2 increased 1%, or $5.0, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.73 increased 2%, or $.07. On
a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,168.5 increased 1%, or $9.9, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.50 increased 2%, or $.10. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share, including a
non-GAAP reconciliation, is presented below.

•

Capital spending was $1,747.8 for the year ended 30 September 2013. On a non-GAAP basis, capital spending of $1,996.7 decreased 28%, primarily from the
prior year acquisition of Indura S.A.

•

We purchased 5.7 million of our outstanding shares at a cost of $461.6.

•

We increased our quarterly dividend by 11% from $.64 to $.71 per share. This represents the 31st consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment.

For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which
management is focused, refer to our 2014 Outlook discussions provided on pages 20 and 21 in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis that follows.



Changes in Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to Air Products

2014 OUTLOOK

Our 2014 outlook for global economic growth is modest, with a range from 2%–4%. We expect that the U.S. will grow 2%–4% as
it continues to face unresolved fiscal challenges, weak job growth, low consumer confidence, and lower global demand. We are hopeful that an economic recovery will begin in Europe with growth of 0%–2%. In Asia, we expect a gradual acceleration
in growth, particularly in China, of 5%–7%. In South America, we expect growth of 1%–3%, which is largely dependent on global demand driving exports.

We anticipate higher earnings in 2014 from new plant onstreams, higher LNG activity, and volume loading on existing assets, recognizing that the last factor will be most influenced by the economy. Pension expense
should be lower as a result of higher interest rates. These positive impacts will be partially offset by higher maintenance expense and more shares outstanding. We also expect lower earnings from the shutdown of our PUI business. The cost reduction
actions implemented in 2012 and 2013 should provide benefits in 2014 and beyond.

Outlook by Segment

•

In Merchant Gases, volume growth will continue to be influenced by the economy. We have available capacity in each region and expect that an improving economy
will increase loading on these assets and drive growth. We expect each region of the business to benefit from the 2013 cost reduction actions.

•

Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from new plant onstreams supported by long-term take-or-pay contracts. However, we also expect higher planned plant
maintenance costs from scheduled customer outages and the unfavorable impact of our exit from the PUI business.



•

We expect that Electronics growth will begin to rebound in 2014 following a weak 2012 and 2013. Overall, we expect silicon growth of 3%–5% in 2014.
Additionally, we expect the business to benefit from the 2013 cost reduction actions and product line restructuring. For Performance Materials, we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter of 2014, with volume growth improving due to a
better economy.

•

Equipment and Energy results are expected to improve due to continued higher activity in our LNG equipment business.

The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section
entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Discussion of Consolidated Results

2013 vs. 2012

Sales of $10,180.4 increased 6%, or $568.7. Underlying business decreased 1%, primarily due to lower volumes resulting from our
previous decision to exit the PUI business and lower Electronics demand, partially offset by higher volumes in the Tonnage Gases, Performance Materials, and Equipment businesses. The acquisitions of Indura S.A. and DA NanoMaterials increased sales
by 5%. Higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 2%.

2012 vs. 2011

Sales of $9,611.7 decreased 1%, or $62.0. Underlying business increased 1%, primarily due to higher volumes in our
Tonnage Gases segment, which were partially offset by lower volumes in the Merchant Gases segment, particularly in Europe. Acquisitions increased sales by 2%. Lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers and currency both
decreased sales by 2%.

Operating Income

2013 vs. 2012

Operating income of $1,324.4 increased 3%, or $42.0. Current year operating income included a charge of $231.6 for a business restructuring and cost reduction plan and $10.1 for advisory costs. Prior year operating
income included a charge of $327.4 for business restructuring and cost reduction plans, a $9.8 charge for a customer bankruptcy, and the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income
of $1,566.1 increased 2%, or $32.4. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions of $54, higher volumes of $24, and favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts of $2, partially offset by $40 from unfavorable higher energy and
distribution costs net of pricing, and higher operating costs of $20, including the impact from pensions. Operating income increased by $12 from higher gains on the sale of assets and investments.



2012 vs. 2011

Operating income of $1,282.4 decreased 15%, or $225.7. Operating income in 2012 includes a charge of $327.4 for business
restructuring and cost reduction plans, a $9.8 charge for a customer bankruptcy, and the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9. Operating income in 2011 includes a $48.5 net loss related to the Airgas transaction.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,533.7 decreased 1%, or $22.9. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable volumes, including acquisitions, of $39 and unfavorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts of $30, partially
offset by lower costs of $31 and higher recovery of raw material costs in pricing of $15. The decrease in volumes was primarily from lower Merchant Gases volumes and unfavorable volume mix due to lower LNG plant sales.

Equity Affiliates’ Income

2013 vs. 2012

Income from equity affiliates of $167.8 increased $14.0,
primarily due to better performance in our Mexican equity affiliate.

2012 vs. 2011

Income from equity affiliates of $153.8 decreased $.5.

Selling and Administrative Expense

2013 vs. 2012

Selling and administrative expense of $1,066.3 increased $119.5,
or 13%, primarily due to the acquisition of Indura S.A. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales increased to 10.5% from 9.9%, also due to Indura S.A.

2012 vs. 2011

Selling and administrative expense of $946.8 increased $5.1, or 1%, primarily due to acquisitions and inflation, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and favorable currency. Selling and
administrative expense as a percent of sales increased to 9.9% from 9.7%.

Research and Development

2013 vs. 2012

Research and development expense of $133.7 increased 6%, or $7.3, primarily due to inflation and the acquisition of DA NanoMaterials. Research and development expense as a percent of sales was 1.3% in 2013 and
2012.

2012 vs. 2011

Research and development expense of $126.4 increased 6%, or $7.6, primarily due to the DA NanoMaterials acquisition. Research and development expense as a percent of sales increased to 1.3% from 1.2%.

Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans

We recorded charges in 2013 and 2012 for business restructuring and cost reduction plans. The charges for these plans are reflected
on the consolidated income statements as “Business restructuring and cost reduction plans.” The charges for these plans are excluded from segment operating income.

2013 Plan

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an expense of $231.6 ($157.9 after-tax, or $.74 per share) reflecting actions to better align our cost structure with current market conditions. These charges include
$100.4 for asset actions and $58.5 for the final settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract primarily impacting the Electronics business due to continued weakness in the PV and light-emitting diode (LED) markets. In addition, $71.9 was
recorded for severance, benefits, and other contractual obligations associated with the elimination of approximately 700 positions and executive changes. These charges primarily impact our Merchant Gases businesses and corporate functions. The
actions are in response to weaker than expected business conditions in Europe and Asia, reorganization of our operations and functional areas, and previously announced senior executive changes. The planned actions are expected to be completed by the
end of fiscal year 2014. We expect $45 in savings in 2014. Beyond 2014, we expect these actions to provide approximately $75 in annual savings.

2012 Plans

In 2012, we recorded an expense of $327.4 ($222.4 after-tax, or
$1.03 per share) for business restructuring and cost reduction plans in our PUI, Electronics, and European Merchant businesses.

During the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an expense of $86.8 ($60.6 after-tax, or $.28 per share) for actions to remove stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the Homecare business, the
reorganization of the



Merchant business, and actions taken to right size our European cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook. The planned actions are complete and provided approximately $60 in
annual savings in 2013.

During the fourth quarter of 2012, we took actions in the PUI business to improve costs,
resulting in a net expense of $54.6 ($34.8 after-tax, or $.16 per share), and ultimately exit the business. Our PUI facility in Pasadena, Texas, is currently being dismantled, with completion expected in fiscal year 2014. The costs to dismantle are
expensed as incurred and are reflected in continuing operations in the Tonnage Gases business segment.

During the fourth
quarter of 2012, we completed an assessment of our position in the PV market, resulting in $186.0 of expense ($127.0 after-tax, or $.59 per share) primarily related to the Electronics and Performance Materials business segment. Included in the
charge was an accrual of $93.5 for an offer that we made to terminate a long-term take-or-pay supply contract to purchase silane. As noted above, a final settlement was reached with the supplier in the fourth quarter of 2013.

Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on
these actions.

Business Combinations

2013 Business Combinations

We completed three acquisitions in 2013. The acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations, and their results of operations were consolidated within their respective segments after the acquisition dates.
The aggregate purchase price, net of cash acquired, for these acquisitions was $233 and resulted in recognition of $68 of goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes.

On 30 August 2013, we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in Guiyang, China.
This acquisition included a long-term sale of gas contract within our Tonnage Gases segment and provided our Merchant Gases segment with additional liquid capacity in the region. On 31 May 2013, we acquired EPCO Carbondioxide Products, Inc.
(EPCO), the largest independent U.S. producer of liquid carbon dioxide (CO


).
This acquisition expanded our North American offerings of bulk industrial process gases in the Merchant Gases business segment. On 1 April 2013, we acquired Wuxi Chem-Gas Company, Ltd. (WCG). This acquisition provided our Merchant Gases segment
with additional gases presence in the Jiangsu Province of China.

2012 Business Combinations

Indura S.A.

In July 2012, we acquired a 64.8% controlling equity interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A. Following the acquisition date, 100% of the Indura S.A. results are consolidated in our financial statements
within the Merchant Gases business segment. The portion of the business that is not owned by the Company is recorded as noncontrolling interests. We paid cash consideration in Chilean pesos (CLP) of 345.5 billion ($690) and assumed debt of CLP113.8
billion ($227) for these interests. As of 30 September 2013, we hold a 67.2% interest.

Refer to Note 5, Business
Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this transaction.

DA NanoMaterials
LLC

On 2 April 2012, we closed on the acquisition agreement with E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. to
acquire their 50% interest in our joint venture, DA NanoMaterials. Beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the results of DA NanoMaterials were consolidated within our Electronics and Performance Materials business segment.

Prior to the acquisition date, we accounted for our 50% interest in DA NanoMaterials as an equity-method investment. The year ended
30 September 2012 included a gain of $85.9 ($54.6 after-tax, or $.25 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair market value as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, to the
consolidated financial statements for additional details on this transaction.

Net Loss on Airgas Transaction

For the year ended 30 September 2011, $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share) in net loss was recognized
related to the Airgas transaction. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.

Customer Bankruptcy

As a result of events which occurred during the fourth
quarter of 2012, we recognized a charge of $9.8 ($6.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) primarily related to the write-off of on-site assets due to a customer bankruptcy and mill



shutdown. The customer, which primarily received products from the Tonnage Gases segment, filed for bankruptcy in May 2012 and announced the mill shutdown in August 2012.

Pension Settlement Loss

Our U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the retirement date. Pension settlements are recognized when
cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. The participant’s vested benefit is considered fully settled upon cash payment of the lump sum. We recognized
$12.4 of settlement charges in 2013.

Advisory Costs

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we incurred legal and other advisory fees of $10.1 ($6.4 after-tax, or $.03 per share) in
connection with our response to the rapid acquisition of a large position in shares of our common stock by Pershing Square Capital Management LLC and its affiliates (Pershing Square). These fees, which are reflected on the consolidated income
statements as “Advisory costs,” include costs incurred before and after Pershing Square’s disclosure of its holdings and cover advisory services related to the adoption of the Shareholders Rights Plan, preparation for a potential
proxy solicitation campaign, and entering into an agreement with Pershing Square.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Items recorded to other income (expense), net arise from transactions and events not directly related to our
principal income earning activities. The detail of other income (expense), net is presented in Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements.

2013 vs. 2012

Other income (expense), net of $70.2 increased $23.1, primarily due to higher gains from the sale of a number of small assets and investments and a favorable commercial contract settlement, partially offset by
lower government grants. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year.

2012 vs.

Other income (expense), net of $47.1 increased $5.4, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange and
reimbursements from government grants for expense, partially offset by lower gains from the sale of assets. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year.

Interest Expense

$141.8

$123.7

$115.5

2013 vs. 2012

Interest incurred increased $13.7. The increase was driven primarily by a higher average debt balance for $41, partially offset by a
lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio of $24. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in project spending and a lower average interest rate.

2012 vs. 2011

Interest incurred increased $15.7. The increase was driven primarily by a higher average debt balance and debt issuance costs related to the Indura S.A. acquisition, partially offset by the impact of a stronger
dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest. The change in capitalized interest was driven by an increase in project spending which qualified for capitalization.

Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors
affecting the effective tax rate.

2013 vs. 2012

On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 22.8% and 21.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The current year rate includes income
tax benefits of $73.7 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans and $3.7 for the advisory costs. The prior year rate includes income tax benefits of $105.0 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans, $58.3
related to the second quarter Spanish tax ruling, and $3.7 related to the customer



bankruptcy charge, offset by income tax expense of $43.8 related to the first quarter Spanish tax settlement and $31.3 related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA
NanoMaterials. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans; Note 5, Business Combinations; Note 22, Income Taxes; and Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for details on these transactions.

benefits of $105.0 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans, $58.3 related to the second quarter Spanish tax ruling, and $3.7 related to the customer bankruptcy charge, offset by income tax expense of $43.8 related to the first
quarter Spanish tax settlement and $31.3 related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans; Note 5, Business Combinations; Note 22, Income Taxes; and Note
23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for details on these transactions. The tax rate in 2011 includes an income tax benefit of $16.9 related to the Airgas transaction. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the
consolidated financial statements for details on this transaction. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% and 24.6% in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Discontinued Operations

During the second quarter of 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which had previously been reported as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment.

On 30 April 2012, we sold the majority of our Homecare business to The Linde Group for sale proceeds of

€

590 million ($777) and recognized a gain of $207.4 ($150.3 after-tax, or $.70 per share). During the third quarter of 2012, an impairment
charge of $33.5 ($29.5 after-tax, or $.14 per share) was recorded to write down the remaining business, which is primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland, to its estimated net realizable value. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an
additional charge of $18.7 ($13.6 after-tax, or $.06 per share) to update our estimate of the net realizable value as we continue to market the business for sale.

Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this business.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The discussion of our annual results includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of
non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by removing certain items which management does not believe to be indicative of on-going business trends and allow evaluation of our baseline performance on a
comparable basis. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures. Presented below are reconciliations of the reported GAAP results to the
non-GAAP measures.

Operating margin is calculated by dividing operating income by sales.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We maintained a strong financial position throughout 2013. We continue to have consistent access to commercial paper
markets, and cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.

As of 30 September 2013, we had $438.3 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $450.4. If the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the U.S. or we
otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently
reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the U.S. Current financing alternatives do not require the repatriation of foreign funds.

Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities of continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:

Operating Activities

For the year ended 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $1,553.1. Income from continuing operations of $1,004.2 reflected
the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $100.4. Income from continuing operations is adjusted for other non-cash items that include depreciation and amortization, undistributed earnings of equity affiliates,
share-based compensation expense, and noncurrent capital lease receivables. The Other adjustments included a use of cash of $300.8 for pension contributions, partially offset by $178.2 of pension and other postretirement expense. The working capital
accounts were a use of cash of $207.8. The reduction of accrued liabilities of $130.3 includes $185.8 for payments made in relation to the prior year cost reduction and



business restructuring actions, including the settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract. The current year payments were partially offset by a $69.7 net increase to accrued liabilities
for the current year cost reduction and business restructuring actions.

For the year ended 2012, cash provided by
operating activities was $1,765.1. Income from continuing operations of $999.2 reflected the non-cash gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9, the write-down of long-lived assets associated with restructuring and a
customer bankruptcy of $80.2, and a non-cash tax benefit of $58.3 recognized as a result of the second quarter Spanish tax ruling. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $100.1. The provision for the cost reduction and business
restructuring plans resulted in an increase to accrued liabilities of $223.9, partially offset by a use of cash of $32.9 for payments made in relation to these plans.

For the year ended 2011, cash provided by operating activities was $1,710.4. Income from continuing operations of $1,134.3 reflected
the non-cash net loss of $48.5 related to the Airgas transaction. We also made cash payments of $156.2 related to the Airgas transaction. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $114.6, including $107.5 for an increase in inventory
primarily to support growth in our Performance Materials business.

Investing Activities

For the year ended 30 September 2013, cash used for investing activities was $1,697.0, primarily driven by capital expenditures
for plant and equipment and acquisitions. For the year ended 30 September 2012, cash used for investing activities was $2,435.2, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment, acquisitions, and investments in unconsolidated
affiliates. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section below for additional detail.

For the year ended 30 September
2011, cash used for investing activities was $1,169.8, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment. We received proceeds of $94.7 from the sale of approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock. Refer to Note 6, Airgas
Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction.

Capital
Expenditures

Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table:

(A)

We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and
purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash
provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the
statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.

Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2013 totaled $1,747.8,
compared to $2,559.8 in 2012, resulting in a decrease of $812.0, primarily due to the acquisition of Indura S.A. in 2012. Additions to plant and equipment are largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses. Additions to plant
and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Spending in 2013 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen for coal gasification
in China, hydrogen to the global market, and renewable energy in the U.K.

In 2013, we completed
three acquisitions with an aggregate cash use, net of cash acquired, of $224.9. In the fourth quarter, we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in Guiyang, China. During the third quarter, we acquired EPCO, the largest
independent U.S. producer of liquid carbon dioxide (CO


), and WCG.

In 2012, we acquired a controlling stake in Indura S.A. for $690 and E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc.’s 50% interest in our
joint venture, DA NanoMaterials for $147. We also purchased a 25% equity interest in Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co. Ltd. (AHG), an unconsolidated affiliate, for $155 in the third quarter.



Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, and Note 8, Summarized Financial Information
of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisitions and the investment in AHG.

Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2013 totaled $1,996.7 compared to $2,778.3 in 2012. Capital lease expenditures of $234.9 increased by $22.7, reflecting higher project spending.

2014 Outlook

Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2014 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,800 and $1,900, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,900 and $2,100.
The non-GAAP capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases, which are expected to be between $100 and $200. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with approximately
$1,000 expected for new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity
affiliates.

Financing Activities

For the year ended 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $115.4. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of
repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $927.4 and included $437.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and the issuances of a

€

300 million ($397) 2.0% Eurobond on 7 August 2013, and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 2.75% note on 4 February 2013, which were partially offset by the repayment of a $300.0 senior fixed-rate
4.15% note on 1 February 2013. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash of $226.4. The primary uses of cash were to purchase 5.7 million shares of treasury stock for $461.6 and to pay dividends of $565.6.

repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $457.0 and included $234.3 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances as well as a $350.0 senior fixed-rate 2.0% note, which were partially offset by $156.0 in U.S. medium-term
note maturities. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $148.2 source of funds. Dividends paid to shareholders and the purchase of 7.4 million treasury shares were uses of cash of $456.7 and $649.2, respectively.

Discontinued Operations

For the year ended 2013, cash provided by discontinued operations was $13.1. For the year ended 2012, the sale of our European Homecare business to The Linde Group generated proceeds of $776.6 and is included in
discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Financing and Capital Structure

Capital needs in 2013 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations and the issuance of debt. At the end of 2013, total debt outstanding was $6,273.6 compared to $5,291.9 at the end of 2012, and cash and cash
items were $450.4 compared to $454.4 at the end of 2012. Total debt at 30 September 2013 and 2012, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest) was 45.3% and
43.0%, respectively.

Proceeds from long-term debt were $927.2. This included the issuance of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate
2.75% note on 4 February 2013 that matures on 3 February 2023, and a

€

300 million ($397) 2.0% Eurobond was issued on
7 August 2013 that matures on 7 August 2020; both were issued for general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

On 30 April 2013, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “2013
Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The 2013 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity for the Company and supports its commercial paper program. We
entered into this agreement to increase the previously existing facility by $330.0, extend the maturity date to 30 April 2018, and modify the financial covenant. The Company’s only financial covenant is a



maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization of 70%. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2013.

The 2013 Credit Agreement terminates and replaces the Company’s $2,170.0 revolving credit agreement dated 8 July 2010, as
subsequently amended, which was to mature 30 June 2015 and had a financial covenant of long-term debt divided by the sum of long-term debt plus equity of no greater than 60%. No borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement at the
time of its termination, and no early termination penalties were incurred.

Effective 11 June 2012, we entered into
an offshore Chinese Renminbi (RMB) syndicated credit facility of RMB1,000.0 million ($163.5), maturing in June 2015. There are RMB250.0 million ($40.9) in outstanding borrowings under this commitment at 30 September 2013. Additional
commitments totaling $383.0 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $309.0 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2013.

An acquisition financing facility was arranged with Banco Santander, Chile to provide the initial financing required for the Indura S.A. business combination. This was a Chilean Peso (CLP) committed credit facility
with a total commitment amount of CLP390 billion ($778). Of this facility, CLP347 billion ($693) was drawn on 3 July 2012 to fund the business combination and related expenses, and the balance of the commitment was cancelled. This facility was
fully repaid on 2 August 2012, primarily with proceeds from U.S. commercial paper issuance. A portion of this commercial paper was subsequently refinanced with the $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note issued on 13 September 2012 that matures
on 15 October 2017.

As of 30 September 2013, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other
covenants under our debt agreements.

As of 30 September 2013, we classified $400.0 of commercial paper as long-term
debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under our $2,500.0 committed credit facility maturing in 2018. Our current intent is to refinance this debt via the U.S. public or private placement markets.

On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. During
fiscal year 2013, 5.7 million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of $461.6. At 30 September 2013, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains.

2014 Outlook

Cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We project a modest need to access the long-term debt markets in 2014, primarily to refinance
commercial paper. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. Also, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets.

Dividends

On 21 March 2013, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.64 per share to $.71 per share. Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week
after the close of the fiscal quarter.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase
obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 September 2013:



Long-Term Debt Obligations

The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related
contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt.

Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current
interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $1,454 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2013, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for
the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2013. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates.

Leases

Refer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases.

Pension Obligations

The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated
financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment.

The
total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the
liability and related contributions.

Unconditional Purchase Obligations

Approximately $700 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen,
carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply
obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on
our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations.

The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas
supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $625 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in
2014.

We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of
business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. In total, we purchase approximately
$7.7 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above.

Income Tax Liabilities

Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2013 were $827.2. Tax liabilities related to
unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2013 were $124.3. These tax liabilities were excluded from the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to
changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. In addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the
consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Discontinued Operations

Payables and accrued liabilities as of 30 September 2013 include $148 for the contingent proceeds related to the sale of
our Homecare business. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.



Put Options

We currently have outstanding put option agreements with other shareholders of our Air Products San Fu Company, Ltd. and Indura S.A.
subsidiaries. The put options give the shareholders the right to sell stock in the subsidiaries based on pricing terms in the agreements. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional
information. Due to the uncertainty of whether these options would be exercised and the related timing, we excluded the potential payments from the Contractual Obligations table.

PENSION BENEFITS

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit
pension plans—the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. Over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to
reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.

For 2013, the fair market value of pension plan assets for our
defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $3,800.8 from $3,239.1 in 2012. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $4,394.0 and $4,486.5 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Refer to Note 16,
Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits.

Pension Expense

2013 vs. 2012

The increase in pension expense, excluding special items, was primarily attributable to the 100 bp decrease in weighted average
discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and contributions in 2013. Special items of $19.8 primarily included $12.4 for pension settlement
losses and $6.9 for special termination benefits relating to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan.

2012 vs. 2011

Pension expense in 2012, excluding special items, was comparable to 2011 expense as a result of no change in the weighted average discount rate from year to year.

2014 Outlook

Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $140 to $145, excluding special items, in 2014, a decrease of $5 to $10 from 2013, resulting primarily from an increase in discount rates, partially offset by
unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality and inflation assumptions. Pension settlement losses of $10 to $25 are expected, dependent on the timing of retirements. In 2014, pension expense will include approximately $118 for
amortization of actuarial losses compared to $143 in 2013. Net actuarial gains of $370.4 were recognized in 2013, resulting primarily from an approximately 65 bp increase in the weighted average discount rate as well as actual asset returns above
expected returns. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from
expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2014.

Pension
Funding

Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which
are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.

In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax
deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2013 and 2012, our cash contributions to
funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $300.8 and $76.4, respectively. Contributions for 2013 include voluntary contributions for U.S. plans of $220.0.



For 2014, cash contributions to defined benefit plans, including benefit payments for
unfunded plans, are estimated to be $80 to $100. Contributions to unfunded plans are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan
design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 34 for a projection of future contributions.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to various
environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in proceedings under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA: the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites
for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17,
Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.

The amounts charged to income from continuing
operations related to environmental matters totaled $37.1, $44.7, and $34.0 in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal
Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $4 in both 2013 and 2012 on capital projects to
control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $4 in both 2014 and 2015.

We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for
such costs is estimated to range from $86 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $100. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2013 and 2012 included an accrual of $86.7 and $87.5, respectively. The accrual for the environmental
obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; Paulsboro, New Jersey; and Pasadena, Texas, locations is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for
further details on these facilities.

Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the
estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess
of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year.

Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union
Emissions Trading Scheme and California’s cap and trade scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in Ontario, Canada, and
South Korea. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. At the U.S. state level, California’s cap and trade program rules have been
officially adopted, and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer began 1 January 2013. We have been able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms.

Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or
mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the
potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. Any legislation that limits or
taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products.

Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are
also



developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate
fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated
financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results
of operations, or liquidity.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. We did not engage in any
material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties.

INFLATION

We operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and
competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and
estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to
make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and
estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee.

Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment

Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2013 totaled $8,974.0, and depreciation expense totaled $864.7 during 2013. Plant
and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.

Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its
physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material
availability, and geographic location.

The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its
appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally
anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the
adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.

We have numerous long-term
customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply contracts associated
with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Additionally, we have several customer supply contracts within the Equipment and Energy
segment with contract terms that are primarily 5 to 10 years. The depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts
are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets
is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset.



The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are
principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment,
where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances,
potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change.

A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance
Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below:

Impairment of Assets

Plant and Equipment

Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the
asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.

If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is
compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the
asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review.
Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.
We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.

Goodwill

The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible
and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $126.4, was $1,780.2 as of
30 September 2013. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Goodwill increased in 2013, primarily as a result of the EPCO and WCG acquisitions
in Merchant Gases during the third quarter. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.

We perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that
potential impairment exists. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers
regularly. Currently, we have four business segments and thirteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment.

As part of the goodwill impairment testing, and as permitted under the accounting guidance, we have the option to first assess
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the



initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required.

The first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value,
including assigned goodwill. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we primarily use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a five-year growth period for the
business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital-intensive nature of the business, long-term contractual nature of
the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit
margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon
an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash
flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation
model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.

If the first step of the quantitative test indicates
potential impairment, the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill would be compared to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill was greater than its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recorded.

During 2013, there were no events or changes in circumstances identified that warranted interim goodwill impairment
testing. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment utilizing the quantitative approach. We determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value,
and therefore there were no indications of impairment.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 September 2013 totaled $626.7 and consisted primarily of customer
relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2013 totaled $90.6 and consisted of trade names and trademarks.
Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived
intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. We have the option to
first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying value prior to performing the additional quantitative testing. To determine fair value,
we utilize an income approach, the royalty savings method. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, we conducted the required annual impairment test utilizing the quantitative approach and determined
that the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded its carrying value.

Equity Investments

Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,195.5 at 30 September 2013. The majority of
our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the
consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.

In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than
temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key



assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2013, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $63.0 and $662.7, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions
as of 30 September 2013 were $124.3, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2013 was $307.9. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated
financial statements.

Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet
amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.

Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several
years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.

Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax
credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to
avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.

A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $14.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

The amounts recognized in the
consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense
associated with the defined benefit plans.

Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to
the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.

Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to
the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates
on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. We believe the actuarial assumptions are
reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover.

One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched
against the returns of high-quality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. This rate will
change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate
decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $30 per year.

The expected rate of return on plan assets represents
the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns
of major asset classes and the historical



performance of plan assets. In determining asset class returns, we take into account historical long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment.
Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher
pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $18 per year.

We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return
based on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period
from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for fixed income investments is the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the
market-related value of assets.

The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this
rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation
increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $16 per year.

Loss Contingencies

In the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the
outcome and effect on us. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the
most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.

Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in
Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining
probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess
probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or
adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate
share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.

NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and
impact of new accounting guidance.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about earnings guidance and business outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this
release. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, weakening or
reversal of global or regional economic recovery; future financial and operating performance of major customers; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; the impact of competitive products
and pricing; interruption in ordinary sources of supply of raw materials; unanticipated asset impairments or losses; the impact of price fluctuations in natural gas; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from
customers; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory investigations; the impact of management and organizational changes, including the chief executive officer search; the success of productivity programs; the timing, impact, and other
uncertainties of future



acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; political risks, including the risks of unanticipated government
actions that may result in project delays, cancellations or expropriations; the impact of changes in environmental, tax or other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; the impact on the
effective tax rate of changes in the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations; and other risk factors described in Section 1A. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any
forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company’s assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based.

ITEM

7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to
market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with
debt capital.

We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use
of derivative financial instruments. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types
and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. Additionally, we mitigate
adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.

Our derivative
and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is
referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements.

At 30 September 2013 and 2012, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $5,719.5 and $4,925.1, respectively.
The increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the impact of a higher book value of long-term debt (excluding exchange rate impacts). The increase in book value was primarily driven by the issuance of a 2.0% Eurobond for

€

300.0 million ($397.0) on 7 August 2013 that matures on 7 August 2020 and the classification of $400.0 of commercial paper as
long-term debt due to our ability and intent to refinance the debt under our $2,500.0 committed credit facility maturing in 2018.

The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based
on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments
based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date.

Interest Rate Risk

Our debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of 30
September 2013 primarily comprised debt denominated in U.S. dollars (52%) and Euros (28%), including the effect of currency swaps. This debt portfolio is composed of 54% fixed-rate debt and 46% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates
have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash
flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position.

The sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates
from the level at 30 September 2013, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $143 and $150 in the net liability position of financial instruments at
30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $154 and $162 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively.



Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest
rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $29 and $26 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest
incurred by $29 and $26 per year at 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate
Risk

The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their
levels at 30 September 2013 and 2012, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of
$295 and $274 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the Euro versus the Pound
Sterling. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts are also used to
hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in
exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

Air Products’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting, which is defined in the following sentences, is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii)

provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting can only provide reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Our processes contain
self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

Management has
evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that, as of 30 September 2013, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued their opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of 30 September 2013 as stated in their report which appears herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as
of 30 September 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated income statements, consolidated comprehensive income statements, consolidated statements of equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
30 September 2013. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have audited the financial statement schedule referred to in Item 15(a)(2) in this Form 10-K. We also have audited the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of 30 September 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of 30 September 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
30 September 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of 30 September 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

(Millions of dollars, except for share data)

1.  MAJOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation Principles

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the accounts of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and those of its controlled subsidiaries (“we,” “our,” “us,” the
“Company,” “Air Products,” or “registrant”), which are generally majority owned. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

We consolidate all entities that we control. The general condition for control is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of
an entity. Control may also exist in arrangements where we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). An entity that will have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of
the VIE and the obligation to absorb the losses or receive the benefits significant to the VIE is considered a primary beneficiary of that entity. We have determined that we are not a primary beneficiary in any material VIE.

Certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation.

Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue from product sales is recognized as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer (which generally occurs at the
time shipment is made), the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Sales returns and allowances are not a business practice in the industry.

Revenue from equipment sale contracts is recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, revenue
from the sale of major equipment, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchangers and large



air separation units, is recognized primarily based on labor hours incurred to date compared with total estimated labor hours. Changes to total estimated labor hours and anticipated losses, if
any, are recognized in the period determined.

Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide
product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases. In cases where operating lease treatment is necessary, there is no difference in revenue recognition over the life of the contract as compared to accounting for the contract
as product sales. In cases where capital lease treatment is necessary, the timing of revenue and expense recognition is impacted. Revenue and expense are recognized up front for the sale of equipment component of the contract as compared to revenue
recognition over the life of the arrangement under contracts not qualifying as capital leases. Additionally, a portion of the revenue representing interest income from the financing component of the lease receivable is reflected as sales over the
life of the contract. Allowances for credit losses associated with capital lease receivables are recorded using the specific identification method. As of 30 September 2013, the credit quality of capital lease receivables did not require a
material allowance for credit losses.

If an arrangement involves multiple deliverables, the delivered items are
considered separate units of accounting if the items have value on a stand-alone basis. Revenues are allocated to each deliverable based upon relative selling prices derived from company specific evidence.

Amounts billed for shipping and handling fees are classified as sales in the consolidated income statements.

Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on
revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements. We record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales predominantly represents the cost of tangible products sold. These costs include labor, raw materials, plant engineering, power, depreciation, production supplies and materials packaging costs, and
maintenance costs. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are also included in cost of sales.

Depreciation

Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from
earnings every year over its expected economic useful life. The principal lives for major classes of plant and equipment are summarized in Note 9, Plant and Equipment, net.

Selling and Administrative

The principal components of selling and administrative expenses are salaries, advertising, and promotional costs.

Postemployment Benefits

When termination benefits provided to employees as
part of a cost reduction plan, such as that discussed in Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans, meet the definition of an ongoing benefit arrangement, a liability is recognized for termination benefits when probable and estimable.
These criteria are met when management, with the appropriate level of authority, approves and commits to its plan of action for termination; the plan identifies the employees to be terminated and their related benefits; and the plan is to be
completed within one year. During periods of operations where terminations are made on an as-needed basis, absent a detailed committed plan, terminations are accounted for on an individual basis and a liability is recognized when probable and
estimable. We have severance policies and plans for eligible employees.

Fair Value Measurements

We are required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial measurement or for subsequent
accounting or reporting. For example, fair value is used in the initial measurement of net assets acquired in a business combination; on a recurring basis in the measurement of derivative financial instruments; and on a nonrecurring basis when
long-lived assets are written down to fair value when held for sale or determined to be impaired. Refer to Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, for information on the methods and assumptions used in our fair value measurements.

Financial Instruments

We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The types of derivative financial instruments permitted for such
risk management programs are specified in policies set by management. Refer to Note 13, Financial Instruments, for further detail on the types and use of derivative instruments that we enter into.



Major financial institutions are counterparties to all of these derivative contracts.
We have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better. Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote, and any losses would be
immaterial to the consolidated financial results, financial condition, or liquidity.

We recognize derivatives on the
balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, we generally designate the derivative as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a
recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge), (2) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), or (3) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (fair
value hedge).

The following details the accounting treatment of our cash flow, fair value, net investment, and
non-designated hedges:

•

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets the cash flow hedge criteria are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(AOCI) to the extent effective and then recognized in earnings when the hedged items affect earnings.

•

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the
hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings.

•

Changes in the fair value of a derivative, foreign currency debt, and qualifying intercompany loans that are related to an outstanding borrowing from a third
party that are designated as and meet all the required criteria for a hedge of a net investment are recorded as translation adjustments in AOCI.

•

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in earnings.

We formally document the relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on
the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows
of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we will discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.

Foreign Currency

Since we do business in many foreign countries, fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations.

In most of our foreign operations, local currency is considered the functional currency. Foreign subsidiaries translate their assets
and liabilities into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates in effect at the end of the fiscal period. The gains or losses that result from this process are shown as translation adjustments in AOCI in the equity section of the balance sheet.

The revenue and expense accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates
that prevail during the period. Therefore, the U.S. dollar value of these items on the income statement fluctuates from period to period, depending on the value of the dollar against foreign currencies. Some transactions are made in currencies
different from an entity’s functional currency. Gains and losses from these foreign currency transactions are generally included in other income (expense), net on our consolidated income statements as they occur.

Environmental Expenditures

Accruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Remediation costs are capitalized if the costs
improve the Company’s property as compared with the condition of the property when originally constructed or acquired, or if the costs prevent environmental contamination from future operations. We expense environmental costs related to
existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $37.1 in fiscal 2013, $44.7
in 2012, and $34.0 in 2011.



The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on an evaluation of currently
available information with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. An environmental liability related to
cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures,
post-remediation monitoring costs, and outside legal fees. These liabilities include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that we have reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. They
do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or other parties and are not discounted.

As
assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amount of projected cost is reviewed, and the liability is adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Management has an established process in
place to identify and monitor the Company’s environmental exposures. An environmental accrual analysis is prepared and maintained that lists all environmental loss contingencies, even where an accrual has not been established. This analysis
assists in monitoring the Company’s overall environmental exposure and serves as a tool to facilitate ongoing communication among the Company’s technical experts, environmental managers, environmental lawyers, and financial management to
ensure that required accruals are recorded and potential exposures disclosed.

Given inherent uncertainties in evaluating
environmental exposures, actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information on the Company’s environmental loss
contingencies.

The accruals for environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily as
part of other noncurrent liabilities.

Litigation

In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings. We accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any
other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency includes estimates of potential damages and other directly related costs expected to be incurred. Refer to Note 17, Commitments
and Contingencies, for additional information on our current legal proceedings.

Share-Based Compensation

We have various share-based compensation programs, which include stock options, deferred stock units, and restricted
stock. We expense the grant-date fair value of these awards over the vesting period during which employees perform related services. Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would meet the requirements for vesting
of awards upon their retirement. We utilize a Black Scholes model to value stock option awards. Refer to Note 19, Share-Based Compensation, for further detail.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. A principal temporary difference results
from the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation because accelerated methods of depreciation and shorter useful lives are used for income tax purposes. The cumulative impact of a change in tax rates or regulations is included in income tax
expense in the period that includes the enactment date.

A tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is recognized when
it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. This position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense. For additional information regarding our income taxes, refer to Note 22, Income Taxes.

Cash and Cash Items

Cash and cash items include cash, time deposits, and certificates of deposit acquired with an original maturity of three months or less.



Trade Receivables, net

Trade receivables comprise amounts owed to us through our operating activities and are presented net of allowances for doubtful
accounts. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations. A provision for customer defaults is made on a general formula basis when it is
determined that the risk of some default is probable and estimable but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables
are past due, historical experience, and existing economic conditions. The allowances also include amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified, considering factors such as the financial condition of the
customer and customer disputes over contractual terms and conditions. Allowances for doubtful accounts were $101.7 and $103.5 as of fiscal year end 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively. Provisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts
charged against income were $27.6, $36.8 and $23.4 in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. We write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable
inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

We utilize the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) method for determining the cost of inventories in the Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, and Electronics and Performance Materials segments in the United States. Inventories for these segments outside of the United States are accounted for
on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, as the LIFO method is not generally permitted in the foreign jurisdictions where these segments operate. The inventories of the Equipment and Energy segment on a worldwide basis, as well as all other
inventories, are accounted for on the FIFO basis.

At the business segment level, inventories are recorded at FIFO and
the LIFO pool adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Refer to Note 7, Inventories, for further detail.

Equity Investments

The equity method of accounting is used when we exercise significant influence but do not have operating control, generally assumed to be 20%–50% ownership. Under the equity method, original investments are
recorded at cost and adjusted by our share of undistributed earnings or losses of these companies. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not
be recoverable. Refer to Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, for further detail.

Plant and
Equipment

Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction costs, labor, and
applicable overhead related to installations are capitalized. Expenditures for additions and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are capitalized. The costs of maintenance and repairs of plant and equipment are
charged to expense as incurred.

Fully depreciated assets are retained in the gross plant and equipment and accumulated
depreciation accounts until they are removed from service. In the case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal, are included in income. Refer to Note 9, Plant and
Equipment, net, for further detail.

Computer Software

We capitalize costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use. Capitalized costs include purchased computer software
packages, payments to vendors/consultants for development and implementation or modification to a purchased package to meet our requirements, payroll and related costs for employees directly involved in development, and interest incurred while
software is being developed. Capitalized computer software costs are included in the balance sheet classification plant and equipment, net and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software, generally a period of three to ten years.

Capitalized Interest

As we build new plant and equipment, we include in the cost of these assets a portion of the interest payments we make during the year. The amount of capitalized interest was $25.8, $30.2, and $22.7 in 2013, 2012,
and 2011, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and is
evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of



an asset group may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset group. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Long-lived assets to be sold are reported at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Government Grants

We receive government grants that primarily relate to research and development projects. Government grants are recognized when there
is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and that we have complied with the conditions of the grant. Government grants related to assets are included in the balance sheet as a reduction of the cost of the asset and result in reduced
depreciation expense over the useful life of the asset. Government grants that relate to expenses are recognized in the income statement as a reduction of the related expense or as a component of other income (expense), net.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The fair value of the liability is measured using discounted estimated cash flows and is
adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s
useful life. The Company’s asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with Tonnage Gases on-site long-term supply contracts, under which the Company has built a facility on land owned by the customer and is obligated to remove the
facility at the end of the contract term. The Company’s asset retirement obligations totaled $89.8 and $76.7 at 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Goodwill

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values. Any excess purchase
price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. Preliminary purchase price allocations are made at the date of acquisition and finalized when information needed to affirm
underlying estimates is obtained, within a maximum allocation period of one year.

Goodwill is subject to impairment
testing at least annually. In addition, goodwill is tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. Refer to Note 10, Goodwill, for further detail.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily consist of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. The cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated period of economic benefit. No residual value is estimated for these intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to
impairment testing at least annually. In addition, intangible assets are tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists.

Customer relationships are generally amortized over periods of five to twenty-five years. Purchased patents and technology and other
are generally amortized over periods of five to twenty years. Land use rights, which are included in other intangibles, are generally amortized over a period of fifty years. Amortizable lives are adjusted whenever there is a change in the estimated
period of economic benefit. Refer to Note 11, Intangible Assets, for further detail.

Retirement Benefits

The cost of pension benefits is recognized over the employees’ service period. We are required to use actuarial
methods and assumptions in the valuation of defined benefit obligations and the determination of expense. Differences between actual and expected results or changes in the value of obligations and plan assets are not recognized in earnings as they
occur but, rather, systematically and gradually over subsequent periods. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, for disclosures related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.

MPAIRMENT

In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance that provides an entity the option
to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carrying amount, entities must perform the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the quantitative test is optional. This guidance was effective for goodwill impairment tests performed this
fiscal year and did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

In July 2012, the FASB amended the guidance
on indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing to allow companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived asset is less than its
carrying amount. If it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying amount, entities must perform the quantitative analysis of the asset impairment test. Otherwise, the
quantitative test is optional. This guidance was effective for indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests performed this fiscal year and did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

3.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

During the second quarter of 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which had previously been
reported as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment.

On 30 April 2012, we sold the majority of our Homecare
business to The Linde Group for sale proceeds of

€

590 million ($777). This amount included contingent proceeds of

€

110 million ($144) related to the outcome of certain retender arrangements. As of 30 September 2013, this liability is reflected
in payables and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, with payment expected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. As part of the sale, we subsequently received

€

32 million ($42) of additional cash proceeds based upon collection of certain accounts receivable balances. In the third quarter of 2012, we recognized a gain of $207.4 ($150.3 after-tax, or $.70 per
share) on the sale of this business.

During the third quarter of 2012, an impairment charge of $33.5 ($29.5 after-tax,
or $.14 per share) was recorded to write down the remaining business, which is primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland, to its estimated net realizable value. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an additional charge of $18.7 ($13.6
after-tax, or $.06 per share) to update our estimate of the net realizable value as we continue to market the business for sale.

The Homecare business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation. The results of operations and cash flows of this business have been reclassified from the results of continuing operations for all periods
presented. The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations have been reclassified and are segregated in the consolidated balance sheets.

The results of discontinued operations are summarized below:

For the year ended 30 September 2011, the income tax provision includes a tax benefit of $8.9,
or $.04 per share, resulting from the completion of an audit of tax years 2007 and 2008 by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service related to our previously divested U.S. Healthcare business. For additional details on this tax benefit, refer to Note 22,
Income Taxes.

Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations consist of the following:



4.  BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND COST REDUCTION
PLANS

We recorded charges in 2013 and 2012 for business restructuring and cost reduction plans. These charges are
reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans.” The charges for these plans have been excluded from segment operating income.

2013 Plan

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an expense of $231.6 ($157.9 after-tax, or $.74 per share) reflecting actions to better align our cost structure with current market conditions. These charges include
$100.4 for asset actions and $58.5 for the final settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract primarily impacting the Electronics business due to continued weakness in the photovoltaic (PV) and light-emitting diode (LED) markets. In
addition, $71.9 was recorded for severance, benefits, and other contractual obligations associated with the elimination of approximately 700 positions and executive changes. These charges primarily impact our Merchant Gases businesses and
corporate functions. The actions are in response to weaker than expected business conditions in Europe and Asia, reorganization of our operations and functional areas, and previously announced senior executive changes. The planned actions are
expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2014.

The 2013 charges relate to the businesses at the segment level
as follows: $61.0 in Merchant Gases, $28.6 in Tonnage Gases, $141.0 in Electronics and Performance Materials, and $1.0 in Equipment and Energy.

The following table summarizes the carrying amount of the accrual for the 2013 plan at 30 September 2013:

2012 Plans

In 2012, we recorded an expense of $327.4 ($222.4 after-tax, or $1.03 per share) for business restructuring and cost reduction plans
in our Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI), Electronics, and European Merchant businesses.

During the second quarter of
2012, we recorded an expense of $86.8 ($60.6 after-tax, or $.28 per share) for actions to remove stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the Homecare business, the reorganization of the Merchant business, and actions to right-size our
European cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook. The charge related to the businesses at the segment level as follows: $77.3 in Merchant Gases, $3.8 in Tonnage Gases, and $5.7 in Electronics and Performance Materials. As of
30 September 2013, the planned actions were completed.

During the fourth quarter of 2012, we took actions to exit
the PUI business to improve costs, resulting in a net expense of $54.6 ($34.8 after-tax, or $.16 per share). We sold certain assets and the rights to a supply contract for $32.7 in cash at closing. In connection with these actions, we recognized an
expense of $26.6, for the net book value of assets sold and those committed to be disposed of other than by sale. The remaining charge was primarily related to contract terminations and an environmental liability. Our PUI production facility in
Pasadena, Texas is currently being dismantled, with completion expected in fiscal year 2014. The costs to dismantle are expensed as incurred and reflected in continuing operations in the Tonnage Gases business segment.

During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed an assessment of our position in the PV market, resulting in $186.0 of expense
($127.0 after-tax, or $.59 per share) primarily related to the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. Air Products supplies the PV market with both bulk and on-site supply of gases, including silane. The PV market has not developed as
expected, and as a result, the market capacity to produce silane is expected to exceed demand for the foreseeable future. Included in the charge was an accrual of $93.5 for an offer that we made to terminate a long term take-or-pay contract to
purchase silane. A final settlement was reached with the supplier in the fourth quarter of 2013.



The following table summarizes the carrying amount of the accrual for the 2012 plans
at 30 September 2013:

(A)

Charge is net of $32.7 in proceeds received in cash at closing for certain PUI assets and the rights to a supply contract.

(B)

Other includes the write-down of inventory to its net realizable value, the write-down of accounts receivable, and expected losses on purchase commitments.

(C)

Reflected in accrual for environmental obligations. See Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies.

5.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

2013 Business Combinations

We completed three acquisitions in 2013. The acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations, and their results of
operations were consolidated within their respective segments after the acquisition dates. The aggregate purchase price, net of cash acquired, for these acquisitions was $233 and resulted in recognition of $68 of goodwill, none of which is
deductible for tax purposes.

On 30 August 2013, we acquired an air separation unit and
integrated gases liquefier in Guiyang, China. This acquisition included a long-term sale of gas contract within our Tonnage Gases Segment and provided our Merchant Gases segment with additional liquid capacity in the region. On 31 May 2013, we
acquired EPCO Carbondioxide Products, Inc. (EPCO), the largest independent U.S. producer of liquid carbon dioxide (CO


). This acquisition expanded our North American offerings of bulk industrial process gases in the Merchant Gases segment. On 1 April 2013, we acquired Wuxi Chem-Gas Company, Ltd. (WCG). This acquisition
provided our Merchant Gases segment with additional gases presence in the Jiangsu Province of China.

2012 Business
Combinations

Indura S.A.

In July 2012, we acquired a 64.8% controlling equity interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A. We paid cash consideration in
Chilean pesos (CLP) of 345.5 billion ($690) and assumed debt of CLP113.8 billion ($227) for these interests. Prior to the acquisition, Indura S.A. was the largest independent industrial gas company in South America. Indura S.A.’s integrated gas
and retail business comprises packaged gases and hardgoods, liquid bulk, healthcare, and on-sites.

Under the purchase
agreement, the largest minority shareholder has a right to exercise a put option to require Air Products to purchase up to a 30.5% equity interest during the two-year period beginning on 1 July 2015, at a redemption value equal to fair market
value (subject to a minimum price based upon the acquisition date value escalated by an inflation factor). Under the agreement, we also had an obligation to purchase 2.0% of the remaining shares of Indura S.A. During the third quarter of 2013, we
purchased these shares for CLP5.5 billion ($11). As of 30 September 2013, we hold a 67.2% interest in Indura S.A.

For the year ended 30 September 2012, acquisition related costs of $11.4 were recognized for this transaction. Debt issuance
costs of $4.9 are included within interest expense and acquisition costs of $6.5 are included within selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated income statements.



The acquisition of Indura S.A. was accounted for as a business combination. Following
the acquisition date, 100% of the Indura S.A. results were consolidated in our Merchant Gases business segment. The portion of the business that is not owned by the Company is recorded as noncontrolling interests.

The following table summarizes the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Indura
S.A. and the resulting goodwill as of the acquisition date:

(A)

Includes cash and cash items, prepaid expenses, other current assets, payables and accrued liabilities, and other current liabilities.

The noncontrolling interests of Indura S.A., including redeemable
noncontrolling interest, were recorded on the acquisition date at fair value. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 20, Noncontrolling Interests, for additional information.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill of $626.2 is attributable to expected growth and cost synergies resulting from the acquisition. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.

We acquired identifiable intangible assets, primarily in the form of customer relationships and trade names and trademarks, with a
total estimated fair value of $382.1. Customer relationships have an estimated fair value of $287.8 and are being amortized over their estimated useful life of 23 years. Trade names and trademarks have an estimated fair value of $92.6. Since we
intend to use these for the foreseeable future, they are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Consolidated Actual and Unaudited Pro forma Information

For the year ended 30 September 2012, sales and net income attributable to Air Products included in our consolidated income
statements reflects Indura S.A. sales of $140.0 and net loss of $7.6. Indura’s net loss includes a non-cash charge of $14.1 related to a Chilean tax rate change.

The unaudited pro forma results on a continuing operations basis presented below include the effects of the Indura S.A. acquisition
as if it had occurred as of 1 October 2010.

The unaudited pro forma results are based on historical results of operations, adjusted for the
allocation of purchase price and other acquisition accounting adjustments, and are not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisition been completed on 1 October 2010.

The unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acquisition.



DA NanoMaterials LLC

On 2 April 2012, we acquired E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co. Inc.’s 50% interest in our joint venture, DuPont Air Products
NanoMaterials LLC (DA NanoMaterials), for $158 ($147 net of cash acquired of $11). The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the results of DA NanoMaterials were consolidated within
our Electronics and Performance Materials business segment.

Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our 50% interest
in DA NanoMaterials as an equity-method investment. The acquisition-date fair value of the previously held equity interest was valued at $120 and was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis under the income approach. The income approach
required estimating a number of factors, including projected revenue growth, customer attrition rates, profit margin, and discount rate. The year ended 30 September 2012 includes a gain of $85.9 ($54.6 after-tax, or $.25 per share) as a result
of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair value as of the acquisition date. This gain is reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Gain on previously held equity interest.”

6.  AIRGAS TRANSACTION

In February 2010, we commenced a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas), including the
associated preferred stock purchase rights. Based on a decision by the Delaware Chancery Court to uphold the decision of Airgas’ Board of Directors to retain the preferred stock purchase rights, we withdrew our offer on 15 February 2011.

Prior to the tender offer, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for a total cost of $69.6.
On 16 February 2011, we sold the 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for total proceeds of $94.7 and recognized a gain of $25.1 ($15.9 after-tax, or $.07 per share).

For the year ended 30 September 2011, a net loss of $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share) was recognized related to this
transaction. This amount is reflected separately on the consolidated income statement as “Net loss on Airgas transaction” and includes amortization of fees related to a term loan credit facility, the gain on the sale of Airgas stock, and
other acquisition-related costs. In addition, cash payments for the acquisition-related costs of $156.2 are classified as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended 30 September 2011.

7.  INVENTORIES

The components of inventories are as follows:

Inventories valued using the LIFO method comprised 36.4% and 35.6% of consolidated inventories
before LIFO adjustment at 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively. Liquidation of LIFO inventory layers in 2013, 2012, and 2011 did not materially affect the results of operations.

FIFO cost approximates replacement cost. Our inventory has a high turnover, and as a result, there is little difference between the
original cost of an item and its current replacement cost.



8.  SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF EQUITY
AFFILIATES

The table below presents summarized financial information on a combined 100% basis of the companies
accounted for by the equity method. Amounts presented include the accounts of the following equity affiliates:

On 29 May 2012, we purchased 25% of the outstanding shares of Abdullah Hashim Industrial
Gases & Equipment Co. Ltd. (AHG) for SAR581.3 million ($155). AHG is a company of the privately-owned Abdullah Hashim Group, based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. AHG is the largest private industrial gases company in Saudi Arabia. It
comprises three businesses, including industrial gases, equipment and consumables and refrigerants. The transaction was recorded as an investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates in the Merchant Gases segment.

In the third quarter of 2012, we obtained control of DA NanoMaterials and began consolidating its results. Refer to Note 5, Business
Combinations, for additional information. The unaudited amounts presented below include the results of DA NanoMaterials for 2011.

Dividends received from equity affiliates were $108.6, $89.0, and $105.9 in 2013, 2012, and 2011,
respectively.

The investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates as of 30 September 2013 and
2012 included investment in foreign affiliates of $1,191.3 and $1,171.0, respectively.

As of 30 September 2013
and 2012, the amount of investment in companies accounted for by the equity method included goodwill in the amount of $126.4.



9.  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET

The major classes of plant and equipment are as follows:

(A)

Depreciable lives of production facilities related to long-term customer supply contracts are matched to the contract lives.

(B)

The depreciable lives for various types of distribution equipment are 10 to 25 years for cylinders, depending on the nature and properties of the product; 20
years for tanks; 7.5 years for customer stations; and 5 to 15 years for tractors and trailers.

Depreciation expense was $864.7, $813.7, and $811.7 in 2013, 2012, and
2011, respectively.

10.  GOODWILL

Changes to the carrying amount of consolidated goodwill by segment are as follows:

Merchant Gases goodwill increased during 2013, primarily due to the acquisitions of EPCO and WCG
during the third quarter. Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials goodwill increased during 2012 due to the acquisition of Indura S.A. and DA NanoMaterials, respectively. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, for further details
on these acquisitions.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment.
We determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment.



11.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The table below provides details of acquired intangible assets:

Refer to Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, for amortization periods associated with our intangible
assets.

Amortization expense for intangible assets was $42.3, $27.1, and $22.6 in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Projected annual amortization expense for intangible assets as of 30 September 2013 is as follows:

12.  LEASES

Lessee Accounting

Capital leases, primarily for the right to use machinery and equipment, are included with owned plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of $19.8 and $13.6 at 30 September 2013 and
2012, respectively. Related amounts of accumulated depreciation are $8.5 and $8.8, respectively.

Operating leases
principally relate to real estate and also include aircraft, distribution equipment, and vehicles. Certain leases include escalation clauses, renewal, and/or purchase options. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum
lease term. Rent expense under operating leases, including month-to-month agreements, was $98.6 in 2013, $91.1 in 2012, and $90.5 in 2011.

At 30 September 2013, minimum payments due under leases are as follows:

Lessor Accounting

As discussed under Revenue Recognition in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, certain contracts associated with facilities that are
built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases. Lease receivables, net, were included principally in noncurrent capital lease receivables on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remaining balance in
current capital lease receivables.



The components of lease receivables were as follows:

30 September



Gross minimum lease payments receivable

Lease payments collected in 2013, 2012, and 2011 were $120.0, $103.0, and $84.6, respectively.

At 30 September 2013, minimum lease payments expected to be collected are as follows:

13.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Currency Price Risk Management

Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated transactions and net investments in foreign operations. It is our policy to minimize our cash
flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. This is accomplished by identifying and evaluating the risk that our cash flows will change in value due to changes in exchange rates and by executing the appropriate strategies necessary to
manage such exposures. Our objective is to maintain economically balanced currency risk management strategies that provide adequate downside protection.

Forward Exchange Contracts

We enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce
the cash flow exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with highly anticipated cash flows and certain firm commitments, such as the purchase of plant and equipment. The maximum remaining term of any forward exchange contract currently
outstanding and designated as a cash flow hedge at 30 September 2013 is 3.2 years. Forward exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates by creating a liability in a currency
in which we have a net equity position. The primary currency pair in this portfolio of forward exchange contracts is the Euro/U.S. dollar.

In addition to the forward exchange contracts that are designated as hedges, we utilize forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges. These contracts are used to economically hedge foreign
currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily working capital. The primary objective of these forward exchange contracts is to protect the value of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the effects of
volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their receipt or settlement. This portfolio of forward exchange contracts comprises many different foreign currency pairs, with a profile that changes from time to time depending on
business activity and sourcing decisions.

The table below summarizes our outstanding currency price risk management
instruments:



In addition to the above, we use foreign currency-denominated debt to hedge the
foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The designated foreign currency denominated debt at 30 September 2013 included

€

908.3 million ($1,228.4) and at 30 September 2012 included

€

888.2 million
($1,142.2).

Debt Portfolio Management

It is our policy to identify on a continuing basis the need for debt capital and evaluate the financial risks inherent in funding
the Company with debt capital. Reflecting the result of this ongoing review, the debt portfolio and hedging program are managed with the objectives and intent to (1) reduce funding risk with respect to borrowings made by us to preserve our
access to debt capital and provide debt capital as required for funding and liquidity purposes, and (2) manage the aggregate interest rate risk and the debt portfolio in accordance with certain debt management parameters.

Interest Rate Management Contracts

We enter into interest rate swaps to change the fixed/variable interest rate mix of our debt portfolio in order to maintain the percentage of fixed- and variable-rate debt within the parameters set by management.
In accordance with these parameters, the agreements are used to manage interest rate risks and costs inherent in our debt portfolio. Our interest rate management portfolio generally consists of fixed to floating interest rate swaps (which are
designated as fair value hedges), pre-issuance interest rate swaps and treasury locks (which hedge the interest rate risk associated with anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances and are designated as cash flow hedges), and floating to fixed interest
rate swaps (which are designated as cash flow hedges). At 30 September 2013, the outstanding interest rate swaps were denominated in U.S. dollars and Chilean Pesos. The maximum remaining term of any interest rate swap designated as a cash flow
hedge is 1.4 years. The notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements is equal to or less than the designated debt being hedged. When interest rate swaps are used to hedge variable-rate debt, the indices of the swaps and the debt to which
they are designated are the same. It is our policy not to enter into any interest rate management contracts which lever a move in interest rates on a greater than one-to-one basis.

Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap Contracts

We enter into cross currency interest rate swap contracts when our risk management function deems necessary. These contracts may
entail both the exchange of fixed- and floating-rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement and the exchange of one currency for another currency at inception and at a specified future date. These contracts effectively convert
the currency denomination of a debt instrument into another currency in which we have a net equity position while changing the interest rate characteristics of the instrument. The contracts are used to hedge either certain net investments in foreign
operations or non-functional currency cash flows related to intercompany loans. The current cross currency interest rate swap portfolio consists of fixed-to-fixed swaps between U.S. dollars and Chilean Pesos, U.S. dollars and offshore Chinese
Renminbi, as well as U.S. dollars and British Pound Sterling.

The following table summarizes our outstanding interest
rate management contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps:



The table below summarizes the fair value and balance sheet location of our
outstanding derivatives:

Refer to Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, describes the method for
measuring fair value, and provides additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.

The table below summarizes
the gain or loss related to our cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:

(A)

Other includes the impact on other comprehensive income (OCI) and earnings primarily related to interest rate swaps.

(B)

The impact of fair value hedges noted above was largely offset by gains and losses resulting from the impact of changes in related interest rates on recognized
outstanding debt.

(C)

The impact of the non-designated hedges noted above was largely offset by gains and losses, respectively, resulting from the impact of changes in exchange rates
on recognized assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies.



The amount of cash flow hedges’ unrealized gains and losses at 30 September
2013 that are expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months is not material.

The cash flows related
to all derivative contracts are reported in the operating activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features

Certain derivative instruments are executed under agreements that require us to maintain a minimum credit rating with both
Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. If our credit rating falls below this threshold, the counterparty to the derivative instruments has the right to request full collateralization on the derivatives’ net liability position. The
net liability position of derivatives with credit risk-related contingent features was $10.0 as of 30 September 2013 and $13.8 as of 30 September 2012. Because our current credit rating is above the various pre-established
thresholds, no collateral has been posted on these liability positions.

Counterparty Credit Risk Management

We execute financial derivative transactions with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions, all
of which are investment grade at this time. Some of our underlying derivative agreements give us the right to require the institution to post collateral if its credit rating falls below the pre-established thresholds with Standard &
Poor’s or Moody’s. These are the same agreements referenced in Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features above. The collateral that the counterparties would be required to post was $80.6 as of 30 September 2013 and $90.1 as of
30 September 2012. No financial institution is required to post collateral at this time, as all have credit ratings at or above the threshold.

14.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is
defined as an exit price, i.e., the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as
follows:

Level 1—Quoted

prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2—Inputs

that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

Level 3—Inputs

that are unobservable for the asset or liability based on our own assumptions (about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability).

The methods and assumptions used to measure the fair value of
financial instruments are as follows:

Derivatives

The fair value of our interest rate management contracts and forward exchange contracts are quantified using the income approach and
are based on estimates using standard pricing models. These models take into account the value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the time to maturity and currency
of the underlying instruments. The computation of the fair values of these instruments is generally performed by the Company. These standard pricing models utilize inputs which are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as
interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. In addition, on an ongoing basis, we randomly test a subset of our valuations against valuations received from the transaction’s counterparty to validate the accuracy of our
standard pricing models. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions.

Refer to
Note 13, Financial Instruments, for a description of derivative instruments, including details on the balance sheet line classifications.

Long-term Debt

The fair value of our debt is based on estimates using standard
pricing models that take into account the value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the time to maturity and currency of the underlying instruments. These standard
valuation models utilize observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot rates. Therefore, the fair value of our debt is classified as a level 2 measurement. We generally perform the computation of the fair value of these
instruments.



The carrying values and fair values of financial instruments were as follows:

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash items, trade receivables,
payables and accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes, and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the above table.

The following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance
sheets:

The following is a tabular presentation of nonrecurring fair value measurements along with the level
within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls:

(A)

In conjunction with the 2013 and 2012 business restructuring and cost reduction plans, long-lived assets held for sale were written down to fair value, and the
loss was included in the respective charges. For additional information, see Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans. We quantified the fair value of the assets held for sale using a market approach, based on prices for other market
transactions involving comparable assets and our assessment of value considering our knowledge of the markets.

(B)

During 2013 and 2012, impairment charges were recorded for the remaining assets of the Homecare business to reflect their estimated net realizable value. For
additional information, see Note 3, Discontinued Operations. We utilized a market approach to determine the fair value based on our current assessment of the markets for these assets.

Refer to Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, for additional information
on our accounting and reporting of the fair value of financial instruments.



15.  DEBT

The tables below summarize our outstanding debt at 30 September 2013 and 2012:

Total Debt

The weighted average interest rate of short-term borrowings outstanding at 30 September 2013
and 2012 was 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively.

Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $136.1 in 2013,
$127.6 in 2012, and $117.4 in 2011.

Long-term Debt



Maturities of long-term debt in each of the next five years and beyond are as follows:

On 4 February 2013, we issued a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 2.75% note that matures on
3 February 2023. Additionally, on 7 August 2013, we issued a 2.0% Eurobond for

€

300 million ($397) that matures on
7 August 2020.

Various debt agreements to which we are a party also include financial covenants and other
restrictions, including restrictions pertaining to the ability to create property liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. As of 30 September 2013, we are in compliance with all the financial and other covenants under our
debt agreements.

As of 30 September 2013, we have classified commercial paper of $400.0 maturing in 2014 as
long-term debt because we have the ability and intent to refinance the debt under our $2,500.0 committed credit facility maturing in 2018. Our current intent is to refinance this debt via the U.S. public or private placement markets.

On 30 April 2013, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “2013
Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. The 2013 Credit Agreement provides us with a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. This agreement increases the
previously existing facility by $330.0, extends the maturity date to 30 April 2018, and modifies the financial covenant to a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling
interest) no greater than 70%. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2013.

The 2013 Credit Agreement terminates and replaces our previous $2,170.0 revolving credit agreement dated 8 July 2010, as subsequently amended, which was to mature 30 June 2015 and had a financial
covenant of long-term debt divided by the sum of long-term debt plus equity of no greater than 60%. No borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement at the time of its termination and no early termination penalties were incurred.

Effective 11 June 2012, we entered into an offshore Chinese Renminbi (RMB) syndicated credit facility of
RMB1,000.0 million ($163.5), maturing in June 2015. There are RMB250.0 million ($40.9) in outstanding borrowings under this commitment at 30 September 2013.

Additional commitments totaling $383.0 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $309.0 was borrowed and outstanding at
30 September 2013.



16.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a
substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution
plans. The principal defined contribution plan is the Retirement Savings Plan, in which a substantial portion of the U.S. employees participate; a similar plan is offered to U.K. employees. We also provide other postretirement benefits consisting
primarily of healthcare benefits to U.S. retirees who meet age and service requirements.

Defined Benefit Pension
Plans

Pension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment. The
cost of our defined benefit pension plans included the following components:

Our U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of
retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the retirement date. Pension settlements are recognized when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal
year. We recognized $12.4 of settlement losses in 2013. Special termination benefits for 2013 and 2012 are primarily related to the cost reduction plans initiated in their respective years.

We calculate net periodic pension cost for a given fiscal year based on assumptions developed at the end of the previous fiscal
year. The following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic pension cost:

The projected benefit obligation (PBO) is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable
to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future salary increases. The following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used in the calculation of the PBO:



The following table reflects the change in the PBO and the change in the fair value of
plan assets based on the plan year measurement date, as well as the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets:

The changes in plan assets and benefit obligation that have been recognized in other comprehensive
income on a pretax basis during 2013 and 2012 consist of the following:

The net actuarial (gain) loss represents the actual changes in the estimated obligation and plan
assets that have not yet been recognized in the consolidated income statement and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Actuarial gains arising during 2013 are primarily attributable to higher discount rates and higher than expected
actual returns on plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are not recognized immediately, but instead are accumulated as a part of the unrecognized net loss balance and amortized into net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service
period of participating employees as certain thresholds are met.



The components recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on a pretax basis at
30 September consisted of:

The amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss at 30 September 2013 that is expected to be
recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost during fiscal year 2014, excluding amounts that may be recognized through settlement losses, is as follows:

U.S.

International

Net actuarial loss

$83.2

$35.1

Prior service cost

2.8

.1

The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed
to employee service rendered to a particular date, based on current salaries. The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans was $3,990.7 and $4,012.6 at the end of 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The following table provides information on pension plans where the benefit liability exceeds the value of plan assets:

Included in the tables above are several pension arrangements that are not funded because of
jurisdictional practice. The ABO and PBO related to these plans for 2013 were $143.7 and $164.8, respectively.

Pension Plan Assets

Our pension plan investment strategy is to invest in diversified portfolios to earn a long-term return consistent with acceptable risk in order to pay retirement benefits and meet regulatory funding requirements
while minimizing company cash contributions over time. The plans invest primarily in passive and actively managed equity and debt securities. Equity investments are diversified geographically and by investment style and market capitalization.
Company stock is only included in plan assets as a component of index funds. Fixed income investments include sovereign, corporate and asset-backed securities generally denominated in the currency of the plan.

Asset allocation targets are established based on the long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset
classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Actual allocations vary from target due to market changes and are reviewed regularly. Assets are routinely rebalanced through contributions, benefit payments, and
otherwise as deemed appropriate. The actual and target allocations at the measurement date are as follows:



The 8.3% expected return for U.S. plan assets is based on a weighted average of
estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. The estimated long-term return for equity, debt securities, and real estate is 9.3%, 5.7%, and 7.1%, respectively. In determining asset class
returns, we take into account historical long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as other economic and market factors.

The 6.5% expected rate of return for International plan assets is based on a weighted average return for plans outside the U.S., which vary significantly in size, asset structure and expected returns. The expected
asset return for the U.K. plan, which represents over 75% of the assets of our International plans, is 7.0% and can be derived from expected equity and debt security returns of 7.6% and 4.6%, respectively.

The following table summarizes pension plan assets measured at fair value by asset class (see Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, for
definition of the levels):



The following table summarizes changes in fair value of the pension plan assets
classified as Level 3, by asset class:

The descriptions and fair value methodologies for the U.S. and International pension plan assets are
as follows:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity.

Equity Securities

Equity securities are valued at the closing market price reported on a U.S. exchange where the security is actively traded and are therefore classified as Level 1 assets.

Mutual Funds

Shares of mutual funds are valued at their published closing net asset value (NAV) and are classified as Level 1 assets.

Pooled Funds

Securities are valued at the NAV of the shares held at year end,
which is based on the fair value of the underlying investments, and are classified as Level 2 assets.

Corporate and
Government Bonds

Corporate and government bonds are classified as Level 2 assets, as they are either valued at
quoted market prices from observable pricing sources at the reporting date or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields and credit ratings.

Mortgage and Asset-Backed Securities

Securities are classified as Level 2
assets, as they are either valued at quoted market prices from observable pricing sources at the reporting date or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields, credit ratings, and purpose of the underlying loan.

Real Estate Pooled Funds

Funds are classified as Level 3 assets, as they are carried at the estimated fair value of the underlying properties. Estimated fair value is calculated utilizing a combination of key inputs, such as revenue and
expense growth rates, terminal capitalization rates, and discount rates. These key inputs are consistent with practices prevailing within the real estate investment management industry.

Other Pooled Funds

Securities classified as Level 2 assets are valued at the NAV of the shares held at year end, which is based on the fair value of the underlying investments. Securities and interests classified as Level 3 are
carried at the estimated fair value of the underlying investments. The underlying investments are valued based on bids from brokers or other third-party vendor sources that utilize expected cash flow streams and other uncorroborated data, including
counterparty credit quality, default risk, discount rates, and the overall capital market liquidity.

Insurance
Contracts

Insurance contracts are classified as Level 3 assets, as they are carried at contract value, which
approximates the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment of the insurance company.



Contributions and Projected Benefit Payments

Pension contributions of $300.8 for fiscal year 2013 include voluntary contributions for the U.S. plans of $220.0. These
contributions resulted from an assessment of long-term funding requirements of the plans and tax planning. We anticipate contributing $80 to $100 to the defined benefit pension plans in 2014. These contributions are dependent upon the timing of
retirements.

Projected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are as follows:

These estimated benefit payments are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit
payments may vary significantly from these estimates.

Defined Contribution Plans

We maintain a nonleveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) which forms part of the Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
Retirement Savings Plan (RSP). The ESOP was established in May of 2002. The balance of the RSP is a qualified defined contribution plan including a 401(k) elective deferral component. A substantial portion of U.S. employees are eligible and
participate.

We treat dividends paid on ESOP shares as ordinary dividends. Under existing tax law, we may deduct
dividends which are paid with respect to shares held by the plan. Shares of the Company’s common stock in the ESOP totaled 3,691,435 as of 30 September 2013.

We match a portion of the participants’ contributions to the RSP and other various worldwide defined contribution plans. Our
contributions to the RSP include a Company core contribution for certain eligible employees who do not receive their primary retirement benefit from the defined benefit pension plans, with the core contribution based on a percentage of pay that is
dependent on years of service. For the RSP, we also make matching contributions on overall employee contributions as a percentage of the employee contribution and include an enhanced contribution for certain eligible employees that do not
participate in the defined benefit pension plans. Worldwide contributions expensed to income in 2013, 2012, and 2011 were $40.6, $33.9, and $31.3, respectively.

Other Postretirement Benefits

We provide other postretirement benefits
consisting primarily of healthcare benefits to certain U.S. retirees who meet age and service requirements. The healthcare benefit is a continued medical benefit until the retiree reaches age 65. Healthcare benefits are contributory, with
contributions adjusted periodically. The retiree medical costs are capped at a specified dollar amount, with the retiree contributing the remainder.

The cost of our other postretirement benefit plans includes the following components:

We calculate net periodic postretirement cost for a given fiscal year based on assumptions developed
at the end of the previous fiscal year. The discount rate assumption used in the calculation of net periodic postretirement cost for 2013, 2012, and 2011 was 1.9%, 3.7%, and 2.8%, respectively.

We measure the other postretirement benefits as of 30 September. The discount rate assumption used in the calculation of the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 2.4% and 1.9% for 2013 and 2012, respectively.



The following table reflects the change in the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation and the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets:

The changes in benefit obligation that have been recognized in other comprehensive income on a
pretax basis during 2013 and 2012 for our other postretirement benefit plans consist of the following:

The net actuarial loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on a pretax basis was
$19.7 at 30 September 2013 and $36.5 at 30 September 2012. Of the 30 September 2013 net actuarial loss, it is estimated that $1.7 will be amortized into net periodic postretirement cost during fiscal year 2014.

The effect of a change in the healthcare trend rate is tempered by a cap on the average retiree
medical cost. The impact of a one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate on net periodic postretirement cost and the obligation is not material.

Projected benefit payments are as follows:

These estimated benefit payments are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit
payments may vary significantly from these estimates.



17.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation

We are involved in various legal proceedings, including competition, environmental, health, safety, product liability, and insurance matters. In September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic
Defense (CADE) issued a decision against our Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R$179.2 million (approximately
$81 at 30 September 2013) on Air Products Brasil Ltda. This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice whose investigation began in 2003, alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of
industrial and medical gases. The fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003.

We have denied
the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 with the Brazilian courts. Certain of our defenses, if successful, could result in the matter being dismissed with no fine against us. We, with advice of our outside legal
counsel, have assessed the status of this matter and have concluded that, although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is reasonably possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result, no provision has been made in the
consolidated financial statements. We estimate the maximum possible loss to be the full amount of the fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $81 at 30 September 2013) plus interest accrued thereon until final disposition of the proceedings.

We are required to provide security for the payment of the fine (and interest) in order to suspend execution of the
judgment during the appeal process, during which time interest will accrue on the fine. The security is only collectible by the court in the event we are not successful in our appeal and do not timely pay the fine. The security could be in the form
of a bank guarantee or in other forms which the courts deem acceptable. The form of security to be provided by us has not been finally determined.

While we do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with this or any other legal proceeding would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or net cash flows, a future
charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.

Environmental

In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal
proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA: the federal Superfund law), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the
designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently, there are approximately 33 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where we, along with others, have been designated a potentially responsible party by the
Environmental Protection Agency or are otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of our current and former manufacturing sites. We continually monitor these sites for which we have environmental
exposure.

Accruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated consistent with the policy set forth in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2013 and 2012
included an accrual of $86.7 and $87.5, respectively, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities. The environmental liabilities will be paid over a period of up to 30 years. We estimate the exposure for environmental loss contingencies
to range from $86 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $100 as of 30 September 2013.

Actual costs to be
incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Using reasonably possible alternative assumptions of the exposure level could result in an increase to
the environmental accrual. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to the reasonably possible upper exposure level could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a
different remediation alternative is identified, or a significant increase in our proportionate share occurs. We do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed
above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year.



P

ACE

At 30 September 2013, $33.0 of the environmental accrual was related to the Pace facility.

In 2006, we sold our Amines business, which included operations at Pace, Florida and recognized a liability for retained
environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at Pace. We are required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to continue our
remediation efforts. We estimated that it would take about 20 years to complete the groundwater remediation, and the costs through completion were estimated to range from $42 to $52. As no amount within the range was a better estimate than
another, we recognized a pretax expense in fiscal 2006 of $42.0 as a component of income from discontinued operations and recorded an environmental accrual of $42.0 in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets. There has been no
change to the estimated exposure range related to the Pace facility.

We have implemented many of the remedial corrective
measures at the Pace, Florida facility required under 1995 Consent Orders issued by the FDEP and the USEPA. Contaminated soils have been bioremediated, and the treated soils have been secured in a lined on-site disposal cell. Several groundwater
recovery systems have been installed to contain and remove contamination from groundwater. We completed an extensive assessment of the site to determine how well existing measures are working, what additional corrective measures may be needed, and
whether newer remediation technologies that were not available in the 1990s might be suitable to more quickly and effectively remove groundwater contaminants. Based on assessment results, we completed a focused feasibility study that appears to have
identified new and alternative approaches that should more effectively remove contaminants and achieve the targeted remediation goals. We continue to review the new approaches with the FDEP.

P

IEDMONT

At 30 September 2013, $19.5 of the environmental accrual was related to the Piedmont site.

On 30 June 2008, we sold our Elkton, Maryland, and Piedmont, South Carolina, production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses. In
connection with the sale, we recognized a liability for retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at the Piedmont site. This site is under active remediation for contamination caused by an insolvent prior owner. The
sale of the site triggered expense recognition. Prior to the sale, remediation costs had been capitalized since they improved the property as compared to its condition when originally acquired. We are required by the South Carolina Department of
Health and Environmental Control to address both contaminated soil and groundwater. Numerous areas of soil contamination have been addressed, and contaminated groundwater is being recovered and treated. We estimate that it will take until 2017 to
complete source area remediation and another 15 years thereafter to complete groundwater recovery, with costs through completion estimated to be $24. We recognized a pretax expense in 2008 of $24.0 as a component of income from discontinued
operations and recorded an environmental liability of $24.0 in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets. There has been no change to the estimated exposure.

P

AULSBORO

At 30 September 2013, $6.1 of the environmental accrual was related to the Paulsboro site.

During the first quarter of 2009, management committed to a plan to sell the production facility in Paulsboro, New Jersey and recognized a $16.0 environmental liability associated with this site. The change in the
liability balance since it was established is a result of spending and changes in the estimated exposure. In December 2009, we completed the sale of this facility. We are required by the New Jersey state law to investigate and, if contaminated,
remediate a site upon its sale. We estimate that it will take several years to complete the investigation/remediation efforts at this site.

P

ASADENA

At 30 September 2013, $12.7 of the environmental
accrual was related to the Pasadena site.

During the fourth quarter of 2012, management committed to permanently
shutting down our PUI production facility in Pasadena, Texas. In shutting down and dismantling the facility, we will undertake certain remediation obligations related to soil and groundwater contaminants. We have been pumping and treating the
groundwater to control

off-site

migration of contaminated groundwater in compliance with regulatory requirements and under the approval of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). We estimate that
we will continue this program for



30 years subsequent to the shutdown of the PUI production facility. In addition, we will perform additional work to address other environmental obligations at the site. This additional work
includes addressing the RCRA permitted hazardous waste management units, investigating other potential solid waste management units, performing post closure care for two closed RCRA surface impoundment units and establishing engineering controls. In
2012, we estimated the total exposure at this site to be $13.0. There has been no change to the estimated exposure.

Asset Retirement Obligations

The Company’s asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with Tonnage Gases on-site long-term supply contracts, under which the Company has built a facility on land owned by the customer and is
obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The retirement of assets includes the contractually required removal of a long-lived asset from service, and encompasses the sale, removal, abandonment, recycling, or disposal of the
assets as required at the end of the contract terms. The timing and/or method of settlement of these obligations are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within our control.

Changes to the carrying amount of our asset retirement obligations are as follows:

These obligations are primarily reflected in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets.

Guarantees and Warranties

We are a party to certain guarantee agreements, including debt guarantees of equity affiliates and equity support agreements. These
guarantees are contingent commitments that are related to activities of our primary businesses.

We have guaranteed
repayment of some additional borrowings of certain unconsolidated equity affiliates. At 30 September 2013, these guarantees have terms in the range of one to eight years, with maximum potential payments of $4.7.

We have entered into an equity support agreement and operations guarantee related to an air separation facility constructed in
Trinidad for a venture in which we own 50%. At 30 September 2013, maximum potential payments under joint and several guarantees were $49.5. Exposures under the guarantee decline over time and will be completely extinguished by 2024.

To date, no equity contributions or payments have been required since the inception of these guarantees. The fair value of the above
guarantees is not material.

We, in the normal course of business operations, have issued product warranties in our
Equipment business. Also, contracts often contain standard terms and conditions which typically include a warranty and indemnification to the buyer that the goods and services purchased do not infringe on third-party intellectual property rights.
The provision for estimated future costs relating to warranties is not material to the consolidated financial statements.

We do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with guarantees and warranties will have a material adverse effect on
our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.

Put Option Agreements

In 2002, we entered into a put option agreement as part of the purchase of an additional interest in San Fu Gas Company, Ltd.,
renamed Air Products San Fu Company, Ltd. (San Fu), an industrial gas company in Taiwan. Currently, we have an ownership interest of 74% in San Fu. Put options were issued which give other shareholders the right to sell San Fu stock to us at market
price when exercised. The options are effective through January 2015 and allow for the sale of all stock owned by other shareholders to us. We account for put options as contingent



liabilities to purchase an asset. Since the inception of these agreements and through 30 September 2013, we determined that we were not certain that these options would be exercised by the
other shareholders. The estimated U.S. dollar price of purchasing the stock owned by other shareholders based on the exchange rate at 30 September 2013 would be approximately $275.

In July 2012, we entered into an agreement that provides the largest minority shareholder of Indura S.A. a right to exercise a put
option to require Air Products to purchase up to a 30.5% equity interest (approximately 16.3 million shares) during the two-year period beginning on 1 July 2015. We determined that the put option is embedded within minority interest shares
that are subject to the put option. Therefore, the put option is accounted for within “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest” in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, and Note 20, Noncontrolling Interests,
for further details.

Unconditional Purchase Obligations

We are obligated to make future payments under unconditional purchase obligations as summarized below:

Approximately $700 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply
for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the
term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations
would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

The unconditional purchase obligations
also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $625
for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2014.

18.  CAPITAL STOCK

Common Stock

Authorized common stock consists of 300 million shares with a par value of $1 per share. As of 30 September 2013,
249 million shares were issued, with 211 million outstanding.

On 15 September 2011, the Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We repurchase shares pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, through repurchase agreements established with
several brokers. During fiscal year 2013, we purchased 5.7 million of our outstanding shares at a cost of $461.6. At 30 September 2013, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains.

The following table reflects the changes in common shares:



Preferred Stock

Authorized preferred stock consists of 25 million shares with a par value of $1 per share, of which 2.5 million have been
designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in accordance with the Shareholder Rights Plan discussed below. At 30 September 2013, no shares of the preferred stock were issued or outstanding.

Shareholder Rights Plan

On 24 July 2013, the Board of Directors unanimously adopted a limited duration Shareholder Rights Plan under which common stockholders receive an associated right to purchase one one-thousandth
(1/1,000) of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. These rights will trade with the shares of our common stock and will be exercisable at a price of $300.00 in the event of certain changes in beneficial ownership of the
Company.

Under the Shareholder Rights Plan, the rights generally will become exercisable only if a person or group
acquires beneficial ownership of 10 percent (or 20 percent in the case of institutional investors filing on Schedule 13G) or more of our common stock in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors (an “Acquiring Person”). In that
situation, each holder of a right (other than the Acquiring Person) will have the right to purchase, at the exercise price, common shares having a market value equal to twice the exercise price. In addition, in the event of a merger or business
combination with the Acquiring Person, each holder of the right will thereafter have the right to purchase, at the exercise price, common shares of the Acquiring Person having a market value equal to twice the exercise price. The rights will expire
on 24 July 2014 unless redeemed earlier by the Company for $0.001 per right.

19.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

We have various share-based compensation programs, which include stock options, deferred stock units, and restricted stock. Under
all programs, the terms of the awards are fixed at the grant date. We issue shares from treasury stock upon the exercise of stock options, the payout of deferred stock units, and the issuance of restricted stock awards. As of
30 September 2013, there were 6,610,360 shares available for future grant under our Long-Term Incentive Plan, which is shareholder approved.

Share-based compensation cost recognized in the consolidated income statements is summarized below:

$27.7

Before-tax share-based compensation cost is primarily included in selling and administrative expense
on our consolidated income statements. The amount of share-based compensation cost capitalized in 2013, 2012, and 2011 was not material.

Total before-tax share-based compensation cost by type of program was as follows:



Stock Options

We have granted awards of options to purchase common stock to executives and selected employees. The exercise price of stock options
equals the market price of our stock on the date of the grant. Options generally vest incrementally over three years, and remain exercisable for ten years from the date of grant.

Fair values of stock options were estimated using a Black Scholes model that used the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected
volatility and expected dividend yield are based on actual historical experience of our stock and dividends over the historical period equal to the expected life. The expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to
be outstanding based on an analysis of Company-specific historical exercise data. The range given below results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different behavior. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior were
considered separately for valuation purposes. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Strips with terms equal to the expected time of exercise as of the grant date.

The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2013, 2012, and 2011 was
$19.85, $21.43, and $23.83, per option, respectively.

A summary of stock option activity is presented below:

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the amount by which our closing stock price of $106.57 as
of 30 September 2013 exceeds the exercise price multiplied by the number of in-the-money options outstanding or exercisable.

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $170.4, $110.6, and $180.8, respectively.

Compensation cost is generally recognized over the stated vesting period consistent with the terms of the arrangement (i.e., either
on a straight-line or graded-vesting basis). Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would meet the requirements for vesting of awards upon their retirement. As of 30 September 2013, there was $9.7 of
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.

Cash received from option exercises during 2013 was $226.4. The total tax benefit realized from stock option exercises in 2013 was $61.6, of which $34.0 was the excess tax benefit.



Deferred Stock Units and Restricted Stock

The grant-date fair value of deferred stock units and restricted stock is estimated on the date of grant based on the market price
of the stock, and compensation cost is generally amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period during which employees perform related services. Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would
meet the requirements for vesting of awards upon their retirement.

Deferred Stock Units

We have granted deferred stock units to executives, selected employees, and outside directors. These deferred stock units entitle
the recipient to one share of common stock upon vesting, which is conditioned on continued employment during the deferral period and may also be conditioned on achieving certain performance targets. The deferral period for some units ends after
death, disability, or retirement. The deferral period for other performance-based deferred stock units ends at the end of the performance period (one to three years). Additionally, we have granted deferred stock units, subject to a three-, four-, or
five-year deferral period, to selected employees. Deferred stock units issued to directors are paid after service on the Board of Directors ends at the time elected by the director (not to exceed 10 years after service ends).

Cash payments made for deferred stock units were $1.9, $1.8, and $1.0 in 2013, 2012, and 2011,
respectively. As of 30 September 2013, there was $24.3 of unrecognized compensation cost related to deferred stock units. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years. The total fair value of deferred
stock units paid out during 2013, 2012, and 2011, including shares vested in prior periods, was $32.3, $22.0, and $26.3, respectively.

Restricted Stock

We have issued shares of restricted stock to certain
officers. Participants are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares. Shares granted since 2007 vest in four years or upon earlier retirement, death, or disability. Shares granted prior to 2007 are subject to forfeiture if
employment is terminated other than due to death, disability, or retirement. The shares are nontransferable while subject to forfeiture.

As of 30 September 2013, there was $1.9 of unrecognized compensation cost related to
restricted stock awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years. The total fair value of restricted stock vested during 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $4.4, $2.0, and $1.6, respectively.



20.  NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

INDURA S.A.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

The largest minority shareholder in Indura
S.A. has the right to exercise a put option to require us to purchase up to a 30.5% equity interest during the two-year period beginning on 1 July 2015, at a redemption value equal to fair market value (subject to a minimum price based upon the
acquisition date value escalated by an inflation factor). We determined that the put option is embedded within the minority interest shares that are subject to the put option. The redemption feature requires classification of the minority
shareholder’s interest in the consolidated balance sheet outside of equity under the caption “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest.”

The redeemable noncontrolling interest of Indura S.A. was recorded on the acquisition date based on the estimated fair value of the shares including the embedded put option. As Indura S.A. shares are not publicly
traded, the fair value of the shares was estimated based on trading multiples for similar companies in the Chilean stock market and recent transactions. The fair value of the put option was estimated using standard equity option pricing techniques,
expected dividend payouts, and assumptions that market participants would use regarding equity volatility and the risk-free rate of return. Subsequent adjustments to the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest due to the redemption feature,
if any, will be recognized as they occur and recorded within capital in excess of par value.

The following is a
rollforward of the redeemable noncontrolling interest:

As redeemable noncontrolling interest is not part of total equity, the impacts above are excluded
from our consolidated statements of equity.

21.  EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS):



Diluted EPS attributable to Air Products reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if stock options or other share-based awards were exercised or converted into common stock. The dilutive effect is computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes all share-based awards are exercised and the hypothetical proceeds from
exercise are used by the Company to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The incremental shares (difference between shares assumed to be issued versus purchased), to the extent they would have been dilutive, are
included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation. Options on 2.1 million shares, 3.6 million shares, and 2.1 million shares were antidilutive and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for 2013, 2012, and
2011, respectively.

22.  INCOME TAXES

The following table summarizes the income of U.S. and foreign operations before taxes:

The following table shows the components of the provision for income taxes:

A reconciliation of the differences between the United States federal statutory tax rate and the
effective tax rate is as follows:

Income tax payments, net of refunds, were $325.5 in 2013, $255.7 in 2012, and $159.9 in 2011.



The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are included within the consolidated financial statements as
follows:

The increase in net deferred income tax liability primarily resulted from decreases in liability
associated with retirement benefits. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, for additional information.

Foreign and
state loss carryforwards as of 30 September 2013 were $154.9 and $301.0, respectively. As of 30 September 2013, foreign tax credits and other tax carryforwards were $46.9, and U.S. tax credits were $19.7. Unused foreign loss carryforwards,
tax credits, and other tax carryforwards of $117.9 have expiration periods that range from 2014 to 2023; the remainder have unlimited carryforward periods. State loss carryforwards have expiration periods that range between fiscal years 2014 and
2033, and U.S. tax credits mainly expire in 2023.

The net change in the valuation allowance was an increase of $8.1 for
the year ended 30 September 2013. The valuation allowance as of 30 September 2013 primarily relates to the foreign and state loss carryforwards, tax credits, and other tax carryforwards referenced above. If events warrant the reversal of
the $44.7 valuation allowance, it would result in a reduction of tax expense. We believe it is more likely than not that future earnings will be sufficient to utilize our deferred tax asset, net of existing valuation allowance, at 30 September
2013.

We record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures
unless those earnings are permanently reinvested in the companies that produced them. These cumulative undistributed earnings that are considered to be permanently reinvested in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures are included in
retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets and amounted to $5,524.9 as of 30 September 2013. An estimated $1,400.3 in U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes would be due if these



earnings were remitted as dividends after payment of all deferred taxes. As more than 90% of the undistributed earnings are in countries with a statutory tax rate of 24% or higher, we do not
generate a disproportionate amount of taxable income in countries with very low tax rates.

A reconciliation of the
beginning and ending amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

At 30 September 2013 and 2012, we had $124.3 and $110.8 of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding
interest and penalties, of which $63.1 and $56.9, respectively, would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.

Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as a component of income tax expense and totaled $2.4 in
2013, $(26.1) in 2012, and $(2.4) in 2011. Our accrued balance for interest and penalties was $8.1 and $7.2 in 2013 and 2012, respectively.

We were challenged by the Spanish tax authorities over income tax deductions taken by certain of our Spanish subsidiaries during fiscal years 2005–2011. In November 2011, we reached a settlement with the
Spanish tax authorities for

€

41.3 million ($56) in resolution of all tax issues under examination. This settlement increased our
income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2012 by $43.8 ($.20 per share) and had a 3.3% impact on our effective tax rate. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $6.4 for tax
positions taken in prior years and $11.0 for settlements.

On 25 January 2012, the Spanish Supreme Court released
its decision in favor of our Spanish subsidiary related to certain tax transactions for years 1991 and 1992, a period before we controlled this subsidiary. As a result, in the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of
$58.3 ($.27 per share), resulting in a 4.4% reduction in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2012. As a result of this ruling, we recorded a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $38.3 for tax positions taken in
prior years.

During the third quarter of 2012, our unrecognized tax benefits increased $33.3 as a result of certain tax
positions taken in conjunction with the disposition of our Homecare business. When resolved, these benefits will be recognized in “Income from discontinued operations, net of tax” on our consolidated income statements and will not impact
our effective tax rate. For additional information, see Note 3, Discontinued Operations.

In the third
quarter of 2011, a U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit over tax years 2007 and 2008 was completed, resulting in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $36.0 and a favorable impact to earnings of $23.9. This included a tax benefit
of $8.9 ($.04 per share) recognized in income from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2011, as it relates to the previously divested U.S. Healthcare business.

We are also currently under examination in a number of tax jurisdictions, some of which may be resolved in the next twelve months.
As a result, it is reasonably possible that a change in the unrecognized tax benefits may occur during the next twelve months. However, quantification of an estimated range cannot be made at this time.



We generally remain subject to examination in the following major tax jurisdictions
for the years indicated below:



23.  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION



Advisory Costs

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we incurred legal and other advisory fees of $10.1 ($6.4 after-tax, or $.03 per share) in
connection with our response to the rapid acquisition of a large position in shares of our common stock by Pershing Square Capital Management LLC and its affiliates (Pershing Square). These fees, which are reflected on the consolidated income
statements as “Advisory Costs,” include costs incurred before and after Pershing Square’s disclosure of its holdings and cover advisory services related to the adoption of the Shareholders Rights Plan, preparation for a potential
proxy solicitation campaign, and entering into an agreement with Pershing Square.

Customer Bankruptcy

As a result of events which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized a charge of $9.8 ($6.1 after-tax, or $.03 per
share) primarily related to the write-off of on-site assets due to a customer bankruptcy and mill shutdown. The customer, which primarily received products from the Tonnage Gases segment, filed for bankruptcy in May 2012. Sales and operating income
associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment’s results. We do not expect to recognize additional charges related to this customer.

25.  BUSINESS SEGMENT AND
GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Our segments are organized based on differences in product and/or type of customer. We have
four business segments consisting of Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy.

Merchant Gases

The Merchant Gases segment sells atmospheric gases such as
oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air); process gases such as hydrogen and helium (purchased or refined from crude helium); and medical and specialty gases, along with certain services and equipment,
throughout the world to customers in many industries, including those in metals, glass, chemical processing, food processing, healthcare, general manufacturing, and petroleum and natural gas industries. The principal types of products are liquid
bulk, packaged gases and hardgoods, and small on-site plants. Most merchant product is delivered via bulk supply, in liquid or gaseous form, by tanker or tube trailer. Smaller quantities of industrial and specialty gases are delivered in cylinders
and dewars as “packaged gases,” or through small on-sites (cryogenic or noncryogenic generators). Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. Natural gas is also an energy source at a number of our
Merchant Gases facilities. We mitigate energy and natural gas prices through pricing formulas and surcharges. The Merchant Gases segment also includes our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method. The
largest of these joint ventures operate in Mexico, Italy, South Africa, India, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand. Merchant Gases competes worldwide against global industrial gas companies and several regional sellers. Competition in industrial gases is
based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications.

Tonnage Gases

Tonnage Gases provides hydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, oxygen, and syngas principally to the energy production
and refining, chemical, and metallurgical industries worldwide. For large-volume, or “tonnage” industrial gas users, we either construct a gas plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility—hence the term
“on-site”—or deliver product through a pipeline from a nearby location. We are the world’s largest provider of hydrogen, which is used by refiners to lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels to reduce smog and ozone
depletion. Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases, and natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas production. We mitigate energy and natural gas price changes through
long-term cost pass-through type contracts. Tonnage Gases competes against global industrial gas companies, as well as regional competitors. Competition is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, the development of applications that use
industrial gases and, in some cases, provision of other services or products such as power and steam generation. We also derive a competitive advantage in regions where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to provide reliable and economic
supply of products to customers.

Electronics and Performance Materials

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment employs applications technology to provide solutions to a broad range of global
industries through expertise in chemical synthesis, analytical technology, process engineering, and surface science. This segment provides specialty and tonnage gases, specialty chemicals, services, and equipment to the electronics industry
primarily for the manufacture of silicon and compound semiconductors as well as liquid crystal (LCD) and other displays. The segment also provides performance chemical solutions for the coatings, inks, adhesives, civil engineering, personal care,
institutional and industrial cleaning, mining, oil field, polyurethane, and other industries. The Electronics and Performance Materials segment faces competition on a product-by-product basis against competitors ranging from niche suppliers with a
single product to large, vertically integrated companies. Competition is principally conducted on the basis of price, quality, product performance, reliability of product supply, technical innovation, service, and global infrastructure.

Equipment and Energy

The Equipment and Energy segment designs and manufactures cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas liquefaction (LNG), and helium distribution,
and serves energy markets in a variety of ways. Equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries,



including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing. Energy markets are served through our operation and partial
ownership of cogeneration and flue gas desulfurization facilities. In addition, we are developing hydrogen as an energy carrier, waste-to-energy facilities to produce electricity, carbon capture technologies for a variety of industrial and power
applications, and oxygen-based technologies to serve energy markets in the future. Equipment and Energy competes with a large number of firms for all of its offerings except LNG heat exchangers, for which there are fewer competitors due to the
limited market size and proprietary technologies. Competition is based primarily on technological performance, service, technical know-how, price, and performance guarantees.

Other

Other operating income (loss) includes other expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses and costs previously allocated to
businesses now reported as discontinued operations. Also included are LIFO inventory adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO and the LIFO pool adjustments are not allocated to the business segments.

Other assets include cash, deferred tax assets, pension assets, financial instruments, and corporate assets previously allocated to
businesses now reported as discontinued operations.

Customers

We do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market, and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of our consolidated
revenues.

Accounting Policies

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies. We evaluate the
performance of segments based upon reported segment operating income. Operating income of the business segments includes general corporate expenses. Intersegment sales are not material and are recorded at selling prices that approximate market
prices. Equipment manufactured for our industrial gas business is generally transferred at cost and not reflected as an intersegment sale.

Business Segment

(A)

Includes the gain on remeasuring our previously held equity interest in DA
NanoMaterials. For additional information, see Note 5, Business Combinations.

(B)

Information about how the charges related to the businesses at the segment level is
discussed in Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans.

(C)

Includes stranded costs resulting from discontinued operations.



Business Segment

(A)

Includes plant and equipment.



Geographic Information

(A)

Long-lived assets include plant and equipment, net.

Geographic information is based on country of origin. Included in
United States revenues are export sales to

third-party

customers of $410.3 in 2013, $521.1 in 2012, and $537.3 in 2011. The Europe region operates principally in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland,
Spain, and the U.K. The Asia region operates principally in China, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. The Latin America region operates principally in Brazil and Chile.

performance targets.



(2)

Represents authorized shares that were available for future grants as of
30 September 2013. These shares may be used for options, deferred stock units, restricted stock, and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, and key employees. Full value awards such as restricted stock are limited to 20% of cumulative
awards after 1 October 2001.

(3)

This number represents deferred stock units issued under the Deferred Compensation
Plan, which are purchased for the fair market value of the underlying shares of stock with eligible deferred compensation.

The following equity compensation plans or programs were not approved
by shareholders. All of these plans have either been discontinued or do not require shareholder approval because participants forego current compensation equal to the full market value of any share units credited under the plans.

Deferred Compensation Plan

—The Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded employee retirement benefit plan
available to certain of the Company’s U.S.-based management and other highly compensated employees (and those of its subsidiaries) who receive awards under the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan, which is the annual cash bonus plan for
executives and key salaried employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Because participants forego current compensation to “purchase” deferred stock units for full value under the Plan, it is not required to be approved by shareholders
under the NYSE listing standards. Under the Plan, participants may defer a portion of base salary (elective deferrals) which cannot be contributed to the Company’s Retirement Savings Plan, a 401(k) and profit-sharing plan offered to all
salaried employees (RSP), because of tax limitations and earn matching contributions from the Company that they would have received if their elective deferrals had been contributed to the RSP (matching credits). In addition, participants in the Plan
may defer all or a portion of their bonus awards under the Annual Incentive Plan (bonus deferrals) under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Finally, certain participants under the Plan who participate in the profit-sharing component of the RSP rather
than the Company’s salaried pension plans receive contribution credits under the Plan which are a percentage ranging from 4%-6%, based on their years of service, of their salary in excess of tax limitations and their bonus awards under the
Annual Incentive Plan (contribution credits). The dollar amount of elective deferrals, matching credits, bonus deferrals, and contribution credits is initially credited to an unfunded account, which earns interest credits. Participants are
periodically permitted while employed by the Company to irrevocably convert all or a portion of their interest-bearing account to deferred stock units in a Company stock account. Upon conversion, the Company stock account is credited with deferred
stock units based on the fair market value of a share of Company stock on the date of crediting. Dividend equivalents corresponding to the number of units are credited quarterly to the interest-bearing account. Deferred stock units generally are
paid after termination of employment in shares of Company stock.

The Deferred Compensation Plan was formerly known as
the Supplementary Savings Plan. The name was changed in 2006 when the deferred bonus program, previously administered under the Annual Incentive Plan, was merged into this Plan.

The information set forth in the sections headed “Persons Owning More than 5% of Air Products Stock as of September 30,
