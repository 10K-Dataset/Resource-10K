GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation originally founded in
1940, serves technology, energy, industrial and healthcare customers globally with a unique
portfolio of products, services and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty
gases, performance materials, equipment and services. The Company is the world’s largest supplier
of hydrogen and helium and has built leading positions in growth markets such as semiconductor
materials, refinery hydrogen, natural gas liquefaction, and advanced coatings and adhesives. As
used in this Report, unless the context indicates otherwise, the term “Company” includes
subsidiaries and predecessors of the registrant and its subsidiaries.

The Company manages its operations, assesses performance and reports earnings under six business
segments: Merchant Gases; Tonnage Gases; Electronics and Performance Materials; Equipment and
Energy; Healthcare; and Chemicals. The Company previously managed its operations and reported
results under three business segments: Gases, Chemicals and Equipment.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

Financial information concerning the Company’s six business segments appears in Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein, which information and all other
specific references herein to information appearing in the 2007 Financial Review Section of the
Annual Report are incorporated herein by reference.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENTS

MERCHANT GASES

Merchant Gases sells industrial gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and argon (primarily recovered by
the cryogenic distillation of air), hydrogen and helium (purchased or refined from crude helium),
and certain medical and specialty gases throughout the world to customers in many industries,
including those in metals, glass, chemical processing, food processing, medical gases, steel,
general manufacturing and petroleum and natural gas industries.

Merchant Gases delivers its products by one of the following three methods:

(1)

“liquid bulk”

— under which product is delivered in bulk (in liquid or gaseous form) by
tanker or tube trailer and stored, usually in its liquid state, in equipment designed and
installed by the Company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed.
Liquid bulk sales are typically governed by three-to-five year contracts;

(2)

“packaged gases”

— under which small quantities of product are delivered in either
cylinders or dewars. The Company operates packaged gas businesses in Europe, Asia and Brazil; in
the United States, its packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and
magnetic resonance imaging (principally helium) industries; and

(3)

“small on-site plants”

— under which customers receive product through small on-sites
(cryogenic or non-cryogenic generators) either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the
equipment to the customer.

Electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases — oxygen,
nitrogen and argon. Natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the Company’s Merchant
Gases facilities. The Company mitigates energy and natural gas prices through pricing formulas and
surcharges. A shortage or interruption of electricity or natural gas supply, or a price increase
that cannot be passed through to customers, possibly for competitive reasons, may adversely affect
the operations or results of Merchant Gases. During fiscal year 2007, no significant difficulties
were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials. Shortages of argon and
helium did limit further growth in our Merchant Gases segment in fiscal year 2007.

Merchant Gases competes in the United States against three global industrial gas companies, L’Air
Liquide S.A., Linde AG and Praxair, Inc., and several regional sellers (including Airgas, Inc.).
Competition is based primarily on price, reliability of supply and the development of applications
for use of industrial gases. Similar competitive situations exist in
the European



and Asian industrial gas markets in which the Company competes against the three
global companies as well as regional competitors.

Sales of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen and argon) constituted approximately 17 percent of the
Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2007, 18 percent in fiscal year 2006 and 17 percent in
fiscal year 2005.

TONNAGE GASES

Tonnage Gases provides hydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, oxygen and syngas principally to the
petroleum refining, chemical and metallurgical industries worldwide. Gases are produced at large
facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally-located
production facilities and are generally governed by contracts with fifteen-to-twenty year terms.
The Company is the world’s largest provider of hydrogen, which is used by oil refiners to
facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and
diesel fuels to reduce smog and ozone depletion. The metallurgical industry utilizes nitrogen for
inerting and oxygen for the manufacture of steel and certain non-ferrous metals, and the chemical
industry uses hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide and syngas (a hydrogen-carbon monoxide
mixture) as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals. The Company delivers product
through pipelines from centrally located facilities in or near the Texas Gulf Coast; Los Angeles,
California; Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; Alberta, Canada; Rotterdam, the Netherlands;
Ulsan, Korea; Tangshan, China; Kuan Yin, Taiwan; Singapore; and Camaçari, Brazil. The Company owns
less than controlling interests in pipelines located in Thailand, Singapore and South Africa.

Electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. Natural gas is
also an energy source at a number of Tonnage Gases facilities. The Company mitigates energy and
natural gas prices through long-term cost pass-through contracts. Natural gas is the principal raw
material for hydrogen, carbon monoxide and syngas production. During fiscal year 2007, no
significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw
materials.

Tonnage Gases competes in the United States against three global industrial gas companies, L’Air
Liquide S.A., Linde AG and Praxair, Inc., and several regional sellers. Competition is based
primarily on price, reliability of supply, the development of applications that use industrial
gases and, in some cases, provision of other services or products such as power and steam
generation. Similar competitive situations exist in the European and Asian industrial gas markets
where the Company competes against the three global companies as well as regional competitors.

Tonnage Gases hydrogen sales constituted approximately 15 percent of the Company’s consolidated
sales in fiscal year 2007, 15 percent in fiscal year 2006 and 12 percent in fiscal year 2005.

ELECTRONICS AND PERFORMANCE MATERIALS

Electronics and Performance Materials employs applications technology to provide solutions to a
broad range of global industries through chemical synthesis, analytical technology, process
engineering and surface science. This segment provides the electronics industry with specialty
gases (such as nitrogen trifluoride, silane, arsine, phosphine, white ammonia, silicon
tetrafluoride, carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoromethane, critical etch gases and tungsten
hexafluoride), as well as tonnage gases (primarily nitrogen), specialty and bulk chemicals,
services and equipment for the manufacture of silicon and compound semiconductors, thin film
transistor liquid crystal displays and photovoltaic devices. These products are delivered through
various supply chain methods, including bulk delivery systems or distribution by pipelines such as
those located in California’s Silicon Valley; Phoenix, Arizona; Tainon, Taiwan; Gumi and Giheung,
Korea; and Tianjin and Shanghai, China. The Company has announced that the High Process Purity
Chemicals business will be sold during fiscal year 2008.

Electronics and Performance Materials also provides performance materials for a wide range of
products, including coatings, inks, adhesives, civil engineering, personal care, institutional and
industrial cleaning, mining, oil refining and polyurethanes, and focuses on the development of new
materials aimed at providing unique functionality to emerging markets. Principal performance
materials include polyurethane catalysts and other additives for polyurethane foam, epoxy amine
curing agents and auxiliary products for epoxy systems and specialty surfactants for formulated
systems.

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials, including
alcohols, ethyleneamines, cyclohexamine, acrylonitriles and glycols. During fiscal year 2007, no
significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw
materials.

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment faces competition on a product-by-product basis
against competitors ranging from niche suppliers with a single product to larger and more
vertically integrated companies. Competition is
principally conducted on the basis of price, quality, product performance, reliability of product
supply, technical innovation, service and global infrastructure.



Total sales from Electronics and Performance Materials constituted approximately 21 percent of the
Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2007, 21 percent in fiscal year 2006 and 21 percent in
fiscal year 2005.

EQUIPMENT AND ENERGY

Equipment and Energy designs and manufactures cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air
separation (utilizing membrane technology and adsorption technology), hydrocarbon recovery and
purification, natural gas liquefaction (known as “LNG”) and helium distribution (cryogenic
transportation containers), and serves energy markets in a variety of ways.

Equipment is sold globally to customers in the chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and
gas recovery and processing and steel and primary metals processing industries. The segment also
provides a broad range of plant design, engineering, procurement and construction management
services to its customers.

Energy markets are served through the Company’s operation and partial ownership of cogeneration and
flue gas desulphurization facilities and its development of hydrogen as an energy carrier and
oxygen-based technologies to serve energy markets in the future. The Company owns and operates a
cogeneration facility in Calvert City, Kentucky; operates and owns fifty percent interests in a
49-megawatt fluidized-bed coal-fired power generation facility in Stockton, California and a
24-megawatt gas-fired combined-cycle power generation facility near Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and
operates and owns a 48.8 percent interest in a 112-megawatt gas-fueled power generation facility in
Thailand. The Company also operates and owns a fifty percent interest in a flue gas
desulphurization facility in Indiana.

Steel, aluminum and capital equipment subcomponents (compressors, etc.) are the principal raw
materials in the equipment portion of this segment. Adequate raw materials for individual projects
are acquired under firm purchase agreements. Coal, petroleum coke and natural gas are the largest
cost components in the production of energy. The Company mitigates these cost components, in part,
through long-term cost-pass-through contracts. During fiscal year 2007, no significant difficulties
were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials.

Equipment and Energy competes with a great number of firms for all of its offerings except LNG heat
exchangers, for which there are fewer competitors due to the limited market size and proprietary
technologies. Competition is based primarily on technological performance, service, technical
know-how, price and performance guarantees.

The backlog of equipment orders (including letters of intent believed to be firm) from third party
customers (including equity affiliates) was approximately $258 million on 30 September 2007,
approximately 42 percent of which is for cryogenic air separation equipment and 27 percent of which
is for LNG heat exchangers, as compared with a total backlog of approximately $446 million on 30
September 2006. The Company expects that approximately $225 million of the backlog on 30 September
2007 will be completed during fiscal year 2008.

HEALTHCARE

Healthcare provides respiratory therapies, home medical equipment and infusion services to over
500,000 patients in their homes. The Company operates in fifteen countries, including the United
States, and is the market leader in Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Mexico. Its serves
patients whose conditions include chronic lung disease, asthma, emphysema, sleep apnea and diabetes
by providing oxygen therapy, pharmacist-managed direct-shipped respiratory medications, home
nebulizer therapy, sleep management therapy, anti-infection therapy, enteral nutrition, beds and
wheelchairs.

Labor is the largest cost component in this segment. In addition, the Company purchases oxygen
concentrators and cylinders, beds, wheelchairs, sleep apnea products and equipment for respiratory
therapy from multiple vendors.

The home healthcare market is highly competitive. Competition in the Company’s Healthcare segment
involves regulatory compliance, price, quality, service and reliability of supply. Home healthcare
in the United States is served by over 2,000 regional and local providers, including Apria
Healthcare Group and Lincare Holdings Inc. Reimbursement levels are established by fee schedules
regulated by Medicare and Medicaid or by the levels negotiated with insurance companies.
Accordingly, in the United States, home healthcare companies compete primarily on the basis of
service. The structure of home healthcare in Europe is different from that in the United States. In
certain countries in Europe, competitive bidding leads to exclusive supply arrangements for fixed
terms. In other European countries, a licensed home healthcare provider competes for customers in a
manner similar to that in the U.S. Three large industrial gas companies,
L’Air Liquide S.A., Linde AG, and Praxair, Inc., represent Healthcare’s principal competitors in
Europe. Maintaining competitiveness requires efficient logistics, reimbursement and accounts
receivable systems.



CHEMICALS

The Chemicals segment consists of the Polymer Emulsions business and the Polyurethane Intermediates
(PUI) business. The Company announced plans to divest its Polymer Emulsions business in 2006 and
is currently in advanced discussions with its partner in the business, Wacker Chemie AG, over
Wacker’s purchase of the Company’s interests in their two polymers joint ventures.

Polymers are water-based and water-soluble emulsion products derived primarily from vinyl acetate
monomer. The Company’s major emulsions products are AIRFLEX

®

vinyl acetate-ethylene copolymer
emulsions and vinyl acetate homopolymer emulsions, which are used in adhesives, nonwoven fabric
binders, paper coatings, paints, inks and carpet backing binder formulations.

The Company produces di-nitrotoluene (“DNT”), which is converted to toluene diamine (“TDA”) and
sold for use as an intermediate in the manufacture of a major precursor of flexible polyurethane
foam used in furniture cushioning, carpet underlay, bedding and seating in automobiles. Most of the
Company’s TDA is sold under long-term contracts to a small number of customers.

The Company employs proprietary technology and scale of production to differentiate its
polyurethane intermediates from those of its competitors. The Company also produces nitric acid as
a raw material for its intermediates.

The Chemicals segment’s principal raw material purchases are chemical intermediates produced by
others from basic petrochemical feedstocks such as olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons, which are
generally derived from various crude oil fractions or from liquids extracted from natural gas. The
Company purchases its chemical intermediates, which are generally readily available, from many
sources and normally is not dependent on one supplier. The Company uses such raw materials in the
production of emulsions and polyurethane intermediates. In addition, the Company purchases finished
and semi-finished materials and chemical intermediates from many suppliers. The Company also
purchases ammonia under long-term contracts as a feedstock for its Pasadena, Texas facility. During
fiscal year 2007, there was a shortage of a key polymers raw material, vinyl acetate monomer,
however, the business was able to obtain adequate supplies. There were no other significant
difficulties in supplying adequate supplies of energy or raw materials.

The Chemicals segment competes against a number of chemical companies, some of which are larger and
more vertically integrated than the Company. While competition varies from product to product, the
Company believes it has strong market positions in most of its chemical products. The possibility
of back integration by large customers is a major competitive factor in the Company’s polyurethane
intermediates business. Competition is conducted principally on the basis of price, quality,
product performance, reliability of product supply and technical service assistance.

Chemicals sales constituted 10 percent of the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2007, 10
percent in fiscal year 2006 and 12 percent in fiscal year 2005.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS GENERALLY

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

The Company, through subsidiaries, affiliates and minority-owned ventures, conducts business in
over forty countries outside the United States. Its international businesses are subject to risks
customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates and controls, import and export controls and other economic, political and regulatory
policies of local governments.

The Company has majority or wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in Canada, 17 European
countries (including the United Kingdom and Spain), 11 Asian countries (including China, Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan) and four Latin American countries (including Mexico and Brazil). The Company
also owns less-than-controlling interests in entities operating in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin
America (including Italy, Germany, China, Korea, India, Singapore, Thailand, South Africa and
Mexico).

Financial information about the Company’s foreign operations and investments is included in Notes
8, 17 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein. Information
about foreign currency translation is included under “Foreign Currency” in Note 1 and information
on the Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations is included under “Currency Risk Management” in
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein and in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under “Foreign Currency
Exchange Rate Risk” included under Item 7 herein. Export sales from operations in the United States
to unconsolidated customers amounted to $715 million, $732 million and $714 million in fiscal years
2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Total export sales in fiscal year 2007 included $422 million in export sales to
affiliated



customers. The sales to affiliated customers were primarily equipment sales within the
Equipment and Energy segment and Electronic and Performance Materials sales.

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

The Company pursues a market-oriented approach to technology development through research and
development, engineering and commercial development processes. It conducts research and development
principally in its laboratories located in the United States (Trexlertown, Pennsylvania; Carlsbad,
California; Milton, Wisconsin; and Phoenix, Arizona), the United Kingdom (Basingstoke, London and
Carrington); Germany (Burghausen and Hamburg); the Netherlands (Utrecht); Spain (Barcelona and
Madrid) and Asia (Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China; Giheung, Korea; and Hsinchu, Taiwan). The Company
also funds and cooperates in research and development programs conducted by a number of major
universities and undertakes research work funded by others — principally the United States
Government.

The Company’s corporate research groups, which include materials, process and analytical centers,
support the research efforts of various businesses throughout the Company. Technology development
efforts for use within Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases and Equipment and Energy focus primarily on
new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases and
new or improved applications for all such products. Research and technology development for
Electronics and Performance Materials is primarily concerned with new products and applications to
strengthen and extend the Company’s present positions. Work is also performed in Electronics and
Performance Materials to lower processing costs and develop new processes for the new products. In
Healthcare, the Company employs new scientific developments, knowledge, clinical evidence or
technology to develop new products and services that focus on both the clinical and home healthcare
environment.

Research and development expenditures were $140 million during fiscal year 2007, $151 million in
fiscal year 2006 and $132 million in fiscal year 2005, and the Company expended $19 million on
customer-sponsored research activities during fiscal year 2007, $21 million during fiscal year 2006
and $17 million in fiscal year 2005.

As of 1 November 2007, the Company owned 1,031 United States patents and 2,912 foreign patents and
is a licensee under certain patents owned by others. While the patents and licenses are considered
important, the Company does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon
any particular patent, patent license or group of patents or licenses.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS

The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it
has operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures
and costs. From time to time the Company is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state
laws and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain
sites for investigation and possible cleanup. Additional information with respect to these
proceedings is included under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, below. The Company’s accounting policies
on environmental expenditures are discussed in Note 1 and particulars on environmental loss
contingencies are provided in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
8 herein.

The amounts charged to income from continuing operations on an after-tax basis related to
environmental matters totaled $25 million in fiscal 2007, $26 million in 2006 and $26 million in
2005. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws,
remedial activities and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Such costs are
estimated to be $21 million in 2008 and $22 million in 2009.

Although precise amounts are difficult to define, the Company estimates that in fiscal year 2007 it
spent approximately $11 million on capital projects to control pollution versus $14 million in
2006. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately $10
million in 2008 and $6 million in 2009. The cost of any environmental compliance generally is
contractually passed through to the customer.

The Company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it
is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $52 million to a reasonably
possible upper exposure of $65 million. The accrual on the balance sheet for 30 September 2007 was
$52.2 million and for 30 September 2006 was $52.4 million. Actual costs to be incurred in future
periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental
exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company does
not expect that any sum it may
have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed
above would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations in
any one year.



INSURANCE

The Company’s policy is to obtain public liability and property insurance coverage that is
currently available at what management determines to be a fair and reasonable price. The Company
maintains public liability and property insurance coverage at amounts that management believes are
sufficient to meet the Company’s anticipated needs in light of historical experience to cover
future litigation and claims. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will not incur
losses beyond the limits of, or outside the coverage of, its insurance.

EMPLOYEES

On 30 September 2007, the Company (including majority-owned subsidiaries) had approximately 22,100
employees, of whom approximately 21,500 were full-time employees and of whom approximately 11,200
were located outside the United States. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with
unions at various locations that expire on various dates over the next four years. The Company
considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory and does not believe that the impact of
any expiring or expired collective bargaining agreements will result in a material adverse impact
on the Company.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

The Company operates in over 40 countries around the world and faces a variety of risks and
uncertainties that could materially affect its future operations and financial performance. Many of
these risks and uncertainties are not within the Company’s control. Risks that may significantly
impact the Company include the following:

Overall Economic Conditions and Demand for Products — General economic conditions in markets in
which the Company does business can impact the demand for its goods and services. Decreased demand
for its products and services can have a negative impact on the Company’s financial performance and
cash flow.

Demand for the Company’s products and services in part depends on the general economic conditions
affecting the countries and industries in which the Company does business. A downturn in economic
conditions in a country or industry served by the Company may negatively impact demand for the
Company’s products and services, in turn negatively impacting the Company’s operations and
financial results. Further, changes in demand for its products and services can magnify the impact
of economic cycles on the Company’s businesses. Unanticipated contract terminations by current
customers can negatively impact operations, financial results and cash flow. The Company’s recent
divestiture of certain of its chemicals businesses, along with the potential sale of its polymers
business, should make the Company less susceptible to the cyclical nature of the chemicals
industry.

Competition — The Company faces strong competition from several large, global competitors and many
smaller regional ones in most of its business segments. Inability to compete effectively in a
segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.

The Merchant Gases segment competes with three global industrial gas companies, L’Air Liquide S.A.,
Linde AG and Praxair, Inc., as well as with several regional competitors in North America
(including Airgas, Inc.) and in Europe and Asia. Competition is based primarily on price, product
quality, reliability of supply and development of innovative applications.

The Tonnage Gases segment also competes with the three global industrial gas competitors noted
above as well as with several regional competitors in North America, Europe and Asia. Competition
is based primarily on price, product quality, reliability of supply, development of innovative
applications and, in some instances, provision of additional items such as power and steam
generation.

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment faces competition on a product-by-product basis
against companies ranging from niche suppliers with a single product to larger and more vertically
integrated companies. Competition is principally conducted on the basis of price, quality, product
performance, reliability of product supply and technical service assistance.

Equipment and Energy competes against many firms based primarily on technological performance,
service, technical know-how, price and performance guarantees.

Healthcare competes against many local and regional providers in the United States, including Apria
Healthcare Group and Lincare Holdings Inc., and against three large industrial gas companies, L’Air
Liquide, S.A., Linde AG and Praxair, Inc., as well as local and regional suppliers in Europe.
Competition is based primarily on quality of service. Remaining competitive requires efficient
logistic, reimbursement and accounts receivable systems.

The Chemicals segment competes against a large number of chemical companies, generally on a
product-by-product basis, principally on the basis of price, quality, product performance,
reliability of product supply and technical service assistance. Several of these competitors are
larger than the Company and are more vertically integrated.

Raw Material and Energy Cost and Availability — Volatility in raw material and energy costs,
interruption in ordinary sources of supply and an inability to recover unanticipated increases in
energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or significantly increase
the cost of doing business.



Electricity is the largest cost input for the production of atmospheric gases in Merchant Gases and
Tonnage Gases. Because the Company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of
electricity, energy price fluctuations could materially impact the financial performance of these
segments. While the Company has been successful in contracting for electricity under multi-year
agreements and passing through the cost to its customers, there is no assurance that it will be
able to do so in the future.

Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen,
carbon monoxide and synthesis gas within Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases. Volatility in
hydrocarbon prices can impact the Company’s financial performance. While the Company generally
passes this risk through to its customers under its take-or-pay contracts by matching feedstock
prices to the purchase price of the product being produced, an inability to do so in the future
could impact its financial results.

The Company’s large delivery truck fleet requires a readily available supply of gasoline and diesel
fuel. The Company attempts to pass through increases in the cost of these fuels to its customers
whenever possible.

Steel, aluminum and capital equipment subcomponents (such as compressors) are the principal raw
materials in the equipment portion of the Equipment and Energy segment. Firm purchase agreements
that cover the term of the project provide for adequate raw materials. Coal, petroleum coke and
natural gas are the largest cost components for the energy portion of this segment. These costs are
mitigated, in part, through long-term cost-pass-through contracts.

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials, including
alcohols, ethyleneamines, cyclohexamine, acrylonitriles and glycols. The Company purchases these
materials from numerous suppliers. Though the Company attempts to pass through increases in the
cost of these materials to its customers whenever possible, it is subject to competitive pressures.

The principal raw materials used in Chemicals are chemical intermediates such as olefins and
aromatic hydrocarbons produced by outside suppliers from basic petrochemical feed-stocks like crude
oil or natural gas. This segment also depends on adequate energy sources and natural gas as a
feedstock for certain products. The Company does not depend on any one supplier for its chemical
intermediates supply.

Despite the Company’s contractual pass-through of the costs of energy, raw materials and delivery
fuel, a shortage or interruption in their supply or an increase in any of their prices that cannot
be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons can negatively impact the Company’s
operations, financial results and cash flow.

Regulatory and Political Risks and Foreign Operations — The Company is subject to extensive
government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business. Regulations
address, among other things, environmental compliance, import/export restrictions, healthcare
services, taxes and financial reporting, and can significantly increase the cost of doing business,
which in turn can negatively impact the Company’s operations, financial results and cash flow.

The Company is subject to government regulation and intervention both in the United States and in
all foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business. Compliance with applicable laws and
regulations results in higher capital expenditures and operating costs and changes to current
regulations with which the Company complies can necessitate further capital expenditures and
increases in operating costs to enable continued compliance. Additionally, from time to time, the
Company is involved in proceedings under certain of these laws and regulations. Foreign operations
are subject to political instabilities, restrictions on funds transfers, import/export restrictions
and currency fluctuation. Significant areas of regulation and intervention include the following:

Environmental and Health Compliance.

The Company is committed to conducting its activities so
that there is no or only minimal damage to the environment; there is no assurance, however, that
its activities will not at times result in liability under environmental and health regulations.
Costs and expenses resulting from such liability may materially negatively impact the Company’s
operations and financial condition. Overall, environmental and health laws and
regulations will continue to affect the Company’s businesses worldwide. For a more detailed
description of these matters, see “Narrative Description of the Company’s Business Generally —
Environmental Controls” herein.



Import/Export Regulation.

The Company is subject to significant regulatory oversight of its
import and export operations due to the nature of its product offerings. The Company voluntarily
participates in various government programs designed to enhance supply chain security and
promote appropriate screening practices and internal controls regarding its purchases and sales
to customers around the world. Penalties for non-compliance can be significant and violation can
result in adverse publicity for the Company.

Nationalization and Expropriation.

The Company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions
are subject to nationalization and expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships
within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. The
occurrence of any of these risks could have a material, adverse impact on the Company’s
operations and financial condition. For a more detailed description of these matters, see
“Narrative Description of the Company’s Business Generally — Foreign Operations” herein.

Home Healthcare Regulation.

The Company’s Healthcare segment is subject to extensive government
regulation, including laws directed at preventing fraud, abuse, kickbacks and false claims, laws
regulating billing and reimbursement under various governmental healthcare programs and laws
related to the privacy of patient data. Enforcement actions may be brought by the government or
by qui tam relaters (private citizens bringing an action on behalf of the government), which
could result in the imposition of fines or exclusion from participation in government healthcare
programs. Also, the government contracts with regional carriers who administer claims processing
for governmental healthcare programs. These carriers conduct both pre-payment and post-payment
reviews and audits, which could result in demands for refunds or recoupments of amounts paid.
The Company maintains a compliance program designed to minimize the likelihood that it would
engage in conduct that violates these requirements or that could result in material refunds or
recoupments. In addition, state and federal healthcare programs are subject to reform by
legislative and administrative initiatives that could impact the relative cost of doing business
and the amount of reimbursement for products and services provided by the Company. The Company
closely monitors reform initiatives and participates actively in trade association and other
activities designed to influence these reforms.

Taxes.

The Company structures its operations to be tax efficient and to make use of tax credits
and other incentives when it makes business sense to do so. Nevertheless, changes in tax laws,
actual results of operations, final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities, and the timing
and rate at which tax credits can be utilized can change the rate at which the Company is taxed,
thereby affecting its financial results and cash flow.

Financial Accounting Standards.

The Company’s financial results can be impacted by new or
modified financial accounting standards.

Financial Market Risks — The Company’s earnings, cash flow and financial position are exposed to
financial market risks worldwide, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations
and exchange rate controls.

The Company operates in over 40 countries. It finances a portion of its operations through United
States and foreign debt markets with various short-term and long-term public and private
borrowings, and conducts its business in both U.S. dollars and many foreign currencies.
Consequently, it is subject to both interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations. The
Company actively manages the interest rate risk inherent in its debt portfolio in accordance with
parameters set by management addressing the type of debt issued (fixed versus floating rate) and
the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company strives to mitigate its currency exchange
rate risks by minimizing cash flow exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates through the
issuance of debt in currencies in which operating cash flows are generated and the use of
derivative financials instruments. Derivative counterparty risk is mitigated by contracting with
major financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings. All derivative instruments
are entered into for other than trading purposes. For a more detailed analysis of these matters see
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein.

Catastrophic Events — Catastrophic events such as natural disasters, pandemics, war and acts of
terrorism, could disrupt the Company’s business or the business of its suppliers or customers, any
of which disruptions could have a negative impact on the Company’s operations, financial results
and cash flow.

The Company’s operations are at all times subject to the occurrence of catastrophic events outside
the Company’s control, ranging from severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods,
earthquakes and storms, to health epidemics and pandemics, to acts of war and terrorism. Any such
event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the Company’s ability to produce
and distribute its products and possibly expose it to third-party liability claims. Additionally,



such events could impact the Company’s suppliers, in which event energy and raw materials may be
unavailable to the Company, and its customers, who may be unable to purchase or accept the
Company’s products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the Company’s
operations and financial condition.

Company Undertakings — The Company actively manages its business to protect and optimize its
assets and businesses. There is no assurance, however, that the Company’s undertakings will result
in the intended protections and optimizations. In certain circumstances, the Company’s undertakings
could negatively impact its operations and financial results.

Operations.

Inherent in the Company’s operations of its facilities, pipelines and delivery
systems are hazards that require continuous oversight and control. If operational risks
materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment or loss of production,
all of which could negatively impact the Company’s on-going operations, financial results and
cash flow. While the safety and security of the Company’s operations have always been a
priority, the Company has significantly expanded its efforts in this area since the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001. It has been an active participant in the development and
implementation of the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care Security Code and has
implemented this Code at all global facilities. Security vulnerability assessments (“SVA”) were
conducted and necessary security upgrades implemented at facilities in North American, Europe
and Asia. There is one remaining project in Asia which will be completed by December 2007 and
security upgrades in Brazil are scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal year 2008. The
Company has also developed global security standards to address the safety and security of its
global supply chain.

Portfolio Management.

The Company continuously reviews and manages its portfolio of assets in
an attempt to conduct its businesses in a manner to maximize value to its shareholders.
Portfolio management involves many variables, including future acquisitions and divestitures,
restructurings and re-segmentations and cost-cutting and productivity initiatives. The timing,
impact and ability to complete such undertakings, the costs and financial charges associated
with such activities and the ultimate financial impact of such undertakings is uncertain and can
have a negative short or long-term impact on the Company’s operations and financial results.

Insurance.

The Company carries public liability and property insurance in amounts that
management believes are sufficient to meet its anticipated needs in light of historical
experience to cover future litigation and property damage claims. Nevertheless, the occurrence
of an unforeseen event for which the Company does not have adequate insurance could result in a
negative impact on its financial results and cash flow. There is no assurance that the Company
will collect insurance proceeds to which it is entitled if an insurer’s business fails or it
refuses to pay in a timely manner. Further, there is no assurance that the Company will not
incur losses beyond the limits of, or outside the coverage of, its insurance policies.

Security.

Acts of terrorism that threaten the Company or its facilities, pipelines,
transportation or computer systems could severely disrupt its business operations and adversely
affect the results of operations.

IT Risk.

The security of the Company’s IT systems could be compromised, which could adversely
affect its ability to operate. The Company utilizes a global enterprise resource planning (ERP)
system and other technologies for the distribution of information both within the Company and to
customers and suppliers. The ERP system and other technologies are potentially vulnerable to
interruption from viruses, hackers or system breakdown. To mitigate these risks, the Company has
implemented a variety of security measures, including virus protection, a state of the art data
center, redundancy procedures and recovery processes. A significant system interruption,
however, could seriously affect the Company’s business operation and financial condition.

Litigation.

The Company is involved from time to time in various legal proceedings, including
competition, environmental, health, safety, product liability and insurance matters. There is a
risk that a lawsuit may be settled or adjudicated for an amount that is not insured. Any such
uninsured amount could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial condition and cash
flow.

Recruiting and Retaining.

Continued business success depends on the recruitment, development
and retention of qualified employees. The inability to attract, develop or retain quality
employees could negatively impact the Company’s business objectives which might adversely affect
the Company’s business operation and financial condition.

recovered at sites in Kansas and Texas and distributed from several transfill sites in the U.S. and
Asia. Sales support offices are located at its Trexlertown headquarters as well as in leased
properties in three states, at several sites in Europe and at 15 sites in Asia.

TONNAGE GASES

Tonnage Gases operates 50 plants in the United States that produce over 300 standard tons-per-day
of product. Over 30 of these facilities produce or recover hydrogen, many of which support the
three major pipeline systems located along the Gulf Coast of Texas, on the Mississippi River
corridor and in Los Angeles, California. The segment also operates approximately 20 tonnage plants
in Europe and 16 tonnage plants within Asia, the majority of which are on leased properties. Sales
support offices are located at the Company’s headquarters in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, as well as
in leased offices in Texas, Louisiana, California and Calgary, Alberta.

ELECTRONICS AND PERFORMANCE MATERIALS

The electronics business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment produces,
packages and stores nitrogen, specialty gases and electronic chemicals at 50 sites in the United
States (the majority of which are leased), nine facilities (including sales offices) in Europe and
over 40 facilities in Asia (approximately half of which are located on customer sites).

The performance materials portion of this segment operates facilities in Los Angeles, California;
Calvert City, Kentucky; Paulsboro, New Jersey; Wichita, Kansas;
Milton, Wisconsin; Reserve, Louisiana;
Clayton, U.K.; Singapore; Isehara, Japan; and Yisin and Changzhou, China. Substantially all of the

This segment has eight field sales offices in the United States as well as sales offices in Europe,
Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and China, the majority of which are leased.

EQUIPMENT AND ENERGY

Equipment and Energy operates five plants and two sales offices in the U.S. The Company
manufactures a significant portion of the world’s supply of LNG equipment at its Wilkes-Barre,
Pennsylvania site. When capacity is available, the site manufactures air separation columns and
cold boxes for company-owned facilities and for sale to third parties. The Acrefair site in the
United Kingdom and a new operation in Caojing, China also produce air separation columns. Cryogenic
transportation containers for liquid helium are manufactured and reconstructed at facilities in
eastern Pennsylvania and Liberal, Kansas. Additional facilities utilized by the segment include
three plants and offices in Europe. Electric power is produced at various facilities including
Stockton, California; Calvert City, Kentucky; and Rotterdam in the Netherlands.



Flue gas
desulfurization operations are conducted at the Pure Air facility in Chesterton, Indiana. The
Company or its affiliates own approximately 50 percent of the real estate in this segment and lease
the remaining 50 percent.

HEALTHCARE

Healthcare has 177 facilities that are located in the United States, six countries in Europe
(including the U.K., Spain and Portugal), Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Korea. The majority of
Healthcare facilities are leased. Many of the U.S. facilities were consolidated or upgraded to
newer facilities in 2007.

In Chemicals, polyurethane intermediates operations are located in Pasadena, Texas and its polymer
emulsions operations are conducted at properties in Calvert City, Kentucky; South Brunswick, New
Jersey; Piedmont, South Carolina; Elkton, Maryland; Cologne, Germany; and Ulsan, Korea. The
Chemicals segment has sales offices and laboratories in the United States, Europe, Mexico, Korea
and China, the majority of which are leased.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

In the normal course of business the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal
proceedings, including competition, environmental, health, safety, product liability and insurance
matters. Certain proceedings involve governmental authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law); the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state environmental laws relating to the designation of
certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there are approximately 33 sites on which
a final settlement has not been reached where the Company, along with others, has been designated a
Potentially Responsible Party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise engaged in
investigation or remediation. The Company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in
connection with these matters would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position. Additional information on the Company’s environmental exposure is included under
“Narrative Description of the Company’s Business Generally — Environmental Controls.”

Represents Long-Term Incentive Plan outstanding stock options and deferred stock units that
have been granted. Deferred stock units entitle the recipient to one share of Company common stock
upon vesting, which is conditioned on continued employment during a deferral period and may also be
conditioned on earn out against certain performance targets.

(2)

Represents authorized shares that were available for future grants as of September 30, 2007.
These shares may be used for options, deferred stock units, restricted stock, and other stock-based
awards to officers, directors, and key employees. Full value awards such as restricted stock are
limited to 20% of cumulative awards.

(3)

Represents outstanding options under Global Employee Stock Awards (295,917), the Stock
Incentive Plan (989,703), the Stock Option Plan for Directors (42,000), and the U.K.
Savings-Related Share Option Schemes (117,195). This number also includes deferred stock units
granted under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors prior to 23 January 2003 (52,399) and
deferred stock units under the Deferred Compensation Plan (93,859). Deferred stock units issued
under the Deferred Compensation Plan are purchased for the fair market value of the underlying
shares of stock with eligible deferred compensation.

The following equity compensation plans or programs were not approved by shareholders. All of these
plans have either been discontinued or do not require shareholder approval because participants
forego current compensation equal to the full market value of any share units credited under the
plans.

Global Employee Stock Option Awards and Stock Incentive Program — No further awards will be made
under these programs. All stock options under these programs were granted at fair market value on
the date of grant, first became exercisable three years after grant, and terminate ten years after
the date of grant or upon the holder’s earlier termination of employment for reasons other than
retirement, disability, death, or involuntary termination due to Company action necessitated by
business conditions.



Stock Option Plan for Directors — No further awards will be made under this plan. All stock
options under this plan were granted at fair market value on the date of grant. The options became
exercisable six months after grant and remain exercisable for nine and one-half years unless the
director resigns from our Board after serving for less than six years (other than because of
disability or death). This plan is no longer offered. Stock options may now be granted to directors
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan; however, since September 2005, the compensation program for
nonemployee directors has not provided stock options.

The Air Products PLC U.K. Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and the Air Products Group Limited
U.K. Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (together, the “U.K. Plan”) are employee benefit plans for
employees of Air Products PLC (and certain of its U.K. subsidiaries) and Air Products Group Limited
(and certain of its U.K. subsidiaries), respectively (together, the “U.K. Companies”). No further
options will be offered under the U.K. Plan. Employees participate in the U.K. Plan by having
elected to do so during a brief invitation period. An employee who elected to participate chose a
five- or seven-year option period and has amounts of salary automatically withheld and contributed
to a savings account at a bank not affiliated with the Company. At the end of the five-year savings
period, a tax-free bonus is added to the employee’s account. An employee who elected a seven-year
option and retains his savings account for seven years receives a further bonus at the end of the
seventh year. At the end of the option period, the participant may use his savings to purchase
shares of Company stock at the fixed option price or receive in cash the amount of his savings and
bonus(es). His election must be made within six months of the close of the option period. The
option price is an amount determined by the directors of the U.K. Companies on the date the option
is granted, which may not be less than 90 percent of Market Value (as defined in the U.K. Plan) on
the date of grant.

Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors — This plan is no longer offered. Our compensation
program for nonemployee directors provides that one-half of each director’s quarterly retainer is
paid in deferred stock units. Directors have the opportunity to purchase more deferred stock units
with up to all of the rest of their retainers and meeting fees. New directors and directors
continuing in office after our annual meetings are awarded an annual grant of deferred stock units.
Each deferred stock unit entitles the director to one share of Company stock when paid out.
Deferred stock units also accrue dividend equivalents which are equal to the dividends that would
have been paid on a share of stock during the period the units are outstanding. Accumulated
dividend equivalents are converted to deferred stock units on a quarterly basis. Deferred stock
units are now provided to directors under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

The Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded employee retirement benefit plan available
to certain of the Company’s U.S.-based management and other highly compensated employees (and those
of its subsidiaries) who receive awards under the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan, which is the
annual cash bonus plan for executives and key salaried employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Because participants forego current compensation to “purchase” deferred stock units
for full value under the Plan, it is not required to be approved by shareholders under the NYSE
listing standards. Under the Plan, participants may defer a portion of base salary which cannot be
contributed to the Company’s Retirement Savings Plan, a 401(k) and profit-sharing plan offered to
all salaried employees (“RSP”), because of tax limitations (“elective deferrals”) and earn matching
contributions from the Company that they would have received if their Elective Deferrals had been
contributed to the RSP (“matching credits”). In addition, participants in the Plan may defer all or
a portion of their bonus awards under the Annual Incentive Plan (“bonus deferrals”) under the
Deferred Compensation Plan. Finally, certain participants under the Plan who participate in the
profit-sharing component of the RSP rather than the Company’s salaried pension plans receive
contribution credits under the Plan which are a percentage of their salary ranging from 4-6% based
on their years of service (“contribution credits”). The dollar amount of elective deferrals,
matching credits, bonus deferrals, and contribution credits is initially credited to an unfunded
account, which earns interest credits. Participants are periodically permitted while employed by
the Company to irrevocably convert all or a portion of their interest bearing account to deferred
stock units in a Company stock account. Upon conversion, the Company stock account is credited with
deferred stock units based on the fair market value of a share of Company stock on the date of
crediting. Dividend equivalents corresponding to the number of units are credited quarterly to the
interest-bearing account. Deferred stock units generally are paid after termination of employment
in shares of Company stock.

The Deferred Compensation Plan was formerly known as the Supplementary Savings Plan. The name was
changed in 2006 when the deferred bonus program, previously administered under the Annual Incentive
Plan, was merged into this Plan.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON SCHEDULE II

The Shareholders and Board of Directors of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.:

Under date of 27 November 2007, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of Air Products and
Chemicals, Inc. and subsidiaries as of 30 September 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
income statements and consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended 30 September 2007, as contained in the Annual Report to
Shareholders. Also, under the date of 27 November 2007, we reported on the effectiveness of Air
Products and Chemicals, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of 30 September 2007.
In connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also
audited the related consolidated financial statement schedule referred to in Item 15 (a)(2) in this
Form 10-K. This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial statement schedule based on our audits.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans,” as of 30 September 2007, Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,” effective 30
September 2006, and SFAS No. 123 (R), “Share-Based Payment,” and related interpretations on 1
October 2005.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.
