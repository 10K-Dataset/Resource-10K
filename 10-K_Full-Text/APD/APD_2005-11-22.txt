PART I

ITEM 1. Business.

Through internal development and by acquisitions, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. has
established an internationally recognized industrial gas and related industrial process equipment
business and developed strong positions as a producer of certain chemicals.

The gases business segment recovers and distributes industrial gases such as oxygen, nitrogen,
helium, argon, and hydrogen, and a variety of medical and specialty gases, and also includes the
Company’s healthcare business. The chemicals business segment produces and markets performance
materials and chemical intermediates. The equipment business segment supplies cryogenic and other
process equipment and related engineering services.

Financial information concerning the Company’s business segments appears in Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein, which information is incorporated
herein by reference, as are all other specific references herein to information appearing in such
2005 Financial Review Section of the Annual Report.

As used in this Report, the term “Air Products” or “Company” includes subsidiaries and
predecessors of the registrant or its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.

GASES

The principal industrial gases sold by the Company are oxygen, nitrogen, argon (primarily
recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air), hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide
(purchased, purified, or recovered through the processing of natural gas or the by-product streams
from process plants), synthesis gas (combined streams of hydrogen and carbon monoxide), and helium
(purchased or refined from crude helium). Medical and specialty gases (which include fluorine
products; rare gases such as xenon, krypton, and neon; and more common gases of high purity) are
manufactured or precisely blended by the Company or purchased for resale. The gases segment
includes the Company’s electronics business, global healthcare, power generation, and flue gas
treatment businesses.

The Company’s gas business involves three principal modes of supply:

“On-site/Pipeline” Supply

—For large volume or “tonnage” users of industrial gases, a plant is
built adjacent to, on, or near the customer’s facility—hence the term “on-site.” Alternatively, the
gases are delivered through a pipeline from nearby locations. Supply is generally made under
long-term contracts, typically five to twenty years in duration. In numerous areas—the Houston
(Texas) Ship Channel including the Port Arthur, Texas, area; “Silicon Valley,” California; Los
Angeles, California; Phoenix, Arizona; Decatur, Alabama; Central Louisiana; Rotterdam, the
Netherlands; Korea; Singapore; Taiwan; Malaysia; and Brazil—Air Products’ hydrogen, oxygen, carbon
monoxide, or nitrogen gas pipelines serve multiple customers from one or more centrally located
plants. Industrial gas companies in which the Company has less than controlling interests have
pipelines in Thailand, Singapore, and South Africa.

Liquid Bulk Supply

—Smaller volumes of industrial gas products are delivered to thousands of
customers in liquid or gaseous form by tanker trucks or tube trailers. These liquid bulk customers
use equipment designed and installed by Air Products to store the product near the point of use,
normally in liquid state, and vaporize the product into gaseous state for their use as needed. Some
customers are also supplied by small on-site generators using noncryogenic technology based on
adsorption and membrane technology which, in certain circumstances, the Company sells to its
customers. Liquid bulk customers’ contract terms normally are from three to five years.

Packaged Gases Supply

—Industrial and various specialty and medical gases also can be delivered
in cylinders, dewars, and lecture bottle sizes. The Company operates packaged gas businesses in
Europe, Asia, and Brazil, but in the United States only sells packaged gases for electronics gases,
helium used in magnetic resonance imaging, and oxygen used by patients in their homes.

Oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen sold to liquid bulk customers are usually recovered or
generated at large “stand-alone” facilities located near industrial areas or high-tech centers or
at small noncryogenic generators, or are taken from on-site plants used primarily to supply tonnage
users. On-site plants are frequently designed to have more capacity than is required by their
principal customer to recover additional product that is liquefied for sale to a liquid bulk
market. Air Products also designs and builds systems for recovering oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon
monoxide, and low dew point gases using adsorption technology.



Sales of atmospheric gases—oxygen, nitrogen, and argon—constituted approximately 23 percent of
Air Products’ consolidated sales in fiscal year 2005, 24 percent in fiscal year 2004, and 25
percent in fiscal year 2003.

The largest markets are chemical processing, electronics, refining (which uses inert nitrogen
for oil well stimulation and field pressurization and hydrogen and oxygen for refining), food
processing (which uses liquid nitrogen for food freezing), and medical gases. Air Products is a
leading liquefier of hydrogen, which it supplies to many customers, including the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration for its space shuttle program. The Company has its largest
industrial gas market positions in the United States and Europe.

The
Company was impacted by Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, and Rita.
The Company’s New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane
Katrina in August 2005. This facility is expected to return to substantial operations by the end of the calendar year.
For a discussion of the financial impact from these Hurricanes see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein.

The global healthcare business of Air Products is directed at two main markets: institutional
and homecare. The institutional market uses medical gases in hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes,
as well as helium for use in magnetic resonance imaging. The homecare business involves the
delivery of respiratory therapy services, infusion services, and home medical equipment to patients
in their homes in Europe, South America, and principally in the eastern United States.

The electronics business of Air Products is a materials and services solutions provider to the
electronics industry supplying consumable products that surround its customers’ process tools.
These products include industrial gases, electronic specialty gases (such as silane, arsine,
silicon tetrafluoride, nitrogen trifluoride, carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoromethane, and tungsten
hexafluoride), electronic specialty chemicals, high purity wet process chemicals, and
photolithography products. In certain circumstances the Company sells equipment related to the use,
handling, and storage of such electronic gases and chemicals.

Sales of industrial gases and sales of specialty products are made principally through
regional offices in the United States, Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia.

Electricity and hydrocarbons, including natural gas as a feedstock for producing certain
gases, are important to Air Products’ gas business. See “Raw Materials and Energy.” The Company’s
large truck fleet, which delivers products to liquid bulk customers, requires a readily available
supply of gasoline or diesel fuel. Also, environmental and health laws and regulations will
continue to affect the Company’s gas businesses. See “Environmental Controls.”

Air Products operates and has 50 percent interests in a 49-megawatt fluidized-bed coal-fired
power generation facility in Stockton, California and in a 24-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle
power generation facility near Rotterdam, the Netherlands. A 112-megawatt gas-fueled power
generation facility, in which the Company has a 48.8 percent interest, operates in Thailand and
supplies electricity to a state-owned electricity generating authority and steam and electricity to
an Air Products industrial gases affiliate. The Company also constructed, operates, and has a 50
percent interest in a flue gas treatment facility in Indiana.

CHEMICALS

The Company’s chemicals businesses consist of performance materials and chemical
intermediates, where the Company is able to differentiate itself by the performance of its products
in the customer’s application, the technical service that the Company provides, and the scale of
production and the production technology employed by the Company.

Chemical sales are supported from various locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and
Africa, and through sales representatives or distributors in most industrialized countries. Dry
products are delivered in railcars, trucks, drums, bags, and cartons. Liquid products are delivered
by barge, rail tank cars, tank trailers, drums and pails, and, at one location, by pipeline.

The chemicals business depends on adequate energy sources, including natural gas as a
feedstock for the production of certain products (see “Raw Materials and Energy”), and will
continue to be affected by various environmental and health laws and regulations (see
“Environmental Controls”).

Performance Materials

The principal businesses of performance materials are performance polymers, performance
solutions, and performance products. Total sales from the performance materials business
constituted approximately 14 percent of Air Products’ consolidated sales in fiscal year 2005, 15
percent in fiscal year 2004, and 15 percent in fiscal year 2003. Air



Products’ performance
materials are differentiated from the competition’s based on their functionality when used in the
customer’s products and applications, and by the technical service the Company provides.

Performance Polymers

— Air Products owns 65 percent of a worldwide joint venture with
Wacker-Chemie GmbH that produces polymer emulsions and pressure-sensitive adhesives. The Company
also owns 20 percent of a worldwide joint venture with Wacker-Chemie GmbH that produces
redispersible powders made from polymer emulsions.

Air Products’ polymers are water-based and water-soluble emulsion products derived primarily
from vinyl acetate monomer. The Company’s major emulsions products are AIRFLEX

®

vinyl
acetate-ethylene copolymer emulsions and vinyl acetate homopolymer emulsions. The Company also
produces emulsions that incorporate vinyl chloride and various acrylates in the polymer. These
products are used in adhesives, nonwoven fabric binders, paper coatings, paints, inks, and carpet
backing binder formulations.

Performance Solutions

—These products are primarily acetylenic alcohols and amines that are
used as performance additives in coatings, lubricants, electro-deposition processes, agricultural
formulations, and corrosion inhibitors.

Performance Products

—These products include polyurethane catalysts and surfactants that are
used as performance control additives and processing aids in the production of both flexible and
rigid polyurethane foam around the world. The principal end markets for polyurethane foams include
furniture cushioning, insulation, carpet underlay, bedding, and automobile seating.

Performance products also include epoxy additives such as polyamides, aromatic amines,
cycloaliphatic amines, reactive diluents, and specialty epoxy resins that are used as performance
additives in epoxy formulations by epoxy manufacturers worldwide. The end markets for epoxies are
coatings, flooring, adhesives, reinforced composites, and electrical laminates.

Chemical Intermediates

The chemical intermediates businesses use the Company’s proprietary technology and scale of
production to differentiate themselves from the competition. The principal intermediates sold by
the Company include amines and polyurethane intermediates. The Company also produces nitric acid as
a raw material for its products. Total third-party sales from the chemical intermediates businesses
constituted 9 percent of Air Products’ consolidated sales in 2005 and 10 percent of consolidated
sales in 2004 and 2003.

Amines

—The Company produces a broad range of amines using ammonia, methanol, and other alcohol
feedstocks purchased from various suppliers. Substantial quantities of these products are sold
under long-term contracts to a small number of customers. These products are used by the Company’s
customers as raw materials in the manufacture of herbicides, pesticides, water treatment chemicals,
animal nutrients, polyurethane coatings, rubber chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. In 2004 the Company
shut down its methanol and ammonia production facilities and began purchasing all of its methanol
and ammonia requirements. The Company sold its European methylamines and derivatives business in December
2004. In 2005, the Company solicited offers to purchase its ammonium nitrate
prills business.

Polyurethane Intermediates

—The Company produces dinitrotoluene (“DNT”) and toluene diamine
(“TDA”) for use as intermediates by the Company’s customers in the manufacture of a major precursor
of flexible polyurethane foam. The principal end markets for flexible polyurethane foams include
furniture cushioning, carpet underlay, bedding, and seating in automobiles. Most of the Company’s
production of DNT and TDA is sold under long-term contracts to a small number of customers. In
2005, one of these customers closed its facility and another terminated its contract. Additional
operating income of $16 million was recognized during the fourth quarter in connection with the
contract termination for the present value of the contractual termination payments required under
the supply contract. This contract termination and the customer shutdown are expected to
significantly reduce the profitability of this product line in 2006.

EQUIPMENT

The Company designs and manufactures equipment for cryogenic air separation, gas processing,
natural gas liquefaction, and hydrogen purification. Air Products also designs and builds systems
for recovering hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and low dew point gases using
membrane technology. This segment further designs and builds cryogenic transportation containers
for liquid helium and hydrogen. Customers include companies involved in chemical and petrochemical
manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, power generation, and steel and primary metals
processing. Additionally, a broad range of plant design, engineering, procurement, and construction
management



services is provided for the above areas. Equipment is manufactured for use by the gases
segment and for sale in industrial markets that include the Company’s international industrial gas
joint ventures.

The backlog of orders (including letters of intent) believed to be firm from other companies
and equity affiliates for equipment was approximately $652 million on 30 September 2005,
approximately 22 percent of which relates to cryogenic air separation, and 61 percent of which
relates to liquefied natural gas, as compared with a total backlog of approximately $297 million on
30 September 2004. It is expected that approximately $408 million of the backlog on 30 September
2005 will be completed during fiscal year 2006.

GENERAL

Foreign Operations

Air Products, through subsidiaries and affiliates, conducts business in numerous countries
outside the United States. The structure of the Air Products gas business in Europe is comparable
to the Company’s United States operation, except that in Europe, the Company is also engaged in a
broader packaged gas business. Air Products’ international business is subject to risks customarily
encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
controls, import and export controls, and other economic, political, and regulatory policies of
local governments.

The Company’s industrial gas segment, through investments ranging from wholly-owned
subsidiaries to minority ownership interests, does business in approximately 39 countries outside
the United States. Majority and wholly owned industrial gas subsidiaries operate in Argentina,
Brazil, and Canada, and throughout Europe and Asia in 15 and 12 countries, respectively. There are
50 percent industrial gas joint ventures in Canada, South Africa, and Trinidad and Tobago, six
countries in Europe, and six countries in Asia, and less than controlling interests in Canada,
Mexico, two countries in Africa, four countries in Europe, four countries in Central America, and
six countries in Asia. The Company has a 50 percent joint venture in the U.K. that is developing
products relating to silicon wafer polishing, chemical mechanical planarization processes, and hard
disk polishing. The Company also has a 50 percent interest in a power generation facility in the
Netherlands and a 48.8 percent interest in one in Thailand.

The principal geographic markets for the Company’s chemical products are in 11 countries, with
operations in North America, Europe, Asia, Brazil, and Mexico. Majority and wholly owned
subsidiaries operate in Brazil, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Japan, Korea,
China, Singapore, Taiwan, and Mexico. The polymer emulsions and pressure-sensitive adhesives joint
venture with Wacker-Chemie GmbH has headquarters in the United States and production facilities in
the United States, Germany, and Korea, along with a technical service center in Shanghai, China.
Headquarters for the 20 percent investment in the redispersible powder venture with Wacker-Chemie
GmbH are in Germany with manufacturing facilities in Germany, the United States, and China. The
Company also has controlling interests in Korea and Taiwan and less than controlling interests in
Japan in companies that sell chemicals to the electronics industry.

Financial information about Air Products’ foreign operations and investments is included in
Notes 8, 17, 18, and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein.
Information about foreign currency translation is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8 herein, under “Foreign Currency,” and information on Company
exposure to currency fluctuations is included in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included under Item 8 herein. Export sales from operations in the United States to unconsolidated
customers amounted to $719 million, $611 million, and $497 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively. Total export sales in fiscal year 2005 included $419 million in export sales to
affiliated customers. The sales to affiliated customers were primarily equipment sales and
electronic specialty materials sales.

Technology Development

Air Products pursues a market-oriented approach to technology development that includes
research and development, engineering, and commercial development. The Company conducts research
and development principally in its laboratories located in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, as well as in
Carlsbad, California and Phoenix, Arizona in the U.S.; Basingstoke, London, and Carrington in the
U.K.; Burghausen and Hamburg, Germany; Utrecht, the Netherlands; Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China;
Giheung, Korea; Hsinchu, Taiwan; and Barcelona and Madrid, Spain. The Company also funds and works
closely on research and development programs with a number of major universities and conducts
research work funded by others, principally the United States Government.



Research and development expenditures during fiscal year 2005 were $133 million, $127 million
in fiscal year 2004, and $121 million in fiscal year 2003. Amounts expended by the Company on
customer-sponsored research activities during fiscal year 2005 were $17 million, $14 million in
fiscal year 2004, and $15 million in fiscal year 2003.

In the gases and equipment segments, technology development is directed primarily to
developing new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial
gases, electronic specialty gases, electronic specialty chemicals, and hydrocarbons; developing new
products; and developing new and improved applications for such products. It is through such
applications and improvements that the Company has become a major supplier to the electronics and
chemical process industries, including gases from air separation, specialty gases, and hydrogen.
Additionally, technology development for the equipment business is directed primarily to reducing
the capital and operating costs of its facilities and to commercializing new technologies in gas
production, liquefaction, and separation. There are also development activities for the medical
business supplying gases, equipment, and services to the homecare market.

In the chemicals segment, technology development is primarily concerned with new products and
applications to strengthen and extend the Company’s present positions in polymer and performance
materials. In addition, a major continuing effort supports the development of new and improved
process and manufacturing technology for chemical intermediates and polymers.

A corporate research group supports the research efforts of the Company’s various businesses.
This group includes the Company’s Corporate Science and Technology Center, which conducts research
in areas important to the long-term growth of the Company with focus on performance materials.

As of 1 November 2005, Air Products owned 1,056 United States patents and 2,376 foreign
patents. The Company is also licensed under certain patents owned by others. While the patents and
licenses are considered important, Air Products does not consider its business as a whole to be
materially dependent upon any particular patent or patent license, or group of patents or licenses.

Raw Materials and Energy

The Company manufactures hydrogen, carbon monoxide, synthesis gas, and carbon dioxide
principally from natural gas. Such products accounted for approximately 17 percent of the Company’s
consolidated sales in fiscal year 2005. The Company’s principal raw material purchases are chemical
intermediates produced by others from basic petrochemical feedstocks such as olefins and aromatic
hydrocarbons. These feedstocks are generally derived from various crude oil fractions or from
liquids extracted from natural gas. The Company purchases its chemical intermediates from many
sources and generally is not dependent on one supplier. However, with respect to vinyl acetate
monomer that supports the performance polymer business, the Company is heavily dependent on a
single supplier under a long-term contract that produces vinyl acetate monomer from several
facilities. The Company characterizes the availability of these chemical intermediates as generally
being readily available. The Company uses such raw materials in the production of emulsions,
amines, polyurethane intermediates, specialty additives, polyurethane additives, and epoxy
additives. Such products accounted for approximately 22 percent of the Company’s consolidated sales
in fiscal year 2005. Natural gas is an energy source at a number of the Company’s facilities. The
Company also purchases ammonia under long-term contracts as a feedstock for several of its
chemicals facilities. In 2005, the Company began purchasing methanol under a long-term supply
arrangement. Methanol, produced from natural gas, is a feedstock in methylamine production.

A long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of dinitrotoluene (DNT), emerged
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2003. To facilitate the supplier’s ability to emerge from
bankruptcy and to continue supplying product to the Company, the Company agreed to participate in
the supplier’s financing and has continued to provide additional financing. Total loans to the supplier at 30 September 2005 were $86 million. If
the supplier does not continue to operate, the sales and profitability of the chemicals segment
could be materially impacted on an annual basis because of the Company’s inability to supply all of
its customers’ base requirements. The Company does not expect a material loss related to this
supplier.

The Company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electrical power.
Electricity is the largest cost input for the production of atmospheric gases. Any shortage of
electrical power or interruption of its supply or increase in its price that cannot be passed
through to customers for competitive reasons will adversely affect the liquid bulk gas business of
the Company.



In addition, the Company purchases finished and semi-finished materials and chemical
intermediates from many suppliers. During fiscal year 2005, no significant difficulties were
encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials.

Environmental Controls

The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the United States and
foreign countries where it has operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in
higher capital expenditures and costs. Additionally, from time to time, the Company is involved in
proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (the
federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. Additional
information with respect to these proceedings is included under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, below.
The Company’s accounting policies on environmental expenditures are discussed in Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein.

The amounts charged to earnings on an after-tax basis related to environmental matters totaled
$26 million in 2005, $32 million in 2004, and $30 million in 2003. These amounts represent an
estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, as well as remedial activities, and
costs incurred to meet internal Company standards. Such costs are estimated to be $26 million in
2006 and $27 million in 2007.

Although precise amounts are difficult to define, the Company estimates that in fiscal year
2005 it spent approximately $8 million on capital projects to control pollution versus $12 million
in 2004. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately
$7 million in 2006 and $7 million in 2007.

To the extent long-term contracts have been entered into for supply of product, such as for
the industrial gas on-site business and for certain chemical products, the cost of any
environmental compliance generally is contractually passed through to the customer.

It is the Company’s policy to accrue environmental investigatory and noncapital remediation
costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from
$8 million to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $17 million. The accrual on the balance sheet
for 30 September 2005 was $13 million and for 30 September 2004 was $14 million. Actual costs to
be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in
evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental
costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental
matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse effect
on its financial condition or results of operations in any one year.

Competition

The Company’s businesses face strong competition from others, some of which are larger and
have greater resources than Air Products.

Air Products’ industrial gas business competes in the United States with three major sellers
and with several regional sellers. Competition in industrial gas markets is based primarily on
price, reliability of supply, and furnishing or developing applications for use of such gases by
customers, and in some cases the provisions of other services or products such as power and steam
generation. Similar competitive situations exist in European and Asian industrial gas markets in
which the Company competes against one or more larger entrenched competitors in most countries.

The division of the Company’s gas business that serves the electronics industry offers
electronic specialty gases, chemicals, services, and equipment. These products face competition
from competitors who vary from product to product, ranging from niche suppliers having only a
single product, to larger and more vertically integrated chemical companies with greater financial
resources than the Company. Competition in these products is principally on the basis of price,
quality, product performance, and reliability of product supply.

Competition in the institutional market of the global healthcare business is principally from
other large, established industrial gas companies using business models (long-term product supply
agreements) that are similar to those the companies utilize for other industrial gas supply
relationships. Competition in this market is principally based on regulatory compliance (FDA),
price, quality, service, and reliability of supply. Homecare is served by national and local
providers, and in the U.S. there are over 2,000 regional and local providers. The homecare market
is highly competitive. In the United



States reimbursement levels are established by fee schedules
regulated by Medicare and Medicaid, or by the levels negotiated with insurance companies.
Accordingly, in the United States, homecare companies compete primarily on the basis of service.
Maintaining competitiveness requires efficient logistics, reimbursement, and accounts receivable
systems.

The number of the Company’s principal competitors in the chemicals business varies from
product to product, and it is not practical to identify such competitors because of the broad range
of the Company’s chemical products and the markets served, although the Company believes it has a
leading or strong market position in most of its chemical products. For amines the competition is
principally from other large chemical companies that also have the ability to provide competitive
pricing, reliability of supply, technical service assistance, and quality products and services.
The possibility of back integration by large customers is the major competitive factor for the sale
of polyurethane additives. In its other chemical products, the Company competes with a large number
of chemical companies, some of which are larger, possess greater financial resources, and are more
vertically integrated than the Company. Competition in these products is principally on the basis
of price, quality, product performance, reliability of product supply, and technical service
assistance.

The Company’s equipment business competes in all aspects with a great number of firms, some of
which have greater financial resources than Air Products. Competition is based primarily on
technological performance, service, technical know-how, price, and performance guarantees.

Insurance

The Company’s policy is to obtain public liability and property insurance coverage that is
currently available at what management determines to be a fair and reasonable price. The Company
maintains public liability and property insurance coverage at amounts that management believes are
sufficient to meet the Company’s anticipated needs in light of historical experience to cover
future litigation and claims. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will not incur
losses beyond the limits of, or outside the coverage of, its insurance.

Employees

On 30 September 2005, the Company (including majority-owned subsidiaries) had approximately
20,200 employees of whom 19,500 were full-time employees, and of whom approximately 9,200 were
located outside the United States. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with unions at
various locations that expire on various dates over the next three to four years.
The Company considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory and does not believe that the impact of any
expiring or expired collective bargaining agreements will result in a material adverse impact on
the Company.

ITEM 2.

Properties.

The principal executive offices, which are owned by Air Products, are located at its
headquarters in Trexlertown, near Allentown, Pennsylvania. Additional administrative offices are
located in facilities it owns in Hersham, near London, England and Hattingen, Germany.
Administrative offices are also located in facilities leased in the Allentown and Philadelphia
areas in Pennsylvania; Mississauga, Ontario, Canada; Tokyo, Japan; Hong Kong, China; Singapore;
Brussels, Belgium; Paris, France; Barcelona, Spain; and Sao Paulo, Brazil. Management believes the
Company’s manufacturing facilities, described in more detail below, are adequate to support its
businesses. The following information with respect to properties is as of 30 September 2005.

Gases

In the United States and Canada, the gases segment has over 220 plant facilities in 35 states
and two provinces. The majority of these plants recover nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. The Company
continues to focus on the production of refinery hydrogen with 37 facilities that produce and/or
recover hydrogen and three major pipeline systems located along the Gulf Coast of Texas, along the
Mississippi River corridor, and in Los Angeles, California. Additional facilities produce
specialty gases, clean electronic parts, and produce electronic chemicals. Helium is recovered at
plants in Kansas and Texas. The properties on which these plants are located are owned by Air
Products at approximately one-fourth of the locations and leased by Air Products at the remaining
locations. In virtually all cases, however, the plant itself is owned and operated by Air Products.
In addition, the Company operates 16 sales offices located in seven states and two provinces, most
of which are located in leased facilities.

Air Products’ European gases segment has approximately 70 plant facilities, including
facilities that recover hydrogen, manufacture dissolved acetylene, recover carbon monoxide, and
produce electronic chemicals. As in the U.S., the majority of European plants recover nitrogen,
oxygen, and argon. The Company began operations in Switzerland in 2005 with the startup of hydrogen
production in Cressier. In addition, there are five specialty gas centers and over 100 sales
offices and/or cylinder distribution centers in Europe.

There are additional facilities located in Brazil and the Middle East.

In Asia, the gases segment continues to expand its production capacity, particularly in China
where three facilities were added in 2005. Over 130 production facilities supply a diverse
customer base in nine countries, including those in India and Thailand where the Company has just
less than 50 percent equity ownership. Production includes electronic specialty materials and
hydrogen, as well as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon. The property on which these plants are located is
owned by Air Products at approximately one-fifth of the locations and leased by Air Products at the
remaining locations. There are over 50 sales offices and distribution centers located throughout
the region, half of which are owned sites and the remainder leased. There are nine country specific
administration offices, with principal regional management offices located in Taipei, Hong Kong,
Shanghai, and Singapore.

Global healthcare has 182 facilities in the United States, Canada, and Argentina, and six
countries in Europe. In 2005, acquisitions in Florida, Tennessee, and Indiana added a total of 15
locations. The majority of the facilities for global healthcare are leased.

Chemicals

The chemicals segment manufactures amines and nitric acid at its Pace, Florida facility;
alkylamines at its St. Gabriel, Louisiana facility and its Camacari, Bahia, Brazil facility; vinyl
acetate/ethylene copolymer emulsions at its South Brunswick, New Jersey facility; dinitrotoluene at
its Geismar, Louisiana facility; vinyl acetate/ethylene and vinyl chloride/ethylene copolymer
emulsions at its Cologne, Germany facility; nitric acid, dinitrotoluene, and toluene diamine at its
Pasadena, Texas facility; vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymer emulsions, vinyl chloride/ethylene
copolymer emulsions, polyvinyl acetate emulsions and acetylenic chemicals at its Calvert City,
Kentucky facility; vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymer emulsions at its Ulsan, Korea facility;
specialty amines at its Wichita, Kansas facility; and epoxy additives at its facilities in
Manchester, England; Singapore; Japan; and Los Angeles, California. The chemicals segment
manufactures polyurethane additives and polyurethane specialty products
(AIRTHANE

®

/VERSATHANE

®

) at its Paulsboro, New Jersey facility that is leased
in part and owned in part. A joint venture in China was recently formed for the production of TEDA
polyurethane additives. The chemicals segment also manufactures polyvinyl acetate emulsions
and pressure sensitive adhesive emulsions at two smaller locations in Elkton, Maryland and
Piedmont, South Carolina. Substantially all of the chemicals segment’s plants and real estate are
owned.



The chemicals segment has sales offices and laboratories in the United States, Europe, Brazil,
Mexico, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and China, and representative offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and
Hong Kong. The Company leases approximately 75 percent of the offices and owns the remainder.

Equipment

The equipment segment operates seven plants and two sales offices in the United States. The
Company manufactures a significant portion of its cryogenic air separation and natural gas
liquefaction equipment at its Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania site. Cryogenic transportation containers
for liquid helium are manufactured and reconstructed at facilities in Bethlehem and Allentown,
Pennsylvania and Liberal, Kansas. Additional facilities utilized by the equipment segment include
two plants and one office in Europe, offices in Japan and China, and plants in Korea and China. Air
Products owns approximately 50 percent of the facilities and real estate in this segment and leases
the remaining 50 percent.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of business Air Products and its subsidiaries are involved in various
legal proceedings, including competition, environmental, health, safety, product liability, and
insurance matters. Certain proceedings involve governmental authorities under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law); the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state environmental laws relating to the
designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there are approximately 36
sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the Company, along with others, has
been designated a Potentially Responsible Party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is
otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation. The Company does not expect that any sums it may
have to pay in connection with these matters would have a materially adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, nor is there any material additional exposure expected in any one
year in excess of the amounts the Company currently has accrued. Additional information on the
Company’s environmental exposure is included under “Environmental Controls.”

The Company previously disclosed that Honeywell International, Inc. and GEM Microelectronics
Materials, LLC (“Honeywell”) filed suit against the Company alleging breach of contract resulting
from the termination of a strategic alliance agreement dated 1 October 1998. Honeywell was awarded
damages in the amount of $8.1 million, which amount was recorded against previously established
accruals. Honeywell filed an appeal of the court’s decision and the Company filed a cross appeal.
The parties ultimately settled the case and the Company recognized an expense for an additional amount not considered material to the Company.

ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Not applicable.

PART II

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

Products’ common stock are paid quarterly. The Company’s objective is to pay dividends consistent
with the reinvestment of earnings necessary for long-term growth.
