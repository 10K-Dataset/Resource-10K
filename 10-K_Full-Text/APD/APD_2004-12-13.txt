PART I

ITEM 1. Business.

Through internal development and by acquisitions, Air Products and
Chemicals, Inc. has established an internationally recognized industrial gas
and related industrial process equipment business and developed strong
positions as a producer of certain chemicals.

The gases business segment recovers and distributes industrial gases such
as oxygen, nitrogen, helium, argon, and hydrogen, and a variety of medical and
specialty gases, and also includes the Company’s healthcare business. The
chemicals business segment produces and markets performance materials and
chemical intermediates. The equipment business segment supplies cryogenic and
other process equipment and related engineering services.

Financial information concerning the Company’s business segments appears
in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8
herein, which information is incorporated herein by reference, as are all other
specific references herein to information appearing in such 2004 Financial
Review Section of the Annual Report.

As used in this Report, the term “Air Products” or “Company” includes
subsidiaries and predecessors of the registrant or its subsidiaries, unless the
context indicates otherwise.

GASES

The principal industrial gases sold by the Company are oxygen, nitrogen,
argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air), hydrogen,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide (purchased, purified, or recovered through the
processing of natural gas or the by-product streams from process plants),
synthesis gas (combined streams of hydrogen and carbon monoxide), and helium
(purchased or refined from crude helium). Medical and specialty gases (which
include fluorine products; rare gases such as xenon, krypton, and
neon; and
more common gases of high purity) are manufactured or precisely blended by the
Company or purchased for resale. The gases segment also includes the Company’s
electronics business, global healthcare, power generation, and flue gas
treatment businesses.

The Company’s gas business involves three principal modes of supply:

“On-site/pipeline” supply

—For large volume or “tonnage” users of
industrial gases, a plant is built adjacent to, on, or near the customer’s
facility—hence the term “on-site.” Alternatively, the gases are delivered
through a pipeline from nearby locations. Supply is generally made under
long-term contracts, typically five to twenty years in duration. In numerous
areas—the Houston (Texas) Ship Channel including the Port Arthur, Texas, area;
“Silicon Valley,” California; Los Angeles, California; Phoenix, Arizona;
Decatur, Alabama; Central Louisiana; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Korea;
Singapore; Taiwan; Malaysia; and Brazil—Air Products’ hydrogen, oxygen, carbon
monoxide, or nitrogen gas pipelines serve multiple customers from one or more
centrally located plants. Industrial gas companies in which the Company has
less than controlling interests have pipelines in Thailand, Singapore, and
South Africa.

Liquid bulk supply

—Smaller volumes of industrial gas products are
delivered to thousands of customers in liquid or gaseous form by tanker trucks
or tube trailers. These liquid bulk customers use equipment designed and
installed by Air Products to store the product near the point of use, normally
in liquid state, and vaporize the product into gaseous state for their use as
needed. Some customers are also supplied by small on-site generators using
noncryogenic technology based on adsorption and membrane technology which, in
certain circumstances, the Company sells to its customers. Liquid bulk
customers’ contract terms normally are from three to five years.

Packaged gases supply

—Industrial and various specialty and medical gases
also can be delivered in cylinders, dewars, and lecture bottle sizes. The
Company operates packaged gas businesses in Europe, Asia, and Brazil, but in
the United States, only sells packaged gases for electronics gases, helium used
in magnetic resonance imaging, and oxygen used by patients in their home.

Oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen sold to liquid bulk customers are
usually recovered or generated at large “stand-alone” facilities located near
industrial areas or high-tech centers, or at small noncryogenic generators, or
are taken from on-site plants used primarily to supply tonnage users. On-site
plants are frequently designed to have more capacity than is required by their
principal customer to recover additional product that is liquefied for sale to
a liquid bulk market. Air Products also designs and builds systems for
recovering oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and low dew point gases
using adsorption technology.



Sales of atmospheric gases—oxygen, nitrogen, and argon—constituted
approximately 24 percent of Air Products’ consolidated sales in fiscal year
2004, 25 percent in fiscal year 2003, and 26 percent in fiscal year 2002. Sales
of industrial gases—principally oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen—to the chemical
process industry and the electronics industry, the largest consuming
industries, were approximately 19 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of Air
Products’ consolidated sales in fiscal year 2004.

Other important consumers of Air Products’ industrial and specialty gases
are the basic steel industry, the oil industry (which uses inert nitrogen for
oil well stimulation and field pressurization and hydrogen and oxygen for
refining), the food industry (which uses liquid nitrogen for food freezing),
and the institutional healthcare industry. Air Products believes that it is the
largest liquefier of hydrogen, which it supplies to many customers, including
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for its space shuttle
program.

The global healthcare business of Air Products is directed at two main
markets: institutional and homecare. The institutional market uses medical
gases in hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes, as well as helium for use in
magnetic resonance imaging. The homecare business involves the delivery of
respiratory therapy services, infusion services, and home medical equipment to
patients in their homes in Europe, South America, and principally in the
eastern United States.

The electronics business of Air Products is a materials and services
solutions provider to the electronics industry supplying consumable products
that surround its customers’ process tools. These products include industrial
gases, electronic specialty gases (such as silane, arsine, silicon
tetrafluoride, nitrogen trifluoride, carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoromethane,
and tungsten hexafluoride), electronic specialty chemicals, high purity wet
process chemicals, and photolithography products. In certain circumstances the
Company sells equipment related to the use, handling, and storage of such
electronic gases and chemicals.

Sales of industrial gases and sales of specialty products to the
electronics industry and others are made principally through regional offices
in the United States, Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia.

Electricity and hydrocarbons, including natural gas as a feedstock for
producing certain gases, are important to Air Products’ gas business. See “Raw
Materials and Energy.” The Company’s large truck fleet, which delivers products
to liquid bulk customers, requires a readily available supply of gasoline or
diesel fuel. Also, environmental and health laws and regulations will continue
to affect the Company’s gas businesses. See “Environmental Controls.”

Air Products operates and has 50 percent interests in a 49-megawatt
fluidized-bed coal-fired power generation facility in Stockton, California and
in a 24-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle power generation facility near
Rotterdam, the Netherlands. A 112-megawatt gas-fueled power generation
facility, in which the Company has a 48.8 percent interest, operates in
Thailand and supplies electricity to a state-owned electricity generating
authority and steam and electricity to an Air Products industrial gases
affiliate. The Company also constructed, operates, and has a 50 percent
interest in a flue gas treatment facility in Indiana. Additional information
with respect to the Company’s power generation and flue gas treatment
businesses is included in Notes 8 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8 herein.

CHEMICALS

The Company’s chemicals businesses consist of performance materials and
chemical intermediates, where the Company is able to differentiate itself by
the performance of its products in the customer’s application, the technical
service that the Company provides, and the scale of production and the
production technology employed by the Company.

Chemical sales are supported from various locations in North America,
Europe, Asia, and Africa, and through sales representatives or distributors in
most industrialized countries. Dry products are delivered in railcars, trucks,
drums, bags, and cartons. Liquid products are delivered by barge, rail tank
cars, tank trailers, drums and pails, and, at one location, by pipeline.

The chemicals business depends on adequate energy sources, including
natural gas as a feedstock for the production of certain products (see “Raw
Materials and Energy”), and will continue to be affected by various
environmental and health laws and regulations (see “Environmental Controls”).

Performance Materials

The principal businesses of performance materials are Performance
Polymers, Performance Solutions, and Performance Products. Total sales from the
performance materials business constituted approximately 15 percent of Air
Products’ consolidated sales in fiscal year 2004, 15 percent in fiscal year
2003, and 17 percent in fiscal year 2002. Air



Products’ performance materials are differentiated from the competition
based on their functionality when used in the customer’s products and
applications, and by the technical service the Company provides.

Performance Polymers

— Air Products owns 65 percent of a worldwide joint
venture with Wacker-Chemie GmbH that produces polymer emulsions and
pressure-sensitive adhesives. The Company also owns 20 percent of a worldwide
joint venture with Wacker-Chemie GmbH that produces redispersible powders made
from polymer emulsions.

Air Products’ polymers are water-based and water-soluble emulsion products
derived primarily from vinyl acetate monomer. The Company’s major emulsions
products are AIRFLEX

®

vinyl acetate-ethylene copolymer emulsions and vinyl
acetate homopolymer emulsions. The Company also produces emulsions that
incorporate vinyl chloride and various acrylates in the polymer. These products
are used in adhesives, nonwoven fabric binders, paper coatings, paints, inks,
and carpet backing binder formulations.

Performance Solutions

—These products are primarily acetylenic alcohols and
amines that are used as performance additives in coatings, lubricants,
electro-deposition processes, agricultural formulations, and corrosion
inhibitors.

Performance Products

—These products include polyurethane catalysts and
surfactants that are used as performance control additives and processing aids
in the production of both flexible and rigid polyurethane foam around the
world. The principal end markets for polyurethane foams include furniture
cushioning, insulation, carpet underlay, bedding, and automobile seating.

Performance Products also includes epoxy additives such as polyamides,
aromatic amines, cycloaliphatic amines, reactive diluents, and specialty epoxy
resins that are used as performance additives in epoxy formulations by epoxy
manufacturers worldwide. The end markets for epoxies are coatings, flooring,
adhesives, reinforced composites, and electrical laminates.

Chemical Intermediates

The chemical intermediates businesses use the Company’s proprietary
technology and scale of production to differentiate themselves from the
competition. The principal intermediates sold by the Company include amines and
polyurethane intermediates. The Company also produces nitric acid as a raw
material for its products. Total third-party sales from the chemical
intermediates businesses constituted 10 percent of Air Products’ consolidated
sales in each of fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002.

Amines

—The Company produces a broad range of amines using ammonia,
methanol, and other alcohol feedstocks purchased from various suppliers.
Substantial quantities of these products are sold under long-term contracts to
a small number of customers. These products are used by the Company’s customers
as raw materials in the manufacture of herbicides, pesticides, water treatment
chemicals, animal nutrients, polyurethane coatings, rubber chemicals, and
pharmaceuticals. Additional ammonia is purchased and converted to ammonium
nitrate prills and solutions that are primarily sold to customers as
fertilizers or for other chemical applications. In 2004 the Company shut down
its methanol and ammonia production facilities and began purchasing all of its
methanol and ammonia requirements. The Company has announced its plan to sell
the European methylamines and derivatives business.

Polyurethane Intermediates

—The Company produces dinitrotoluene (“DNT”) and
toluene diamine (“TDA”) for use as intermediates by the Company’s customers in
the manufacture of a major precursor of flexible polyurethane foam. The
principal end markets for flexible polyurethane foams include furniture
cushioning, carpet underlay, bedding, and seating in automobiles. Most of the
Company’s production of DNT and TDA is sold under long-term contracts to a
small number of customers.

EQUIPMENT

The Company designs and manufactures equipment for cryogenic air
separation, gas processing, natural gas liquefaction, and hydrogen
purification. Air Products also designs and builds systems for recovering
hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and low dew point gases
using membrane technology. This segment further designs and builds cryogenic
transportation containers for liquid helium and hydrogen. Customers include
companies involved in chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas
recovery and processing, power generation, and steel and primary metal
production. Additionally, a broad range of plant design, engineering,
procurement, and construction management services is provided for the above
areas. Equipment is manufactured for use by the gases segment and for sale in
industrial markets that include the Company’s international industrial gas
joint ventures.



The backlog of orders (including letters of intent) believed to be firm
from other companies and equity affiliates for equipment was approximately $297
million on 30 September 2004, approximately 30 percent of which relates to
cryogenic air separation, and 46 percent of which relates to liquefied natural
gas, as compared with a total backlog of approximately $259 million on 30
September 2003. It is expected that approximately $220 million of the backlog
on 30 September 2004 will be completed during fiscal year 2005.

GENERAL

Foreign Operations

Air Products, through subsidiaries and affiliates, conducts business in
numerous countries outside the United States. The structure of the Air Products
gas business in Europe is comparable to the Company’s United States operation,
except that in Europe the Company is also engaged in a broader packaged gas
business. Air Products’ international business is subject to risks customarily
encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates and controls, import and export controls, and other economic,
political, and regulatory policies of local governments.

The Company’s industrial gas segment, through investments ranging from
wholly owned subsidiaries to minority ownership interests, does business in
approximately 35 countries outside the United States. Majority and wholly owned
industrial gas subsidiaries operate in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico,
and throughout Europe and Asia in 16 and ten countries, respectively. There are
50 percent industrial gas joint ventures in Canada and Trinidad and Tobago,
seven countries in Europe, four in Asia, and two in Africa, and less than
controlling interests in Africa, Canada, and Mexico, four countries in Europe,
and five in Asia. The Company has a 50 percent joint venture in the U.K. that
is developing products relating to silicon wafer polishing, chemical mechanical
planarization processes, and hard disk polishing. The Company also has a 50
percent interest in a power generation facility in the Netherlands and a 48.8
percent interest in one in Thailand.

The principal geographic markets for the Company’s chemical products are
in 12 countries, with operations in North America, Europe, Asia, Brazil, and
Mexico. Majority and wholly owned subsidiaries operate in Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and
Mexico. The polymer emulsions and pressure-sensitive adhesives joint venture
with Wacker-Chemie GmbH has headquarters in the United States and production
facilities in the United States, Germany, Mexico, and Korea, along with a
technical service center in Shanghai, China. Headquarters for the 20 percent
investment in the redispersible powder venture with Wacker-Chemie GmbH are in
Germany with manufacturing facilities in Germany and the United States. The
Company also has controlling interests in Korea and Taiwan and less than
controlling interests in Japan and Ireland that sell chemicals to the
electronics industry.

Financial information about Air Products’ foreign operations and
investments is included in Notes 8, 17, and 21 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included under Item 8 herein. Information about foreign currency
translation is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included under Item 8 herein, under “Foreign Currency,” and information on
Company exposure to currency fluctuations is included in Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein. Export sales
from operations in the United States to unconsolidated customers amounted to
$496 million, $497 million, and $533 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and
2002, respectively. Total export sales in fiscal year 2004 included $301
million in export sales to affiliated customers. The sales to affiliated
customers were primarily equipment sales and electronic specialty materials
sales.

Technology Development

Air Products conducts research and development principally in its
laboratories located in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, as well as in Carlsbad,
California; Dublin, Ohio; and Easton, Pennsylvania in the U.S.; Basingstoke,
London, and Crewe in the U.K.; Burghausen, Germany; Utrecht, the Netherlands;
San Juan del Rio, Mexico; and Barcelona, Spain. The Company also funds and
works closely on research and development programs with a number of major
universities and conducts research work funded by others, principally the
United States Government.

The Company’s market-oriented approach to technology development
encompasses research and development and engineering, as well as commercial
development.

The amount expended by the Company on research and development during
fiscal year 2004 was $127 million, $121 million in fiscal year 2003, and $120
million in fiscal year 2002. The amount expended by the Company on customer-



sponsored research activities during fiscal year 2004 was $14 million, $15
million in fiscal year 2003, and $18 million in fiscal year 2002.

In the gases and equipment segments, technology development is directed
primarily to developing new and improved processes and equipment for the
production and delivery of industrial gases, electronic specialty gases,
electronic specialty chemicals, and hydrocarbons; developing new
products; and
developing new and improved applications for such products. It is through such
applications and improvements that the Company has become a major supplier to
the electronics and chemical process industries, including gases from air
separation, specialty gases, and hydrogen. Additionally, technology development
for the equipment business is directed primarily to reducing the capital and
operating costs of its facilities and to commercializing new technologies in
gas production, liquefaction, and separation.

In the chemicals segment, technology development is primarily concerned
with new products and applications to strengthen and extend the Company’s
present positions in polymer and performance materials. In addition, a major
continuing effort supports the development of new and improved process and
manufacturing technology for chemical intermediates and polymers.

A corporate research group supports the research efforts of the Company’s
various businesses. This group includes the Company’s Corporate Science and
Technology Center, which conducts research in areas important to the long-term
growth of the Company with focus on performance materials.

As of 1 November 2004, Air Products owned 1,061 United States patents and
2,102 foreign patents. The Company is also licensed under certain patents owned
by others. While the patents and licenses are considered important, Air
Products does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent
upon any particular patent or patent license, or group of patents or licenses.

Raw Materials and Energy

The Company manufactures hydrogen, carbon monoxide, synthesis gas, and
carbon dioxide principally from natural gas. Such products accounted for
approximately 13 percent of the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year
2004. The Company’s principal raw material purchases are chemical intermediates
produced by others from basic petrochemical feedstocks such as olefins and
aromatic hydrocarbons. These feedstocks are generally derived from various
crude oil fractions or from liquids extracted from natural gas. The Company
purchases its chemical intermediates from many sources and generally is not
dependent on one supplier. However, with respect to vinyl acetate monomer that
supports the performance polymer business, the Company is heavily dependent on
a single supplier under a long-term contract that produces vinyl acetate
monomer from several facilities. The Company characterizes the availability of
these chemical intermediates as generally being readily available. The Company
uses such raw materials in the production of emulsions, amines, polyurethane
intermediates, specialty additives, polyurethane additives, and epoxy
additives. Such products accounted for approximately 26 percent of the
Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2004. Natural gas is an energy
source at a number of the Company’s facilities. The Company also purchases
ammonia under long-term contracts as a feedstock for several of its chemicals
facilities. During 2005, the Company will begin purchasing methanol under a
long-term supply arrangement. Methanol, produced from natural gas, is a
feedstock in methylamine production.

A long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of
dinitrotoluene (DNT), emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2003. To
facilitate the supplier’s ability to emerge from bankruptcy and to continue
supplying product to the Company, the Company agreed to participate in the
supplier’s financing and has continued to provide additional financing. Total
loans to the supplier at 30 September 2004 totaled $55.3 million. If the
supplier does not continue to operate, the sales and profitability of the
chemicals segment could be materially impacted on an annual basis because of
the Company’s inability to supply all of its customers’ base requirements. The
Company does not expect a material loss related to this supplier.

The Company’s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of
electrical power. Electricity is the largest cost input for the production of
atmospheric gases. Any shortage of electrical power or interruption of its
supply or increase in its price that cannot be passed through to customers for
competitive reasons will adversely affect the liquid bulk gas business of the
Company.

In addition, the Company purchases finished and semi-finished materials
and chemical intermediates from many suppliers. During fiscal year 2004, no
significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of
energy or raw materials.



Environmental Controls

The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in
the United States and foreign countries where it has operations. Compliance
with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and
costs. Additionally, from time to time, the Company is involved in proceedings
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(the federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for
investigation and possible cleanup. Additional information with respect to
these proceedings is included under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, below. The
Company’s accounting policies on environmental expenditures are discussed in
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein.

The amounts charged to earnings on an after-tax basis related to
environmental matters totaled $32 million in 2004, $30 million in 2003, and $24
million in 2002. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance
with environmental laws, as well as remedial activities, and costs incurred to
meet internal Company standards. Such costs are estimated to be $32 million in
2005 and $33 million in 2006.

Although precise amounts are difficult to define, the Company estimates
that in fiscal year 2004 it spent approximately $18 million on capital projects
to control pollution versus $16 million in 2003. Capital expenditures to
control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately $15 million in
2005 and $17 million in 2006.

To the extent long-term contracts have been entered into for supply of
product, such as for the industrial gas on-site business and for certain
chemical products, the cost of any environmental compliance generally is
contractually passed through to the customer.

It is the Company’s policy to accrue environmental investigatory and
noncapital remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $9 million to
a reasonably possible upper exposure of $19 million. The accrual on the balance
sheet for 30 September 2004 was $14 million and for 30 September 2003 was $15
million. Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the
estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures.
Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the
Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with
environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above
would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations in any one year.

Competition

The Company’s businesses face strong competition from others, some of
which are larger and have greater resources than Air Products.

Air Products’ industrial gas business competes in the United States with
three major sellers and with several regional sellers. Competition in
industrial gas markets is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and
furnishing or developing applications for use of such gases by customers, and
in some cases the provisions of other services or products such as power and
steam generation. Similar competitive situations exist in European and Asian
industrial gas markets in which the Company competes against one or more larger
entrenched competitors in most countries.

The division of the Company’s gas business that serves the electronics
industry offers electronic specialty gases, chemicals, services, and equipment.
These products face competition from competitors who vary from product to
product, ranging from niche suppliers having only a single product, to larger
and more vertically integrated chemical companies with greater financial
resources than the Company. Competition in these products is principally on the
basis of price, quality, product performance, and reliability of product
supply.

Competition in the institutional market of the global healthcare business
is principally from other large, established industrial gas companies using
business models (long-term product supply agreements) that are similar to those
the companies utilize for other industrial gas supply relationships.
Competition in this market is principally based on price, quality, service, and
reliability of supply. Homecare is served by national and local providers, and
in the U.S. there are over 2,000 regional and local providers. The homecare
market is highly competitive. In the United States reimbursement levels are
established by fee schedules regulated by Medicare and Medicaid, or by the
levels negotiated with insurance companies. Accordingly, in the United States,
homecare companies compete primarily on the basis of service. Maintaining
competitiveness requires efficient logistics, reimbursement, and accounts
receivable systems. The Company intends to attempt to acquire additional
homecare companies, provided that such companies can be acquired on terms
deemed reasonable by management.



The number of the Company’s principal competitors in the chemicals
business varies from product to product, and it is not practical to identify
such competitors because of the broad range of the Company’s chemical products
and the markets served, although the Company believes it has a leading or
strong market position in most of its chemical products. For amines the
competition is principally from other large chemical companies that also have
the ability to provide competitive pricing, reliability of supply, technical
service assistance, and quality products and services. The possibility of back
integration by large customers is the major competitive factor for the sale of
polyurethane additives. In its other chemical products, the Company competes
with a large number of chemical companies, some of which are larger, possess
greater financial resources, and are more vertically integrated than the
Company. Competition in these products is principally on the basis of price,
quality, product performance, reliability of product supply, and technical
service assistance.

The Company’s equipment business competes in all aspects with a great
number of firms, some of which have greater financial resources than Air
Products. Competition is based primarily on technological performance, service,
technical know-how, price, and performance guarantees.

Insurance

The Company’s policy is to obtain public liability and property insurance
coverage that is currently available at what management determines to be a fair
and reasonable price. The Company maintains public liability and property
insurance coverage at amounts that management believes are sufficient to meet
the Company’s anticipated needs in light of historical experience to cover
future litigation and claims. There is no assurance, however, that the Company
will not incur losses beyond the limits of, or outside the coverage of, its
insurance.

Employees

On 30 September 2004, the Company (including majority-owned subsidiaries)
had approximately 19,900 employees of whom 19,300 were full-time employees, and
of whom approximately 9,200 were located outside the United States. The Company

adverse impact on the Company.

ITEM 2. Properties.

The principal executive offices of Air Products are located at its
headquarters in Trexlertown, near Allentown, Pennsylvania. Additional
administrative offices are located in owned facilities in Hersham, near London,
England and Hattingen, Germany. Administrative
offices are also located in leased facilities in the Allentown and Philadelphia
areas in Pennsylvania; Dublin, Ohio;
Mississauga, Ontario, Canada; Tokyo, Japan; Hong Kong, the People’s
Republic of China; Singapore; Brussels, Belgium; Paris, France; Barcelona,
Spain; and Sao Paulo, Brazil. The management considers the Company’s
manufacturing facilities, described in more detail below, to be adequate to
support the business efficiently. The following information with respect to
properties is as of 30 September 2004.

Gases

In the United States, the gases segment has approximately 200 plant
facilities in 34 states, the majority of which recover nitrogen, oxygen, and
argon. The Company has three facilities that produce specialty gases, three
facilities that clean electronic parts, three facilities that produce
electronic chemicals, and 27 facilities that produce and/or recover hydrogen
throughout the United States. Helium is recovered at two plants in Kansas and
Texas. There are 16 sales offices



located in 9 states. The property on which these plants are located is owned
by Air Products at approximately one-fourth of the locations, and leased by Air
Products at the remaining locations. However, in virtually all cases, the plant
itself is owned and operated by Air Products. Air Products owns approximately
25 percent of its industrial gas sales offices and cylinder distribution
centers, including related real estate, and leases the other 75 percent.

Air Products’ European plant facilities total 61 and include seven
facilities that recover hydrogen, five facilities that manufacture dissolved
acetylene, one facility that recovers carbon monoxide, and two facilities that
produce electronic chemicals. The majority of European plants recover nitrogen,
oxygen, and argon. In addition, there are five specialty gas centers. There are
105 sales offices and/or cylinder distribution centers in Europe, and several
additional facilities located in Brazil, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the Middle
East.

In Asia the gases segment has approximately 97 plant facilities in eight
countries, including three equipment manufacturing facilities, an electronic
chemicals facility, and eight facilities that produce and/or recover hydrogen.
The property on which these plants are located is owned by Air Products at
approximately one-fifth of the locations, and leased by Air Products at the
remaining locations. There are approximately 40 sales offices and distribution
centers located throughout the region, half of which are owned sites and the
remainder leased. Representative offices are located in Taiwan and in Hong
Kong, Beijing, and Shanghai in the People’s Republic of China.

Global healthcare has 173 facilities in the United States, Canada,
Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and five countries in Europe. The
majority of the facilities for global healthcare are leased.

Chemicals

The chemicals segment manufactures amines, nitric acid, and ammonia
products at its Pace, Florida facility; alkylamines at its St. Gabriel,
Louisiana facility and its Camacari, Bahia, Brazil facility; polyvinyl acetate
emulsions at its South Brunswick, New Jersey facility; dinitrotoluene at its
Geismar, Louisiana facility; polyvinyl acetate emulsions at its Cologne,
Germany facility; nitric acid, dinitrotoluene, and toluene diamine at its
Pasadena, Texas facility; polyvinyl acetate emulsions and acetylenic chemicals
at its Calvert City, Kentucky facility; specialty amines at its Wichita, Kansas
facility; and epoxy additives at its facilities in Manchester, England, and Los
Angeles, California. The chemicals segment manufactures polyurethane additives
and polyurethane specialty products
(AIRTHANE

®

/VERSATHANE

®

) at its Paulsboro,
New Jersey facility that is leased in part and owned in part. The chemicals
segment also manufactures polyvinyl acetate emulsions at four smaller
locations.

The chemicals segment has 12 plant facilities, two sales offices, and one
laboratory in the United States, and operates three plants, three
sales/representative offices, and two laboratories in Europe, two laboratories
in Brazil and Japan, one plant in Brazil, one plant in each of Singapore and
Korea, and sales offices in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, the People’s Republic of
China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore, and representative offices in Beijing,
Shanghai, and Hong Kong in the People’s Republic of China. Substantially all of
the chemicals segment’s plants and real estate are owned. The Company leases
approximately 75 percent of the offices and 25 percent are owned.

Equipment

The principal facilities utilized by the equipment segment include six
plants and two sales offices in the United States, two plants and one office in
Europe, four offices in Japan and the People’s Republic of China, and three
plants in Korea, Taiwan, and the People’s Republic of China. Air Products owns
approximately 50 percent of the facilities and real estate in this segment and
leases the remaining 50 percent.

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of business Air Products and its subsidiaries are
involved in legal proceedings including proceedings involving governmental
authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act (the federal Superfund law); the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state environmental laws relating to the
designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there
are approximately 40 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached
where the Company, along with others, has been designated a Potentially
Responsible Party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise
engaged in investigation or remediation. The Company does not expect that any
sums it may have to pay in connection with these matters would have a
materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, nor is there
any material additional
exposure expected in



any one year in excess of the amounts the Company
currently has accrued. Additional information on the Company’s environmental
exposure is included under “Environmental Controls.”

ITEM 4. Submission of
Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Not applicable.

PART II

ITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and

The Company’s Common Stock, ticker symbol “APD,” is listed on the New York
and Pacific Stock Exchanges. Quarterly stock prices, as reported on the New
York Stock Exchange composite tape of transactions, and dividend information
for the last two fiscal years appear below. Cash dividends on Air Products’
common stock are paid quarterly. The Company’s objective is to pay dividends
consistent with the reinvestment of earnings necessary for long-term growth.

It is the Company’s expectation that comparable cash dividends will continue to
be paid in the future.

Represents Long-Term Incentive Plan outstanding options and deferred
stock units (“DSUs”) that have been granted. DSUs entitle the recipient
to one share of Company common stock upon earn out, which is conditioned
on continued employment during the deferral period and may also be
conditioned on meeting certain performance targets. The deferral period
generally ends upon death, disability, or retirement.

(2)

Represents authorized shares that were available for future grants as
of 30 September 2004. These shares may be used for options, DSUs,
restricted stock, and other stock-based awards to officers, directors,
and key employees.

(3)

Represents outstanding options under Global Employee Stock Awards
(2,381,283), the Stock Incentive Plan (1,989,930), the Stock Option Plan
for Directors (96,000), and the U.K. Savings-Related Share Option
Schemes (774,108). This number also includes DSUs under the Deferred
Compensation Plan for Directors (91,720), the Annual Incentive Plan
(36,966), and the Supplementary Savings Plan (41,648). DSUs issued under
these plans are purchased for the fair market value of the underlying shares of stock with eligible deferred compensation, except for that
portion of directors fees that is paid in DSUs as described above.

(4)

The number also includes a reserve of (887,167) shares available for
stock option awards under the U.K. Savings-Related Share Option Schemes,
a (250,000) reserve for the Annual Incentive Plan and Supplementary
Savings Plan and (250,000) reserve for the Deferred Compensation Plan
for Directors.

Global Employee Stock Option Awards and Stock Incentive Program

– All
stock options under these plans were granted at fair market value on the date
of grant, first become exercisable three years after grant, and terminate ten
years after the date of grant or upon the earlier termination of employment for
reasons other than retirement, disability, death, or
involuntary termination due to Company action necessitated by business
conditions. No further awards will be made under these plans.



Stock Option Plan for Directors

– All stock options under this plan were
granted at fair market value on the date of grant. The options become
exercisable in six months after grant and remain exercisable for nine and
one-half years unless the director resigns from our Board after serving for
less than six years (other than because of disability or death). No further
awards will be made under this plan.

The Air Products PLC U.K. Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and the Air
Products Group Limited U.K. Savings-Related Share Option Scheme

(together, the
“U.K. Plan”) are employee benefit plans for employees of Air Products PLC (and
certain of its U.K. subsidiaries) and Air Products Group Limited (and certain
of its U.K. subsidiaries), respectively (together, the “U.K. Companies”).
Employees participate in the U.K. Plan by electing to do so during a brief
invitation period. An employee who elects to participate elects a five- or
seven-year option period and has amounts of salary automatically withheld and
contributed to a savings account at a bank not affiliated with the Company. At
the end of the five-year savings period, a tax-free bonus is added to the
employee’s account. An employee who elects a seven-year option and retains his
savings account for seven years receives a further bonus at the end of the
seventh year. At the end of the option period, the participant may use his
savings to purchase shares of Company Stock at the fixed option price or
receive in cash the amount of his savings and bonus(es). His election must be
made within six months of the close of the option period. The option price is
an amount determined by the directors of the U.K. Company on the date the
option is granted, which may not be less than 90 percent of Market Value (as
defined in the U.K. Plan) on the date of grant.

Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors

- Our compensation plan for
non-employee directors mandates that one-half of each director’s quarterly
retainer is paid in DSUs. Directors have the opportunity to purchase more DSUs
with up to all of the rest of their retainers and meeting fees. Retainer and
meeting fee dollars (plus dividend equivalents earned on the director’s
existing DSU account during the quarter) are converted to DSUs based on the
market value of a share of Company Stock on the second business day preceding
the date the dollars would have been paid to the director. (Retainers and
meeting fees are paid quarterly in arrears.) New directors and directors
continuing in office after our annual meetings were awarded 1,000 DSUs. Each
DSU also accrues dividend equivalents which are equal to the dividends that
would have been paid on a share of stock during the period the DSUs are
outstanding. Accumulated dividend equivalents are converted to DSUs on a
quarterly basis. DSUs provide our directors with the financial equivalent of
owning Company Stock participating in quarterly dividend reinvestment, which
they cannot sell until after they leave our Board, except that DSUs have no
voting rights. Directors may transfer DSUs by gift to family members.

The Annual Incentive Plan

is the annual cash bonus plan for executives and
key salaried employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Terms applicable to
the Plan were approved by shareholders in order to permit the continued
exclusion of compensation payable under it from the deduction limitations
imposed by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan is
administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”). All or a portion of bonuses
granted to a participant may be deferred at the election of the participant or
at the discretion of the Compensation Committee (“Deferred Awards”).

The dollar amount of Deferred Awards granted to a participant is initially
credited to an unfunded account that earns interest credits. Participants with
Deferred Awards are periodically permitted while employed by the Company to
irrevocably convert all or a portion of their accounts to an account deemed to
be invested in Company Stock. Upon conversion, the Company Stock account is
credited with deferred stock units (“DSUs”) based on the fair market value of a
share of Company Stock on the date of crediting. Dividend equivalents
corresponding to the number of DSUs are credited quarterly to the
interest-bearing account. DSUs are paid after, but no later than ten years
after, termination of employment in shares of Company Stock, unless the
Compensation Committee determines otherwise. Upon a change in control of the
Company, DSUs become payable immediately in cash.

The Company’s

Supplementary Savings Plan

is an unfunded employee
retirement benefit plan available to certain of the Company’s U.S.-based
management and other highly compensated employees (and those of its
subsidiaries) whose participation in the Company’s Retirement Savings and Stock
Ownership Plan (the “RSSOP”) is limited by federal tax laws. Participants may
defer a portion of base salary which cannot be contributed to the RSSOP because
of tax limitations (“Elective Deferrals”) and earn matching contributions from
the Company they would have received if their Elective Deferrals had been
contributed to the RSSOP (“Matching Credits”). The dollar amount of Elective
Deferrals and Matching
Credits is initially credited to an unfunded account, which earns interest
credits. Participants are periodically permitted while employed by the Company
to irrevocably convert all or a portion of their interest bearing account to
DSUs in a



Company Stock account. Conversion and crediting of earnings to, and
payments from, the Company Stock account is the same as described above as to
Deferred Awards granted under the Annual Incentive Plan.

The information set forth in the sections headed “Persons Owning More than
5% of Air Products Stock as of September 30, 2004,” and “Air Products Stock
Beneficially Owned by Officers and Directors as of November 1, 2004,” appearing
