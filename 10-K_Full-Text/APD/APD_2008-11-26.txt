PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND FISCAL YEAR 2008 DEVELOPMENTS

Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation originally founded in
1940, serves technology, energy, industrial and healthcare customers globally with a unique
portfolio of products, services and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty
gases, performance materials, equipment and services. The Company is the world’s largest supplier
of hydrogen and helium and has built leading positions in growth markets such as semiconductor
materials, refinery hydrogen, natural gas liquefaction and advanced coatings and adhesives. As used
in this Report, unless the context indicates otherwise, the term “Company” includes subsidiaries
and predecessors of the registrant and its subsidiaries.

In January 2008, the Company sold its interest in the vinyl acetate ethylene polymers joint
ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long time joint venture partner. The Company completed the sale
of the Polymers Emulsions business with the sale of the two remaining production facilities in
Elkton, Maryland and Piedmont, South Carolina and the related North American atmospheric emulsions
and pressure sensitive adhesives businesses in June. During fiscal 2008, the Company also sold the
High Purity Process Chemicals business which had previously been reported as part of the
Electronics and Performance Materials operating segment. In July 2008, the Board of Directors
authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. In September 2008, the
Company sold the healthcare business related to several New York and New Jersey locations, followed
by the sale of the seating and mobility unit in October.

Previously, the Company reported results for a Chemicals segment, which consisted of the Polymer
Emulsions business and the Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI) business, and a Healthcare segment.
Beginning with the first quarter of 2008, the Polymer Emulsions business was accounted for as
discontinued operations, and the PUI business was reported as part of the Tonnage Gases segment.
Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2008, the U.S. Healthcare business was accounted for as
discontinued operations and the Europe Healthcare business was reported as part of the Merchant
Gases segment. The Company now manages its operations, assesses performance and reports earnings
under four business segments: Merchant Gases; Tonnage Gases; Electronics and Performance Materials;
and Equipment and Energy.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

Financial information concerning the Company’s four business segments appears in Note 22 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENTS

MERCHANT GASES

Merchant Gases sells industrial gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and argon (primarily recovered by
the cryogenic distillation of air), hydrogen and helium (purchased or refined from crude helium),
and medical and specialty gases, along with certain services and equipment, throughout the world to
customers in many industries, including those in metals, glass, chemical processing, food
processing, healthcare, steel, general manufacturing and petroleum and natural gas industries.

Merchant Gases includes the following types of products:

(1)

“Liquid bulk”

— Product is delivered in bulk (in liquid or gaseous form) by tanker or tube
trailer and stored, usually in its liquid state, in equipment designed and installed by the
Company at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed. Liquid bulk sales
are typically governed by three-to-five year contracts.

(2)

“Packaged gases”

— Small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars.
The Company operates packaged gas businesses in Europe, Asia and Brazil. In the United States,
the Company’s packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic
resonance imaging (principally helium) industries.

(3)

“Small on-site plants”

— Customers receive product through small on-sites (cryogenic or
non-cryogenic generators) either by a sale of gas contract or the sale of the equipment to the
customer.



(4)

“Healthcare products”

— Customers receive respiratory therapies, home medical equipment and
infusion services. These products and services are provided to patients in their homes,
primarily in Europe. The Company has leading market positions in Spain, Portugal, the United
Kingdom and Mexico through its equity affiliate.

Electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases — oxygen,
nitrogen and argon. Natural gas is also an energy source at a number of the Company’s Merchant
Gases facilities. The Company mitigates energy and natural gas prices through pricing formulas and
surcharges. A shortage or interruption of electricity or natural gas supply, or a price increase
that cannot be passed through to customers, possibly for competitive reasons, may adversely affect
the operations or results of Merchant Gases. During fiscal year 2008, no significant difficulties
were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw materials; however, the Company
did experience significant increases in energy costs in most regions, resulting in the need to
increase industrial gas pricing.

Merchant Gases competes worldwide against three global industrial gas companies: L’Air Liquide
S.A., Linde AG and Praxair, Inc., and several regional sellers (including Airgas, Inc.).
Competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price, reliability of supply and the
development of industrial gas applications. Competition in the healthcare business involves
regulatory compliance, price, quality, service and reliability of supply. In Europe, primary
competitors include the same three global industrial gas companies mentioned previously.

Merchant Gases sales constituted approximately 40.3 percent of
the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2008, 38.9 percent
in fiscal year 2007 and 38.1 percent in fiscal year 2006.
Sales of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen and argon) constituted approximately 18 percent of the
Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2008, 19 percent in fiscal year 2007 and 20 percent in
fiscal year 2006.

TONNAGE GASES

Tonnage Gases provides hydrogen, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, oxygen and syngas principally to the
energy production and refining, chemical and metallurgical industries worldwide. Gases are produced
at large facilities located adjacent to customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from
centrally-located production facilities and are generally governed by contracts with fifteen to
twenty year terms. The Company is the world’s largest provider of hydrogen, which is used by oil
refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of
gasoline and diesel fuels to reduce smog and ozone depletion. The energy production industry uses
nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification. The
metallurgical industry utilizes nitrogen for inerting and oxygen for the manufacture of steel and
certain non-ferrous metals. The chemical industry uses hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide
and synthesis gas (a hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixture) as feedstocks in the production of many
basic chemicals. The Company delivers product through pipelines from centrally located facilities
in or near the Texas Gulf Coast; Los Angeles, California; Louisiana; Alberta, Canada; Rotterdam,
the Netherlands; Southern England, U.K.; Northern England, U.K. to Western Belgium; Ulsan, Korea;
Tangshan, China; Kuan Yin, Taiwan; Singapore; and Camaçari, Brazil. The Company owns less than
controlling interests in pipelines located in Thailand, Singapore and South Africa.

Tonnage Gases also includes a Polyurethanes Intermediate (PUI) business. At its Pasadena, Texas
facility, the Company produces di-nitrotoluene (“DNT”) which is converted to toluene diamine
(“TDA”) and sold for use as an intermediate in the manufacture of a major precursor of flexible
polyurethane foam used in furniture cushioning, carpet underlay, bedding and seating in
automobiles. Most of the Company’s TDA is sold under long-term contracts with raw material cost and
currency pass-through to a small number of customers. The Company employs proprietary technology
and scale of production to differentiate its polyurethane intermediates from those of its
competitors.

Natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen, carbon monoxide and synthesis gas
production. Electric power is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases.
The Company mitigates energy and natural gas prices through long-term cost-pass-through contracts.
Toluene, ammonia and hydrogen are the principal raw materials for the PUI business and are
purchased from various suppliers under multi-year contracts. During fiscal year 2008, no
significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw
materials.

Tonnage Gases competes in the United States and Canada against three global industrial gas
companies: L’Air Liquide S.A., Linde AG and Praxair, Inc., and several regional sellers for gases.
Competition is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, the development of applications
that use industrial gases, and, in some cases, provision of other services or products such as
power and steam generation. Similar competitive situations exist in the European and Asian
industrial gas markets where the Company competes against the three global companies as well as
regional competitors. Global competitors for the PUI business are primarily BASF Corporation and
Bayer AG.

Tonnage Gases sales constituted approximately 34 percent of the Company’s consolidated sales in
fiscal year 2008, 32 percent in fiscal year 2007 and 32 percent in fiscal year 2006. Tonnage Gases
hydrogen sales constituted approximately



17 percent of the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal
year 2008, 17 percent in fiscal year 2007 and 16 percent in fiscal year 2006.

ELECTRONICS AND PERFORMANCE MATERIALS

Electronics and Performance Materials employs applications technology to provide solutions to a
broad range of global industries through chemical synthesis, analytical technology, process
engineering and surface science. This segment provides the electronics industry with specialty
gases (such as nitrogen trifluoride, silane, arsine, phosphine, white ammonia, silicon
tetrafluoride, carbon tetrafluoride, hexafluoromethane, critical etch gases and tungsten
hexafluoride), as well as tonnage gases (primarily nitrogen), specialty chemicals, services and
equipment for the manufacture of silicon and compound semiconductors, thin film transistor liquid
crystal displays and photovoltaic devices. These products are delivered through various supply
chain methods, including bulk delivery systems or distribution by pipelines such as those located
in California’s Silicon Valley; Phoenix, Arizona; Tainan, Taiwan; Gumi and Giheung, Korea; and
Tianjin and Shanghai, China.

Electronics and Performance Materials also provides performance materials for a wide range of
products, including coatings, inks, adhesives, civil engineering, personal care, institutional and
industrial cleaning, mining, oil refining and polyurethanes, and focuses on the development of new
materials aimed at providing unique functionality to emerging markets. Principal performance
materials include polyurethane catalysts and other additives for polyurethane foam, epoxy amine
curing agents and auxiliary products for epoxy systems and specialty surfactants for formulated
systems.

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials, including
alcohols, ethyleneamines, cyclohexamine, acrylonitriles and glycols. During fiscal year 2008, no
significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of energy or raw
materials.

The Electronics and Performance Materials segment faces competition on a product-by-product basis
against competitors ranging from niche suppliers with a single product to larger and more
vertically integrated companies. Competition is principally conducted on the basis of price,
quality, product performance, reliability of product supply, technical innovation, service and
global infrastructure.

Total sales from Electronics and Performance Materials constituted approximately 21 percent of the
Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal year 2008, 23 percent in fiscal year 2007 and 23 percent in
fiscal year 2006.

EQUIPMENT AND ENERGY

Equipment and Energy designs and manufactures cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air
separation (utilizing membrane technology and adsorption technology), hydrocarbon recovery and
purification, natural gas liquefaction (known as “LNG”) and helium distribution (cryogenic
transportation containers), and serves energy markets in a variety of ways.

Equipment is sold globally to customers in the chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and
gas recovery and processing and steel and primary metals processing industries. The segment also
provides a broad range of plant design, engineering, procurement and construction management
services to its customers.

Energy markets are served through the Company’s operation and partial ownership of cogeneration and
flue gas desulphurization facilities and its development of hydrogen as an energy carrier and
oxygen-based technologies to serve energy markets in the future. The Company owns and operates a
cogeneration facility in Calvert City, Kentucky; operates and owns fifty percent interests in a
49-megawatt fluidized-bed coal-fired power generation facility in Stockton, California and a
24-megawatt gas-fired combined-cycle power generation facility near Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and
operates and owns a 47.9 percent interest in a 112-megawatt gas-fueled power generation facility in
Thailand. The Company also operates and owns a fifty percent interest in a flue gas
desulphurization facility in Indiana.

Steel, aluminum and capital equipment subcomponents (compressors, etc.) are the principal raw
materials in the equipment portion of this segment. Adequate raw materials for individual projects
are acquired under firm purchase agreements. Coal, petroleum coke and natural gas are the largest
cost components in the production of energy. The Company mitigates these cost components, in part,
through long-term cost-pass-through contracts. During fiscal year 2008, no significant difficulties
were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials.

Equipment and Energy competes with a great number of firms for all of its offerings except LNG heat
exchangers, for which there are fewer competitors due to the limited market size and proprietary
technologies. Competition is based primarily on technological performance, service, technical
know-how, price and performance guarantees.

The backlog of equipment orders (including letters of intent believed to be firm) from third party
customers (including equity affiliates) was approximately $399 million on 30 September 2008,
approximately 76 percent of which is for



cryogenic air separation equipment and 8 percent of which
is for LNG heat exchangers, as compared with a total backlog of
approximately $258 million on 30 September 2007. The Company expects that approximately
$289 million of the backlog on 30 September 2008 will be completed during fiscal year 2009.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS GENERALLY

FOREIGN OPERATIONS

The Company, through subsidiaries, affiliates and minority-owned ventures, conducts business in
over forty countries outside the United States. Its international businesses are subject to risks
customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates and controls, import and export controls and other economic, political and regulatory
policies of local governments.

The Company has majority or wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in Canada, 17 European
countries (including the United Kingdom and Spain), 10 Asian countries (including China, Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan) and four Latin American countries (including Mexico and Brazil). The Company
also owns less-than-controlling interests in entities operating in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle
East and Latin America (including Italy, Germany, China, Korea, India, Singapore, Thailand, South
Africa and Mexico).

Financial information about the Company’s foreign operations and investments is included in Notes
8, 17 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 herein. Information
about foreign currency translation is included under “Foreign Currency” in Note 1 and information
on the Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations is included under “Currency Risk Management” in
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 below and in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under “Foreign Currency
Exchange Rate Risk” included under Item 7 below. Export sales from operations in the United States
to unaffiliated customers amounted to $629 million, $677 million and $709 million in fiscal years
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total export sales in fiscal year 2008 included $505 million in
export sales to affiliated customers. The sales to affiliated customers were primarily equipment
sales within the Equipment and Energy segment and Electronics and Performance Materials sales.

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

The Company pursues a market-oriented approach to technology development through research and
development, engineering and commercial development processes. It conducts research and development
principally in its laboratories located in the United States (Trexlertown, Pennsylvania; Carlsbad,
California; Milton, Wisconsin; and Phoenix, Arizona), the United Kingdom (Basingstoke, London and
Carrington); Germany (Hamburg); the Netherlands (Utrecht); Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and Asia
(Tokyo, Japan; Shanghai, China; Giheung, Korea; and Hsinchu, Taiwan). The Company also funds and
cooperates in research and development programs conducted by a number of major universities and
undertakes research work funded by others — principally the United States Government.

The Company’s corporate research groups, which include materials, process and analytical centers,
support the research efforts of various businesses throughout the Company. Technology development
efforts for use within Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases and Equipment and Energy focus primarily on
new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases and
new or improved applications for all such products. Research and technology development for
Electronics and Performance Materials is primarily concerned with development of new products and
applications to strengthen and extend the Company’s present positions. Work is also performed in
Electronics and Performance Materials to lower processing costs and develop new processes for the
new products.

Research and development expenditures were $131 million during fiscal year 2008, $129 million in
fiscal year 2007 and $140 million in fiscal year 2006, and the Company expended $25 million on
customer-sponsored research activities during fiscal year 2008, $19 million in fiscal year 2007 and
$21 million in fiscal year 2006.

As of 1 November 2008, the Company owned 983 United States patents and 3,030 foreign patents and is
a licensee under certain patents owned by others. While the patents and licenses are considered
important, the Company does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon
any particular patent, patent license or group of patents or licenses.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS

The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it
has operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures
and costs. From time to time the Company is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state
laws and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the



designation of
certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. Additional information with respect to these
proceedings is included under Item 3, Legal Proceedings, below. The Company’s accounting policies
on environmental expenditures are discussed in Note 1 and particulars on environmental loss
contingencies are provided in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item
8 below.

The amounts charged to income from continuing operations on an after-tax basis related to
environmental matters totaled $31 million in fiscal 2008, $25 million in 2007 and $26 million in
2006. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws,
remedial activities and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Such costs are
estimated to be $22 million in 2009 and $23 million in 2010.

Although precise amounts are difficult to define, the Company estimates that in fiscal year 2008 it
spent approximately $7 million on capital projects to control pollution versus $11 million in 2007.
Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated at approximately $8 million
in 2009 and $7 million in 2010. The cost of any environmental compliance generally is contractually
passed through to the customer.

The Company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it
is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $82 million to a reasonably
possible upper exposure of $95 million. The accrual on the balance sheet for 30 September 2008 was
$82.9 million and for 30 September 2007 was $52.2 million. Actual costs to be incurred in future
periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental
exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company does
not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of
the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse effect on its financial
condition or results of operations in any one year.

EMPLOYEES

On 30 September 2008, the Company (including majority-owned subsidiaries) had approximately 21,100
employees, of whom approximately 20,600 were full-time employees and of whom approximately 11,600
were located outside the United States. The Company has collective bargaining agreements with
unions at various locations that expire on various dates over the next four years. The Company
considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory and does not believe that the impact of
any expiring or expired collective bargaining agreements will result in a material adverse impact
on the Company.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

The Company operates in over 40 countries around the world and faces a variety of risks and
uncertainties that could materially affect its future operations and financial performance. Many
of these risks and uncertainties are not within the Company’s control. Risks that may
significantly impact the Company include the following:

Overall Economic Conditions – Weakening general economic conditions in markets in which the Company
does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services or its profitability.

Demand for the Company’s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions
affecting the countries and industries in which the Company does business. Currently, deteriorating
economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries and in industries served by the Company may
negatively impact demand for the Company’s products and services, in turn negatively impacting the
Company’s revenues and earnings. Excess capacity in the Company’s or its competitors’ manufacturing
facilities could decrease the Company’s ability to generate profits. Unanticipated contract
terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results.

Asset
Impairments – The Company may be required to record an impairment
on its long lived assets.

Weakening
demand may create underutilization of the Company’s  manufacturing capacity or elimination of
product lines; contract terminations or customer shut downs may force sale or abandonment of
facilities and equipment; contractual provisions may allow customer buy out of facilities or
equipment; or other events associated with weakening economic conditions or specific product or
customer events may require the Company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as
facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill,
which would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results.

Competition – Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and
financial performance.

The Company faces strong competition from several large, global competitors and many smaller
regional ones in all of its business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies,
competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the
Company’s products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors’ pricing
policies can materially affect pricing of the Company’s products or its market share, causing an
adverse impact on revenues and/or profitability.



Raw Material and Energy Cost and Availability – Interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an
inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost
sales or reduced profitability.

Energy, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost
component of the Company’s business. Because the Company’s industrial gas facilities use
substantial amounts of electricity, energy price fluctuations could materially impact the Company’s
revenues and earnings. Hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the
production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and synthesis gas. The Electronics and Performance
Materials segment uses a wide variety of raw materials, including alcohols, ethyleneamines,
cyclohexamines, acrylonitriles and glycols. Shortages or price escalation in these materials could
negatively impact financial results. A disruption in the supply of energy and raw materials,
whether due to market conditions, natural events or other disruption, could prevent the Company
from meeting its contractual commitments, harming its business and financial results.

The Company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its
customers, but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results. The Company may
not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full
recovery. Increases in energy or raw materials costs that cannot be passed on to customers for
competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the Company’s revenues and earnings. Even
where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.

Regulatory Changes – The Company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions
around the globe in which it does business. Changes in regulations addressing, among other things,
environmental compliance, import/export restrictions and taxes, can negatively impact the Company’s
operations and financial results.

The Company is subject to government regulation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in
which it conducts its business. Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require
additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs. Export controls or other regulatory
restrictions could prevent the Company from shipping Company products to and from some markets or increase
the cost of doing so. Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could
affect the financial results of the Company’s businesses.

Greenhouse Gases — Legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial
risk.

Some of the Company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulations
governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under
the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing
facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions
in California and Ontario. In addition, increased public awareness and concern may result in more
international, U.S. federal and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG.
Although uncertain, these developments could increase the Company’s costs related to consumption of
electric power, hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production. The Company believes it will
be able to mitigate some of the potential increased cost through its contractual terms, but the
lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate estimate of the
long-term impact on the Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could impact
the Company’s growth, increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products.

Environmental Compliance — Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental
regulations may negatively impact the Company’s operations and financial results.

The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental and safety laws
and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water
and the generation, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. The
Company takes it environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of
environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations. Future developments and more
stringent environmental regulations may require the Company to make additional unforeseen
environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures
for environmental protection equipment, compliance and remediation. These additional costs may
adversely affect financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see
“Narrative Description of the Company’s Business Generally — Environmental Controls” above.

Foreign Operations, Political and Legal Risks — The Company’s foreign operations can be adversely
impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights and legal
systems or political instability.

The Company’s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are subject to nationalization and
expropriation risk and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject
to cancellation without full compensation for loss. Economic and political conditions within
foreign jurisdictions, social unrest or strained relations between countries can



cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions or loss of property. The
occurrence of any of these risks could have a material, adverse impact on the Company’s operations
and financial results.

Interest Rate Fluctuations — The Company’s earnings, cash flow and financial position can be
impacted by interest rate increases.

At 30
September 2008, the Company had total consolidated debt of
 $3,966.8 million, of which
approximately $451.4 million  will mature in the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to
incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt. Although the Company actively
manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations, not
all borrowings at variable rates are hedged, and new debt will be priced at market rates. If
interest rates increase, the Company’s interest expense could increase significantly, affecting
earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions
and other purposes.

Currency Fluctuations — Changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the Company’s financial
results.

A substantial amount of the Company’s sales are derived from outside the United States, a
significant portion of which are denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also has
significant production facilities which are located outside of the United States. Financial results
therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Company uses certain financial
instruments to mitigate these effects, but it is not cost effective to hedge foreign currency
exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates
on earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities. Accordingly, reported sales, net
earnings, cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in
foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see “Market Ratio and
Sensitivity Analysis” included in Item 7A below.

Catastrophic Events – Catastrophic events could disrupt the Company’s operations or the operations
of its suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on the Company’s business, financial
results and cash flow.

The Company’s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the Company’s control,
including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and storms; health
epidemics and pandemics; or acts of war and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious
business disruption that could affect the Company’s ability to produce and distribute its products
and possibly expose it to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact the
Company’s suppliers, in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the Company, or
its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the Company’s products and services. Any such
occurrence could have a negative impact on the Company’s operations and financial results.

Operational Risks – Operational and execution risks may adversely affect the Company’s operations
or financial results.

The Company’s operation of its facilities, pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails
hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire,
explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures or vehicle accidents. If operational risks
materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment or loss of production,
all of which could negatively impact the Company’s on-going operations, financial results and cash
flow. The Company’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production
facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements. Insufficient capacity may expose the
Company to liabilities related to contract commitments. Operating results are also dependent on the
Company’s ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget and in accordance with
performance requirements. Failure to do so may expose the business to loss of revenue, potential
litigation and loss of business reputation.

Information Security — The security of the Company’s information technology systems could be
compromised, which could adversely affect its ability to operate.

The Company utilizes a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and other technologies for
the distribution of information both within the Company and to customers and suppliers. The ERP
system and other technologies are potentially vulnerable to interruption from viruses, hackers or
system breakdown. To mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented a variety of security
measures, including virus protection, a state of the art data center, redundancy procedures



and recovery processes. A significant system interruption, however, could materially affect the
Company’s operations, business reputation and financial results.

Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings — The Company’s financial results may be affected by various
legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving antitrust, environmental or other
matters.

The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business
and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. The
outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the
outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict.
Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and
related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not
susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a
significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future
adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in any particular period. For a more
detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company, see Note 19
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 below.

Recruiting and Retaining Employees — Inability to attract, retain or develop skilled employees
could adversely impact the Company’s business.

Sustaining and growing the Company’s business depend on the recruitment, development and
retention of qualified employees. Demographic trends and changes in the geographic concentration of
global businesses have created more competition for talent. The inability to attract, develop or
retain quality employees could negatively impact the Company’s ability to take on new projects and
sustain its operations which might adversely affect the Company’s operations or its ability to
grow.

Portfolio
Management — The success of portfolio management activities is
not predictable

The Company continuously reviews and manages its portfolio of assets in order to maximize value for its
shareholders. Portfolio management involves many variables, including future acquisitions and
divestitures, restructurings and resegmentations and cost-cutting and productivity initiatives. The
timing, impact and ability to complete such undertakings, the costs and financial charges
associated with such activities and the ultimate financial impact of
such undertakings are  uncertain
and can have a negative short or long-term impact on the Company’s operations and financial
results.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

The Company has not received any written comments from the Commission staff that remain unresolved.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

The Company owns its principal executive offices, which are located at its headquarters in
Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, and also owns additional principal administrative offices in Hersham,
near London, England and in Hattingen, Germany. Its principal Asian administrative offices, which
are leased, are located in Hong Kong; Shanghai, China; Taipei, Taiwan; and Singapore. Additional
administrative offices are leased in Ontario, Canada; Kawasaki, Japan; Seoul, Korea; Petaling
Jaya, Malaysia; Brussels, Belgium; Paris, France; Barcelona, Spain; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and
São Paulo, Brazil. Management believes the Company’s manufacturing facilities, described in more
detail below, are adequate to support its businesses.

Following is a description of the properties used by the Company’s four business segments:

MERCHANT GASES

Merchant Gases currently operates over 160 facilities across the United States and in Canada
(approximately 40 of which sites are owned), over 160 sites in Europe including healthcare
(approximately half of which sites are owned) and over 50 facilities in seven countries within Asia
and in Brazil. Helium is recovered at sites in Kansas and Texas and distributed from several
transfill sites in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Sales support offices are located at its Trexlertown
headquarters as well
as in leased properties in three states, at several sites in Europe and at 15 sites in Asia. R&D
activities for this segment are conducted in the Trexlertown, Pennsylvania laboratory facilities.



TONNAGE GASES

Tonnage Gases operates 50 plants in the United States and Canada that produce over 300 standard
tons-per-day of product. Over 30 of these facilities produce or recover hydrogen, many of which
support the three major pipeline systems located along the Gulf Coast of Texas, on the Mississippi
River corridor and in Los Angeles, California. The Tonnage Gases segment includes a facility in
Pasadena, Texas that produces Polyurethane Intermediate products. The segment also operates over 30
tonnage plants in Europe and 17 tonnage plants within Asia, the majority of which are on leasehold
type long term structured agreements. Sales support offices are located at the Company’s
headquarters in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, as well as in leased offices in Texas, Louisiana,
California and Calgary, Alberta.

ELECTRONICS AND PERFORMANCE MATERIALS

The electronics business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment produces,
packages and stores nitrogen, specialty gases and electronic chemicals at over 40 sites in the
United States (the majority of which are leased), nine facilities (including sales offices) in
Europe and over 40 facilities in Asia (approximately half of which are located on customer sites).

The performance materials portion of this segment operates facilities in Los Angeles, California;
Calvert City, Kentucky; Paulsboro, New Jersey; Wichita, Kansas; Milton, Wisconsin; Reserve,
Louisiana; Clayton, U.K.; Singapore; Isehara, Japan; and Changzhou, China. A specialty amines
facility is currently under construction in Nanjing, China. Substantially all of the performance
materials properties are owned.

This segment has eight field sales offices in the United States as well as sales offices in Europe,
Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and China, the majority of which are leased. The segment conducts R&D
related activities at nine locations worldwide.

EQUIPMENT AND ENERGY

Equipment and Energy operates seven manufacturing plants and two sales offices in the U.S. The
Company manufactures a significant portion of the world’s supply of LNG equipment at its
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania site. Air separation columns and cold boxes for Company-owned facilities
and third party sales are produced by operations in Acrefair in the United Kingdom and in Caojing,
China, as well as in the Wilkes-Barre facility when capacity is available. Cryogenic
transportation containers for liquid helium are manufactured and reconstructed at facilities in
eastern Pennsylvania and Liberal, Kansas. A new facility in Istres, France is scheduled for
start-up in 2009, which will reconstruct cryogenic transportation containers. Offices in Hersham,
United Kingdom and Shanghai, China house equipment commercial team members.

Electric power is produced at various facilities including Stockton, California; Calvert City,
Kentucky; and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Flue gas desulfurization operations are conducted at
the Pure Air facility in Chesterton, Indiana. Additionally, the Company owns a 47.9 percent
interest in a gas-fueled power generation facility in Thailand. The Company or its affiliates own
approximately 50 percent of the real estate in this segment and lease the remaining 50 percent.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

In the normal course of business the Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal
proceedings, including contract, product liability, intellectual property and insurance matters.
Although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of the
Company’s business, such litigation could result in large monetary awards, especially if a civil
jury is allowed to determine compensatory and/or punitive damages. However, the Company believes
that litigation currently pending to which it is a party will be resolved without any material
adverse effect on its financial position, earnings or cash flows.

The Company is also from time to time involved in certain competition, environmental, health and
safety proceedings involving governmental authorities. The Company is a party to proceedings under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (the federal Superfund
law); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state environmental laws
relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there are
approximately 31 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the Company, along
with others, has been designated a Potentially Responsible Party by the Environmental Protection
Agency or is otherwise
engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its manufacturing
sites. The Company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in connection with these
matters would have a materially adverse effect on its



consolidated financial position. Additional
information on the Company’s environmental exposure is included under “Narrative Description of the
Company’s Business Generally — Environmental Controls.”

On 13 March 2008, the Company was notified that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had made a
referral to the U.S. Department of Justice concerning alleged violations of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) related to sulfuric acid exchange at the Company’s Pasadena,
Texas facility. The Company disputes these allegations, has been in active discussions with the
Department of Justice on the matter and believes the matter will be resolved without legal action.
However, the Company cannot, at this time, reasonably predict the ultimate outcome of any
proceedings that might be instituted or the sanctions, if any, that could be imposed, but the
Company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in connection with this matter would have
a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or net cash flows.

During the third quarter of 2008, a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice issued a report
(previously issued in January, 2007, and then withdrawn) on its investigation of the Company’s
Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda. and several other Brazilian industrial gas
companies. The report recommended that the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense
impose sanctions on Air Products Brasil Ltda. and the other industrial gas companies for alleged
anticompetitive activities. The Company intends to defend this action and cannot, at this time,
reasonably predict the ultimate outcome of the proceedings or sanctions, if any, that will be
imposed. While the Company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in connection with this
or any other legal proceeding would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position or net cash flows, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a
significant impact on the Company’s net income in the period in which it is recorded.

Represents Long-Term Incentive Plan outstanding stock options and deferred stock units that

upon vesting, which is conditioned on continued employment during a deferral period and may also be
conditioned on earn out against certain performance targets.

(2)

Represents authorized shares that were available for future grants as of 30 September 2008.
These shares may be used for options, deferred stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based
awards to officers, directors and key employees. Full value awards such as restricted stock are
limited to 20% of cumulative awards.

(3)

Represents outstanding options under Global Employee Stock Awards (219,266), the Stock
Incentive Plan (868,963), the Stock Option Plan for Directors (36,000) and the U.K.
Savings-Related Share Option Schemes (109,385). This number also includes deferred stock units
granted under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors prior to 23 January 2003 (44,782) and
deferred stock units under the Deferred Compensation Plan (95,424). Deferred stock units issued
under the Deferred Compensation Plan are purchased for the fair market value of the underlying
shares of stock with eligible deferred compensation.

The following equity compensation plans or programs were not approved by shareholders. All of these
plans have either been discontinued or do not require shareholder approval because participants
forego current compensation equal to the full market value of any share units credited under the
plans.

Global Employee Stock Option Awards and Stock Incentive Program — No further awards will be made
under these programs. All stock options under these programs were granted at fair market value on
the date of grant, first became exercisable three years after grant, and terminate ten years after
the date of grant or upon the holder’s earlier termination of employment for reasons other than
retirement, disability, death or involuntary termination due to Company action necessitated by
business conditions.



Stock Option Plan for Directors — No further awards will be made under this plan. All stock options
under this plan were granted at fair market value on the date of grant. The options became
exercisable six months after grant and remain
exercisable for nine and one-half years or, if earlier, two years following the date the director
resigns from the Board (other than because of retirement, disability or death). This plan is no
longer offered. Stock options may now be granted to directors under the Long-Term Incentive Plan;
however, since September 2005, the compensation program for nonemployee directors has not provided
stock options.

The Air Products PLC U.K. Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and the Air Products Group Limited
U.K. Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (together, the “U.K. Plan”) are employee benefit plans for
employees of Air Products PLC (and certain of its U.K. subsidiaries) and Air Products Group Limited
(and certain of its U.K. subsidiaries), respectively (together, the “U.K. Companies”). No further
options will be offered under the U.K. Plan. Employees participate in the U.K. Plan by having
elected to do so during a brief invitation period. An employee who elected to participate chose a
five- or seven-year option period and has amounts of salary automatically withheld and contributed
to a savings account at a bank not affiliated with the Company. At the end of the five-year savings
period, a tax-free bonus is added to the employee’s account. An employee who elected a seven-year
option and retains his savings account for seven years receives a further bonus at the end of the
seventh year. At the end of the option period, the participant may use his savings to purchase
shares of Company stock at the fixed option price or receive in cash the amount of his savings and
bonus(es). His election must be made within six months of the close of the option period. The
option price is an amount determined by the directors of the U.K. Companies on the date the option
is granted, which may not be less than 90 percent of Market Value (as defined in the U.K. Plan) on
the date of grant.

Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors — This plan is no longer offered. It was the vehicle for
providing deferral stock units to the Company’s directors. The compensation program for nonemployee
directors provides that directors have the opportunity to purchase deferred stock units with their
retainers and meeting fees. New directors and directors continuing in office after the annual
meetings are awarded an annual grant of deferred stock units. Each deferred stock unit entitles the
director to one share of Company stock when paid out. Deferred stock units also accrue dividend
equivalents which are equal to the dividends that would have been paid on a share of stock during
the period the units are outstanding. Accumulated dividend equivalents are converted to deferred
stock units on a quarterly basis. Deferred stock units are now provided to directors under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan.

The Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded employee retirement benefit plan available
to certain of the Company’s U.S.-based management and other highly compensated employees (and those
of its subsidiaries) who receive awards under the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan, which is the
annual cash bonus plan for executives and key salaried employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Because participants forego current compensation to “purchase” deferred stock units
for full value under the Plan, it is not required to be approved by shareholders under the NYSE
listing standards. Under the Plan, participants may defer a portion of base salary which cannot be
contributed to the Company’s Retirement Savings Plan, a 401(k) and profit-sharing plan offered to
all salaried employees (“RSP”), because of tax limitations (“elective deferrals”) and earn matching
contributions from the Company that they would have received if their elective deferrals had been
contributed to the RSP (“matching credits”). In addition, participants in the Plan may defer all or
a portion of their bonus awards under the Annual Incentive Plan (“bonus deferrals”) under the
Deferred Compensation Plan. Finally, certain participants under the Plan who participate in the
profit-sharing component of the RSP rather than the Company’s salaried pension plans receive
contribution credits under the Plan which are a percentage of their salary ranging from 4-6% based
on their years of service (“contribution credits”). The dollar amount of elective deferrals,
matching credits, bonus deferrals and contribution credits is initially credited to an unfunded
account, which earns interest credits. Participants are periodically permitted while employed by
the Company to irrevocably convert all or a portion of their interest bearing account to deferred
stock units in a Company stock account. Upon conversion, the Company stock account is credited with
deferred stock units based on the fair market value of a share of Company stock on the date of
crediting. Dividend equivalents corresponding to the number of units are credited quarterly to the
interest-bearing account. Deferred stock units generally are paid after termination of employment
in shares of Company stock.

The Deferred Compensation Plan was formerly known as the Supplementary Savings Plan. The name was
changed in 2006 when the deferred bonus program, previously administered under the Annual Incentive
Plan, was merged into this Plan.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON SCHEDULE II

The Shareholders and Board of Directors of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.:

Under date of 25 November 2008, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of Air Products and
Chemicals, Inc. and subsidiaries as of 30 September 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
income statements and consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended 30 September 2008, as contained in the Annual Report to
Shareholders incorporated in the Form 10-K. In connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also
audited the related consolidated financial statement schedule referred to in Item 15 (a)(2) in this
Form 10-K. This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes,” effective 1 October 2007, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,” as of 30 September 2007,
and FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations,”
