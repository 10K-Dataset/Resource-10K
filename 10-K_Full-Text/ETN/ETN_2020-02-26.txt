Information by business segment regarding principal products, principal markets, methods of distribution and net sales is presented in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information regarding Eaton's segments and business is presented below.

Electrical Products and Electrical Systems and Services

Principal methods of competition in these segments are performance of products and systems, technology, customer service and support, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in these segments and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. In normal economic cycles, sales of these segments are historically lower in the first quarter and higher in the third and fourth quarters of a year. In


, 24% of these segments' sales were made to seven large distributors of electrical products and electrical systems and services.

Hydraulics

Principal methods of competition in this segment are product performance, geographic coverage, service, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. Sales of this segment are historically higher in the first and second quarters and lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year. In


, 13% of this segment's sales were made to five large original equipment manufacturers or distributors of agricultural, construction, and industrial equipment and parts.

Aerospace

Principal methods of competition in this segment are total cost of ownership, product and system performance, quality, design engineering capabilities, and timely delivery. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products and platforms, is considered among the market leaders. In


, 26% of this segment's sales were made to three large original equipment manufacturers of aircraft.

Vehicle

Principal methods of competition in this segment are product performance, technology, global service, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. In


, 61% of this segment's sales were made to ten large original equipment manufacturers of vehicles and related components.

Information Concerning Eaton's Business in General

Raw Materials

Eaton's major requirements for raw materials include iron, steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, brass, tin, silver, lead, titanium, rubber, plastic, electronic components, chemicals and fluids. Materials are purchased in various forms, such as extrusions, castings, powder metal, metal sheets and strips, forging billets, bar stock, and plastic pellets. Raw materials, as well as parts and other components, are purchased from many suppliers. Under normal circumstances, the Company has no difficulty obtaining its raw materials. In


, Eaton maintained appropriate levels of inventory to prevent shortages and did not experience any availability constraints.

Patents and Trademarks

Eaton considers its intellectual property, including without limitation patents, trade names, domain names, trademarks, confidential information, and trade secrets to be of significant value to its business as a whole. The Company's products are manufactured, marketed and sold under a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire in the future. Eaton develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and considers all of its intellectual property to be valuable. Based on the broad scope of the Company's product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on Eaton's consolidated financial statements or its business segments. The Company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements.

Order Backlog

A significant portion of open orders placed with Eaton are by original equipment manufacturers or distributors. These open orders are not considered firm as they have been historically subject to releases by customers. In measuring backlog orders, only the amount of orders to which customers are firmly committed are included. Using this criterion, total backlog at

December 31, 2019

and


was approximately

$5.4 billion

and

$5.3 billion

, respectively. Backlog should not be relied upon as being indicative of results of operations for future periods.

Environmental Contingencies

Operations of the Company involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws. Eaton continues to modify processes on an ongoing, regular basis in order to reduce the impact on the environment, including the reduction or elimination of certain chemicals used in, and wastes generated from, operations. Compliance with laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon earnings or the competitive position of the Company. Eaton's estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not expected to be material for


and


. Information regarding the Company's liabilities related to environmental matters is presented in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Among the risks that could materially adversely affect Eaton's businesses, financial condition or results of operations are the following:

Volatility of end markets that Eaton serves.

Eaton's segment revenues, operating results, and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future. Profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that Eaton serves. The Company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of the markets it serves and expansion of the geographic regions in which it operates. Future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues, operating results, and profitability.

Eaton's operating results depend in part on continued successful research,

development, and marketing of new and/or improved products and services, and

there can be no assurance that Eaton will continue to successfully introduce

new products and services or maintain its present market positions.

The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by Eaton's customers. The Company's businesses are affected, to varying degrees, by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles. Eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production, or marketing of new products and services which may prevent Eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. The Company's market positions may also be impacted by new entrants into Eaton's product or regional markets.



Eaton's operations depend on production facilities throughout the world, which subjects them to varying degrees of risk

of disrupted production.

Eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. The Company's manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strike, war, political unrest, terrorist activity, economic upheaval, or public health concerns such as the spread of COVID-19. Some of these conditions are more likely in certain geographic regions in which Eaton operates. Any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses.

If Eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, product or service offerings could be compromised or operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality lost.

Eaton relies on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. These technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; or computer viruses. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, breach, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the Company may suffer financial or reputational damage. Further

,

Cyber-based risks could also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third party products, facilities or infrastructure. Such attacks could result in disruptions to third party systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). Further, to a significant extent, the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are protected, configured, updated and monitored, all of which are typically outside our control.

Eaton's global operations subject it to economic risk as Eaton's

results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government legislation,

regulations and policies and currency fluctuations.

Operating globally subjects Eaton to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, data privacy, and exchange controls. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect Eaton's operating results. While the Company monitors exchange rate exposures and attempts to reduce these exposures through hedging activities, these risks could adversely affect operating results.

Further, existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have an impact on our business and financial results.

Eaton may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.

Eaton is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions around the world. Income tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax legislation, regulations, and policies. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities in the countries in which Eaton operates. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Company's tax liabilities.

Eaton uses a variety of raw materials and components in its businesses, and

significant shortages, price increases, or supplier insolvencies could increase

operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of Eaton's

products.

Eaton's major requirements for raw materials are described above in Item 1 “Raw Materials”. Significant shortages could affect the prices Eaton's businesses are charged and the competitive position of their products and services, all of which could adversely affect operating results.

Further, Eaton's suppliers of component parts may increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts. The Company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs, adversely affecting operating results.



Eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,

which could affect the Company's ability to compete.

Protecting Eaton's intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed. The Company owns a large number of patents and patent applications worldwide, as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary, and contribute significantly, to the preservation of Eaton's competitive position in various markets. Although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of Eaton or its business segments, there can be no assurance that any one, or more, of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the Company's employees, and into non-disclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers, so as to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information. These measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies.

Eaton is subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could

adversely impact Eaton's businesses.

At any given time, Eaton may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's businesses, financial condition or results of operations. Information regarding current legal proceedings is presented in Note 8 and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

Eaton's principal executive offices are located at Eaton House, 30 Pembroke Road, Dublin 4, Ireland D04 Y0C2. The Company maintains manufacturing facilities at approximately 284 locations in 41 countries. The Company is a lessee under a number of operating leases for certain real properties and equipment, none of which is material to its operations. Management believes that the existing manufacturing facilities are adequate for its operations and that the facilities are maintained in good condition.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Information regarding the Company's current legal proceedings is presented in Note 8 and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.

Irish Taxes Applicable to Dividends

Irish income tax may arise with respect to dividends paid on Eaton shares. Eaton may be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (“IDWT”, currently at a rate of 25%) from dividends paid to shareholders who are not tax residents of Ireland even though they are not be subject to this tax. To claim exemption from IDWT, shareholders can complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax exemption forms or hold their shares in an account through the Depository Trust Company and have on file with their broker or qualifying agent a valid U.S. address on the record date of the dividend.

Eaton shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability for Irish income tax on the dividends unless they are otherwise subject to Irish income tax.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Eaton Corporation plc

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Eaton Corporation plc’s (“the Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on the COSO criteria.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of entities that were acquired during


(as defined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), which are included in the


consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 5% of total assets (inclusive of acquired intangible assets) as of

December 31, 2019

and less than 1% of net sales for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of entities that were acquired during


.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of

December 31, 2019

and


, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2019

, and the related notes and our report dated

February 26, 2020

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Eaton Corporation plc ("Eaton") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act rules 13a-15(f)).

Under the supervision and with the participation of Eaton's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. Our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of entities that were acquired during 2019 (as defined in Note 2), which are included in the 2019 consolidated financial statements and constituted approximately 5% of total assets (inclusive of acquired intangible assets) as of December 31, 2019 and less than 1% of net sales for the year then ended. In conducting this evaluation, we used the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this evaluation under the framework referred to above, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2019

.

The independent registered public accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. This report is included herein.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General Information and Basis of Presentation

Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton or the Company) is a power management company with


net sales of

$

21.4

billion

. Eaton’s mission is to improve the quality of life and the environment through the use of power management technologies and services. We provide sustainable solutions that help our customers effectively manage electrical, hydraulic and mechanical power – more safely, more efficiently and more reliably. Eaton has approximately

101,000

employees in


countries and sells products to customers in more than


countries.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements were filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eaton and all subsidiaries and other entities it controls. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in associate companies where the Company has significant influence and generally a


%

to


%

ownership interest. Equity investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the book value of the investment exceeds fair value. An impairment would exist if there is an other-than-temporary decline in value. Income from equity investments is reported in Other (income) expense - net. Eaton does not have off-balance sheet arrangements or financings with unconsolidated entities.

Eaton's functional currency is United States Dollars (USD). The functional currency for most subsidiaries is their local currency. Financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates as to assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates as to revenues and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Eaton adopted Accounting Standard Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and related amendments, in the first quarter of 2019 using the optional transition method and has not restated prior periods. The Company elected to use the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed the carry forward of historical lease classification of existing leases. The Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of less than

$


to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. Additionally, the adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of lease assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of

$


and

$


,

respectively,

as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income or Cash Flows.

Eaton adopted Accounting Standard Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, in the first quarter 2019 using the modified retrospective approach for hedge instruments that existed at the date of adoption. ASU 2017-12 is intended to better align the Company's risk management activities with financial reporting for hedging relationships. The standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, expands the ability to hedge specific risk components, and generally requires the change in value of the hedge instrument and hedged item to be presented in the same income statement line. The new disclosure requirements were applied on a prospective basis and comparative information has not been restated. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Eaton adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, in the first quarter of 2020. This standard introduces new guidance for accounting for credit losses on receivables. The Company did not recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020, as the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.



Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized when control of promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. The majority of the Company’s sales agreements contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. In these types of agreements, we generally allocate sales price to each distinct obligation based on the price of each item sold in separate transactions.

Payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and payment is due is not significant. Eaton does not evaluate whether the selling price includes a financing interest component for contracts that are less than a year. Sales, value added, and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue are excluded from sales. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of products sold.

Eaton records reductions to sales for returns, and customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates, at the time of the initial sale. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets Eaton serves, but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels. Returns are estimated at the time of the sale primarily based on historical experience and recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 3 for additional information.

Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets

Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is equivalent to Eaton's operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment, including goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill is assigned to each operating segment, as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results. The Company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis. Additionally, goodwill is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying amount.

The annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a qualitative analysis in


and


, except for the Hydraulics segment which used a quantitative analysis in


. A qualitative analysis is performed by assessing certain trends and factors, including projected market outlook and growth rates, forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins, discount rates, industry data, and other relevant qualitative factors. These trends and factors are compared to, and based on, the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative analysis performed for each reporting unit. The results of the qualitative analyses did not indicate a need to perform quantitative analysis.

Goodwill impairment testing was also performed using quantitative analyses in 2019 as a result of the Lighting business being classified as held for sale as discussed in Note 2, and in 2018 for the Electrical Products, Vehicle and eMobility segments due to a reorganization of the Company’s businesses resulting in the creation of the eMobility segment. The Company used the relative fair value method to reallocate goodwill.

Quantitative analyses were performed by estimating the fair value for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model, which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted-average cost of capital. The forecasted cash flows were based on the Company's long-term operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segment's cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, revenue growth, and margin assumptions of the respective reporting unit. Sensitivity analyses were performed around certain of these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values.

Based on these analyses performed in


and


, the fair value of Eaton's reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts and thus, no impairment exists.



Indefinite life intangible assets consist of certain trademarks. They are evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis to determine whether their fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts. Indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing for


and


was performed using a quantitative analysis. The Company determines the fair value of these assets using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired, but using updated estimates of future sales, cash flows and profitability. Additionally, indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. For


and


, the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying value.

For additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 4.

Leases

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. As most leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, Eaton uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The length of a lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options. The Company made an accounting policy election to not recognize lease assets or liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Additionally, when accounting for leases, the Company combines payments for leased assets, related services and other components of a lease.

Other Long-Lived Assets

Depreciation and amortization for property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are generally computed by the straight-line method and included in Cost of products sold, Selling and administrative expense, and Research and development expense, as appropriate. Cost of buildings are depreciated generally over


years

and machinery and equipment over


to


years

. At

December 31, 2019

, the weighted-average amortization period for intangible assets subject to amortization was


years

for patents and technology;


years

for customer relationships; and


years

for certain trademarks. Software is generally amortized up to a life of


years

.

Other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Upon indications of impairment, assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value. Determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgment.

Retirement Benefits Plans

For the principal pension plans in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, the Company uses a market-related value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit costs. The market-related value of plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period. All other plans use fair value of plan assets.

Net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor. The Company’s corridors are set at either


%

or


%

, depending on the plan, of the greater of the plan assets or benefit obligations. Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over an average employee future service period that differs by plan, but is approximately


years

on a weighted average basis. If most or all of the plan’s participants are no longer actively accruing benefits, the average life expectancy is used.

Asset Retirement Obligations

A conditional asset retirement obligation is recognized at fair value when incurred if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation would be considered in the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. Eaton believes that for substantially all of its asset retirement obligations, there is an indeterminate settlement date because the range of time over which the Company may settle the obligation is unknown or cannot be estimated. A liability for these obligations will be recognized when sufficient information is available to estimate fair value.



Income Taxes

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of the respective assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards. Judgment is required in determining and evaluating income tax provisions and valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets. Eaton recognizes an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Eaton evaluates and adjusts these accruals based on changing facts and circumstances. Eaton recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income tax expense. Eaton's policy is to release income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income when individual units of account are sold, terminated, or extinguished. For additional information about income taxes, see Note 9.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

Eaton uses derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure to the volatility in raw material costs, currency, and interest rates on certain debt. These instruments are marked to fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized depending upon the type of hedging relationship and whether an instrument has been designated as a hedge. For those instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, Eaton designates the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in fair value of these instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in net income. See Note 13 for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instruments.

Note 2.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES

Sale of heavy-duty and medium-duty commercial vehicle automated transmission business

On July 31, 2017, Eaton sold a


%

interest in its heavy-duty and medium-duty commercial vehicle automated transmission business for

$


in cash to Cummins, Inc. The new joint venture is named Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies (ECATT). In 2017, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of

$

1,077

, of which

$


related to the pre-tax gain from the

$


proceeds from the sale and

$


related to the Company’s remaining


%

investment in the joint venture being remeasured to fair value. The after-tax gain was

$


. The fair value is based on the price paid to Eaton for the


%

interest sold to Cummins, Inc. and further supported by a discounted cash flow model. Eaton accounts for its investment on the equity method of accounting.

Acquisition of controlling interest of Ulusoy Elektrik Imalat Taahhut ve Ticaret A.S.

On April 15, 2019, Eaton completed the acquisition of an

82.275

%

controlling interest in Ulusoy Elektrik Imalat Taahhut ve Ticaret A.S. (Ulusoy Elektrik), a leading manufacturer of electrical switchgear based in Ankara, Turkey, with a primary focus on medium voltage solutions for industrial and utility customers. Its sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018 were

$


. The purchase price for the shares was

$


on a cash and debt free basis. As required by the Turkish capital markets legislation, Eaton filed an application to execute a mandatory tender offer for the remaining shares shortly after the transaction closed. During the tender offer, Eaton purchased additional shares for

$


through July 2019 to increase its ownership interest to

93.7

%

. Ulusoy Elektrik is reported within the Electrical Systems and Services business segment.

Acquisition of Innovative Switchgear Solutions, Inc.

On July 19, 2019, Eaton acquired Innovative Switchgear Solutions, Inc. (ISG), a specialty manufacturer of medium-voltage electrical equipment serving the North American utility, commercial and industrial markets. Its 2018 sales were approximately

$


. ISG is reported within the Electrical Systems and Services business segment.

Acquisition of Souriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies

On December 20, 2019, Eaton acquired the Souriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies (Souriau-Sunbank) business of TransDigm Group Inc. for a cash purchase price of

$


, net of cash received. Headquartered in Versailles, France, Souriau-Sunbank is a global leader in highly engineered electrical interconnect solutions for harsh environments in the aerospace, defense, industrial, energy, and transport markets. Its sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019 were

$


. Souriau-Sunbank is reported within the Aerospace business segment.



The acquisition of Souriau-Sunbank has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their respective fair values on the acquisition date.

The table below summarizes the preliminary estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. These preliminary estimates will be revised during the measurement period as third-party valuations are received and finalized, further information becomes available and additional analyses are performed, and these differences could have a material impact on Eaton's preliminary purchase price allocation.

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the anticipated synergies of acquiring Souriau-Sunbank. Goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. Other intangible assets of

$


are expected to include customer relationships, trademarks and technology. Given the timing of the acquisition, Eaton utilized a benchmarking approach based on similar acquisitions to determine the preliminary fair values for intangible assets. See Note 4 for additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets.

The Company incurred

$


of acquisition related transaction costs in 2019 for Souriau-Sunbank that were included in Selling and administrative expense.

Eaton’s Consolidated Financial Statements include Souriau-Sunbank’s results of operations, including sales of

$


, from the date of the acquisition through December 31, 2019.

Sale of Automotive Fluid Conveyance business

On December 31, 2019, Eaton sold its Automotive Fluid Conveyance Business. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax loss of

$


which was recorded in Other expense (income) - net. This business was reported within the Vehicle business segment.

Pending Sale of Lighting business

On October 15, 2019, Eaton entered into an agreement to sell its Lighting business to Signify N.V. for a cash purchase price of

$

1.4

billion

. The Lighting business, which had sales of

$

1.6

billion

in 2019 as part of the Electrical Products business segment, serves customers in commercial, industrial, residential and municipal markets. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company determined the Lighting business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Therefore, its assets and liabilities have been presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

December 31, 2019

. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. There was no write-down as fair value of the Lighting business assets less costs to sell exceeded carrying value. Depreciation and amortization expense is not recorded for the period in which Other long-lived assets are classified as held for sale.

The Company used the relative fair value method to allocate goodwill to the Lighting business. The fair values of the Electrical Products business segment and Lighting business were estimated based on a combination of the price paid to Eaton by Signify N.V. and a discounted cash flow model. The model includes estimates of future cash flows, future growth rates, terminal value amounts, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, revenue growth, and margin assumptions.



The assets and liabilities of the Lighting business classified as held for sale at

December 31, 2019

are as follows:

The Lighting business did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations as the sale does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.

Pending Sale of Hydraulics business

On January 21, 2020, Eaton entered into an agreement to sell its Hydraulics business to Danfoss A/S, a Danish industrial company, for

$

3.3

billion

in cash. Eaton’s Hydraulics business, which accounted for


%

of Eaton’s Hydraulics segment revenue in 2019, is a global leader in hydraulics components, systems, and services for industrial and mobile equipment. The business had sales of

$

2.2

billion

in 2019. Eaton is retaining the Filtration and Golf Grip businesses currently reported in the company’s Hydraulics segment. Eaton expects the Hydraulics business to be classified as held for sale during the first quarter of 2020. The Hydraulics business did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations as the sale does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of 2020.

Acquisition of Power Distribution, Inc.

On February 25, 2020, Eaton completed the acquisition of Power Distribution, Inc. a leading supplier of mission critical power distribution, static switching, and power monitoring equipment and services for data centers and industrial and commercial customers. The company is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, and had 2019 sales of

$


. Power Distribution, Inc. will be reported within the Electrical Systems and Services business segment.



Note 3.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Sales are recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of promised goods or services have transferred to our customers. Sales are measured at the amount of consideration the Company expects to be paid in exchange for these products or services.

The majority of the Company’s sales agreements contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time when title and risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Sales recognized over time are less than


%

of Eaton’s Consolidated Net Sales. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. In these types of agreements, we generally allocate sales price to each distinct obligation based on the price of each item sold in separate transactions.

Due to the nature of the work required to be performed for obligations recognized over time, Eaton estimates total costs by contract. The estimate of total costs are subject to judgment. Estimated amounts are included in the recognized sales price to the extent it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative sales will occur. Additionally, contracts can be modified to account for changes in contract specifications, requirements or sale price. The effect of a contract modification on the sales price or adjustments to the measure of completion under the input method are recognized as adjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis.

Payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Eaton does not evaluate whether the selling price includes a financing interest component for contracts that are less than a year. Sales, value added, and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue are excluded from sales. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of products sold.

Eaton records reductions to sales for returns, and customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates, at the time of the initial sale. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets Eaton serves, but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels. Returns are estimated at the time of the sale primarily based on historical experience and are recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Sales commissions are expensed when the amortization period is less than a year and are generally not capitalized as they are typically earned at the completion of the contract when the customer is invoiced or when the customer pays Eaton.

Sales of products and services varies by segment and are discussed in Note 15.

In the Electrical Products segment, sales contracts are primarily for electrical components, industrial components, residential products, single phase power quality, emergency lighting, fire detection, wiring devices, structural support systems, circuit protection, and lighting products. These sales contracts are primarily based on a customer’s purchase order followed by our order acknowledgement, and may also include a master supply or distributor agreement. In this segment, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer’s facility.

In the Electrical Systems and Services segment, sales contracts are primarily for power distribution and assemblies, three phase power quality, hazardous duty electrical equipment, intrinsically safe explosion-proof instrumentation, utility power distribution, power reliability equipment, and services. The majority of the sales contracts in this segment contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer’s facility; however, certain power distribution and power quality services are recognized over time.

Many of the products and services in power distribution and power quality services meet the definition of continuous transfer of control to customers and are recognized over time. These products are engineered to a customer’s design specifications, have no alternative use to Eaton, and are controlled by the customer as evidenced by the customer’s contractual ownership of the work in process or our right to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable margin. As control is transferring over time, sales are recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the obligation. Eaton generally uses an input method to determine the progress completed and sales are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Incurred cost represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer.



In the Hydraulics segment, sales contracts are primarily for hydraulic components and systems for industrial and mobile equipment. These sales contracts are primarily based on a customer’s purchase order. In this segment, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time when we ship the product from our facility.

In the Aerospace segment, sales contracts are primarily for aerospace fuel, hydraulics, and pneumatic systems for commercial and military use. These sales contracts are primarily based on a customer’s purchase order, and frequently covered by terms and conditions included in a long-term agreement. In this segment, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer’s facility. Our military contracts are primarily fixed-price contracts that are not subject to performance-based payments or progress payments from the customer.

In the Vehicle segment, sales contracts are primarily for drivetrains, powertrain systems and critical components that reduce emissions and improve fuel economy, stability, performance, and safety of cars, light trucks and commercial vehicles. These sales contracts are primarily based on a customer’s purchase order or a blanket purchase order subject to firm releases, frequently covered by terms and conditions included in a master supply agreement. In this segment, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer’s facility.

In the eMobility segment, sales contracts are primarily for electronic and mechanical components and systems that improves the power management and performance of both on-road and off-road vehicles. These sales contracts are primarily based on a customer’s purchase order. In this segment, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer’s facility.

In limited circumstances, primarily in the Electrical and Vehicle segments, Eaton sells separately-priced warranties that extend the warranty coverage beyond the standard coverage offered on specific products. Sales for these separately-priced warranties are recorded based on their stand-alone selling price and are recognized as revenue over the length of the warranty period.

The Company’s

six

operating segments and the following tables disaggregate sales by lines of businesses, geographic destination, market channel or end market.



The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (revenue recognized exceeds amount billed to the customer), and deferred revenue (advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized). Accounts receivables from customers were

$

3,090

and

$

3,402

at

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, respectively. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Unbilled receivables were

$


and

$


at

December 31, 2019

and

December 31, 2018

, respectively, and are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to revenue recognized and not yet billed, partially offset by billings to customers during


.

Changes in the deferred revenue liabilities are as follows:

A significant portion of open orders placed with Eaton are by original equipment manufacturers or distributors. These open orders are not considered firm as they have been historically subject to releases by customers. In measuring backlog of unsatisfied or partially satisfied obligations, only the amount of orders to which customers are firmly committed are included. Using this criterion, total backlog at

December 31, 2019

was approximately

$

5.4

billion

. At

December 31, 2019

, Eaton expects to recognize approximately


%

of this backlog in the next twelve months and the rest thereafter.

LEASES

Eaton leases certain manufacturing facilities, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, vehicles and equipment. Most real estate leases contain renewal options. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion. The Company's lease agreements typically do not contain any significant guarantees of asset values at the end of a lease or restrictive covenants. Payments within certain lease agreements are adjusted periodically for changes in an index or rate.

Retirement Benefits Plans Assumptions

For purposes of determining liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans in the United States, in 2017 the Company used 2014 mortality tables and a generational improvement scale that is based on MP-2017. In 2018 and 2019, for the majority of its plans in the United States, the Company used mortality tables that are based on the Company's own experience and generational improvement scales that are based on MP-2018 and MP-2019, respectively.

To estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for the vast majority of its defined benefits pension and other postretirement benefits plans, the Company used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the relevant projected cash flows.

Pension Plans

The expected long-term rate of return on pension assets was determined for each country and reflects long-term historical data taking into account each plan's target asset allocation. The expected long-term rates of return on pension assets for United States pension plans and Non-United States pension plans for


are

7.25

%

and

5.84

%

, respectively. The discount rates were determined using appropriate bond data for each country.



Other Postretirement Benefits Plans

Substantially all of the obligation for other postretirement benefits plans relates to United States plans.

Assumptions used to determine other postretirement benefits obligations and expense follow:

Assumed health care cost trend rates may have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.

A 1-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

For other postretirement benefits liabilities, the expected subsidy receipts related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 would reduce the gross payments listed below.



Pension Plan Assets

Investment policies and strategies are developed on a country specific basis. The United States plans, representing


%

of worldwide pension assets, and the United Kingdom plans representing


%

of worldwide pension assets, are invested primarily for growth, as the majority of the assets are in plans with active participants and ongoing accruals. In general, the plans have their primary allocation to diversified global equities, primarily through index funds in the form of common collective and other trusts. The United States plans' target allocation is


%

United States equities,


%

non-United States equities,


%

real estate (primarily equity of real estate investment trusts),


%

debt securities and


%

other, including private equity and cash equivalents. The United Kingdom plans' target asset allocations are


%

equities and

the remainder

in debt securities, cash equivalents and real estate investments. The equity risk for the plans is managed through broad geographic diversification and diversification across industries and levels of market capitalization. The majority of debt allocations for these plans are longer duration government and corporate debt. The United States, United Kingdom and Canada pension plans are authorized to use derivatives to achieve more economically desired market exposures and to use futures, swaps and options to gain or hedge exposures.

Fair Value Measurements

Financial instruments included in pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets are categorized into a fair value hierarchy of three levels, based on the degree of subjectivity inherent in the valuation methodology as follows:

Level 1  -

Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets.

Level 2  -

Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3  -

Unobservable prices or inputs.

Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables to permit a reconciliation to total plan assets.

Valuation Methodologies

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at

December 31, 2019

and


.

Common collective and other trusts -

Valued at the net unit value of units held by the trust at year end. The unit value is determined by the total value of fund assets divided by the total number of units of the fund owned. The equity investments in collective trusts are predominantly in index funds for which the underlying securities are actively traded in public markets based upon readily measurable prices. The investments in other trusts are predominantly in exchange traded funds for which the underlying securities are actively traded in public markets based upon readily measurable prices. Common collective and other trusts measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total plan assets.

Fixed income securities -

These securities consist of publicly traded United States and non-United States fixed interest obligations (principally corporate and government bonds and debentures). The fair value of corporate and government debt securities is determined through third-party pricing models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curves, credit ratings, and current market prices. The Company verifies the results of trustees or custodians and evaluates the pricing classification of these securities by performing analyses using other third-party sources.

United States treasuries -

Valued at the closing price of each security.

Bank loans -

These securities consist of senior secured term loans of publicly traded and privately held United States and non-United States floating rate obligations (principally corporations of non-investment grade rating). The fair value is determined through third-party pricing models that primarily utilize dealer quoted current market prices. The Company verifies the results of trustees or custodians and evaluates the pricing classification of these securities by performing analyses using other third-party sources.

Equity securities -

These securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. As such, the direct investments are classified as Level 1.



Real estate -

Consists of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies and investments in pooled funds that invest directly in real estate. The publicly traded companies are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded and as such are classified as Level 1. The pooled funds rely on appraisal based valuations and as such are classified as Level 3.

Cash equivalents -

Primarily certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements.

Exchange traded funds -

Valued at the closing price of the exchange traded fund's shares.

Money market funds

- Money market funds measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total plan assets.

Other -

Primarily insurance contracts for international plans and also futures contracts and over-the-counter options. These investments are valued based on the closing prices of future contracts or indices as available on Bloomberg or similar service, private credit and private equity investments.

For additional information regarding fair value measurements, see Note 12.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company has various defined contribution benefit plans, primarily consisting of the plans in the United States.

The total contributions related to these plans are charged to expense and were as follows:



Note 8.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Contingencies

Eaton is subject to a broad range of claims, administrative and legal proceedings such as lawsuits that relate to contractual allegations, tax audits, patent infringement, personal injuries, antitrust matters, and employment-related matters. Eaton is also subject to asbestos claims from historic products which may have contained asbestos. Insurance may cover some of the costs associated with these claims and proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome or cost of these matters, the Company believes they will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2011, Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc. (“Pepsi”) filed an action against (a) Cooper Industries, LLC, Cooper Industries, Ltd., Cooper Holdings, Ltd., Cooper US, Inc., and Cooper Industries plc (collectively, “Cooper”), (b) M&F Worldwide Corp., Mafco Worldwide Corp., Mafco Consolidated Group LLC, and PCT International Holdings, Inc. (collectively, “Mafco”), and (c) the Pneumo Abex Asbestos Claims Settlement Trust (the “Trust”) in Texas state court. Pepsi alleged that it was harmed by a 2011 settlement agreement (“2011 Settlement”) among Cooper, Mafco, and Pneumo Abex, LLC (“Pneumo,” which prior to the 2011 Settlement was a Mafco subsidiary), which settlement resolved litigation that Pneumo had previously brought against Cooper involving, among other things, a guaranty related to Pneumo’s friction products business. In November 2015, after a Texas court ruled that Pepsi's claims should be heard in arbitration, Pepsi filed a demand for arbitration against Cooper, Mafco, the Trust, and Pneumo. Pepsi subsequently dropped claims against all parties except Cooper. An arbitration under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association commenced in October 2017. Pepsi’s experts opined, among other things, that the value contributed to the Trust for a release of the guaranty was below reasonably equivalent value, and that an inability of Pneumo to satisfy future liabilities could result in plaintiffs suing Pepsi under various theories. Cooper submitted various expert reports and, among other things, Cooper’s experts opined that Pepsi had no basis to seek any damages and that Cooper paid reasonably equivalent value for the release of its indemnity obligations under the guaranty. The arbitration proceedings closed in December 2017. On July 11, 2018, the arbitration panel made certain findings and concluded that the value contributed to the Trust did not constitute reasonably equivalent value, but ordered the parties to recalculate the amount that should have been contributed to the Trust as of the date of the 2011 transaction. Based on the findings made by the panel and the recalculation ordered by the panel, Cooper believed that no additional amount should be contributed. Pepsi argued that an additional

$


should be contributed. Cooper and its expert disagreed with Pepsi’s argument and believed that Pepsi’s recalculation was flawed and failed to comply with the instructions of the panel. On August 23, 2018, the panel issued its final award and ordered Cooper to pay

$


to Pneumo Abex. On August 30, 2018, Pepsi sought to confirm the award in Texas state court, which Cooper opposed on October 9, 2018. Cooper further requested that the court vacate the award on various grounds, including that Cooper was prejudiced by the conduct of the proceedings, the panel exceeded its powers, and because the panel denied Cooper a full and fair opportunity to present certain evidence. The court confirmed the award at the confirmation hearing, which was held on October 12, 2018. On November 2, 2018, the Company appealed. On November 28, 2018, the Company paid

$


, the full judgment plus accrued post-judgment interest, to Pneumo Abex and preserved its rights, including to appeal. On April 25, 2019, the appeal that Cooper filed was dismissed.

Environmental Contingencies

Eaton has established policies to ensure that its operations are conducted in keeping with good corporate citizenship and with a positive commitment to the protection of the natural and workplace environments. The Company's manufacturing facilities are required to be certified to ISO 14001, an international standard for environmental management systems. The Company routinely reviews EHS performance at each of its facilities and continuously strives to improve pollution prevention.

Eaton is involved in remedial response and voluntary environmental remediation at a number of sites, including certain of its currently-owned or formerly-owned plants. The Company has also been named a potentially responsible party under the United States federal Superfund law, or the state equivalents thereof, at a number of disposal sites. The Company became involved in these sites as a result of government action or in connection with business acquisitions. At the end of


, the Company was involved with a total of


sites worldwide, including the Superfund sites mentioned above, with

none

of these sites being individually significant to the Company.



Remediation activities, generally involving soil and/or groundwater contamination, include pre-cleanup activities such as fact finding and investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study, design and action planning, performance (where actions may range from monitoring, to removal of contaminants, to installation of longer-term remediation systems), and operation and maintenance of a remediation system. The extent of expected remediation activities and costs varies by site. A number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation, including the number of parties involved at a particular site, the determination of the extent of contamination, the length of time the remediation may require, the complexity of environmental regulations, and the continuing advancement of remediation technology. Taking these factors into account, Eaton has estimated the costs of remediation, which will be paid over a period of years. The Company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis, consistent with the estimates of these costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred. Actual results may differ from these estimates. At

December 31, 2019

and


, the Company had an accrual totaling

$


and

$


, respectively, for these costs.

Based upon Eaton's analysis and subject to the difficulty in estimating these future costs, the Company expects that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters is not reasonably possible to exceed the recorded liability by an amount that would have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Warranty Accruals

Product warranty accruals are established at the time the related sale is recognized through a charge to Cost of products sold. Warranty accrual estimates are based primarily on historical warranty claim experience and specific customer contracts. Provisions for warranty accruals are comprised of basic warranties for products sold, as well as accruals for product recalls and other events when they are known and estimable.

A summary of the current and long-term warranty accruals follows:

INCOME TAXES

Eaton Corporation plc is domiciled in Ireland.

Income (loss) before income taxes and income tax (benefit) expense are summarized below based on the geographic location of the operation to which such earnings and income taxes are attributable.

Reconciliations of income taxes from the Ireland national statutory rate of 25% to the consolidated effective income tax rate follow:



During


, income tax expense of

$


was recognized (an effective tax rate of

14.6

%

) compared to income tax expense of

$


in


(an effective tax rate of

11.5

%

) and income tax expense of

$


in


(an effective tax rate of

11.3

%

). The


effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of

$


on the arbitration decision expense discussed in Note 8. The


effective tax rate includes tax expense of

$


on the gain related to the sale of a business discussed in Note 2 and a tax benefit of

$


related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) which is discussed in further detail below. Excluding the impacts of the 2018 arbitration decision, the 2017 sale of business, and the 2017 TCJA, the effective tax rate was

12.8

%

in 2018 and

9.2

%

in 2017. The increase in the tax rate from

12.8

%

in


to

14.6

%

in


was primarily due to greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions. The increase from

9.2

%

in


compared to

12.8

%

in


was due to greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions and an increase in tax contingencies offset by net decreases of related valuation allowances.

The TCJA was enacted on December 22, 2017, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and required a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries owned directly or indirectly by U.S. subsidiaries of the Company. In December 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax benefit amount of

$


for the impact of the tax rate change on deferred tax balances and a provisional tax expense of

$


for the one-time transition tax, for a net tax benefit of

$


. During 2018, the Company finalized its accounting for the 2017 enactment of the TCJA and recorded an adjustment of

$


tax expense, primarily related to the one-time transition tax, resulting in a final net tax benefit of

$


.

No provision has been made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately

$

28.5

billion

at

December 31, 2019

, since it is the Company's intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company expects to deploy capital to those markets which offer particularly attractive growth opportunities. The cash that is permanently reinvested is typically used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable withholding taxes that would be payable on the remittance of such undistributed earnings.

Worldwide income tax payments, net of tax refunds, follow:

Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities

Components of noncurrent deferred income taxes follow:



At

December 31, 2019

, Eaton Corporation plc and certain Irish subsidiaries had tax loss carryforwards that are available to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities.

These carryforwards and their respective expiration dates are summarized below:

At

December 31, 2019

, the Company's foreign subsidiaries had income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce future taxable income or tax liabilities.

These carryforwards and their respective expiration dates are summarized below:

Recoverability of Deferred Income Tax Assets

Eaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In order to determine its income tax provision for financial statement purposes, Eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions. These estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards.

Management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. If the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax income in a particular jurisdiction in the three-year period including the current and prior two years, management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized, unless known or planned operating developments, or changes in tax laws, would lead management to conclude otherwise. However, if the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the three-year period including the current and prior two years, management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized. These factors include historical operating results, known or planned operating developments, the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse, consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities, tax law carryback capability in the particular country, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, changes in tax laws, and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as those used for the Company's goodwill and other impairment testing. After evaluation of these factors, if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country, management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required. To the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction, management would establish a valuation allowance.

Applying the above methodology, valuation allowances have been established for certain deferred income tax assets to the extent they are not expected to be realized within the particular tax carryforward period.



Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits

A summary of gross unrecognized income tax benefits follows:

Eaton recognizes an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the benefit would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company evaluates and adjusts the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits based on changes in facts and circumstances. The Company does not enter into any of the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Listed Transactions as set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.6011-4.

If all unrecognized income tax benefits were recognized, the net impact on the provision for income tax expense would be

$


, which includes the impact of deferred tax netting pursuant to ASU 2013-11.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, Eaton had accrued approximately

$


and

$


, respectively, for the payment of worldwide interest and penalties, which are not included in the table of unrecognized income tax benefits above. Eaton recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income tax expense.

The resolution of the majority of Eaton's unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as the prospect of retroactive regulations; new case law; and the willingness of the income tax authority to settle the issue, including the timing thereof. Therefore, for the majority of unrecognized income tax benefits, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the next 12 months. For each of the unrecognized income tax benefits where it is possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the balance within the next 12 months, the Company does not anticipate any significant change.

Eaton or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in Ireland and many countries around the world. With only a few exceptions, Irish and non-United States subsidiaries of Eaton are no longer subject to examinations for years before 2012.

The United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examination of the consolidated income tax returns of the Company’s United States subsidiaries (“Eaton US”) for 2005 through 2010 and has issued Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) as discussed below. The statute of limitations on these tax years remains open until the matters are resolved. The IRS has also completed its examination of the consolidated income tax returns of Eaton US for 2011 through 2013 and has issued proposed adjustments as discussed below. The statute of limitations on these tax years remains open until June 30, 2021. The IRS is currently examining tax years 2014 through 2016. The statute of limitations for tax years 2014 through 2016 is open until May 31, 2021. Tax years 2017 and 2018 are still subject to examination by the IRS.

Eaton US is also under examination for the income tax filings in various states and localities of the United States. Income tax returns of states and localities within the United States will be reopened to the extent of United States federal income tax adjustments, if any, going back to 2005 when those audit years are finalized. Some states and localities might not limit their assessment to the United States federal adjustments, and may require the opening of the entire tax year.



In 2011, the IRS issued a Notice for Eaton US for the 2005 and 2006 tax years (the 2011 Notice). The 2011 Notice proposed assessments of

$


in additional taxes plus

$


in penalties related primarily to transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in the Company's facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the United States. Eaton US has set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates at the same prices that Eaton US sells such products to third parties as required by two successive Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) Eaton US entered into with the IRS that governed the 2005-2010 tax years. Eaton US has continued to apply the arms-length transfer pricing methodology for 2011 through the current reporting period. Immediately prior to the 2011 Notice being issued, the IRS sent a letter stating that it was retrospectively canceling the APAs. Eaton US contested the proposed assessments in United States Tax Court. The case involved both whether the APAs should be enforced and, if not, the appropriate transfer pricing methodology. On July 26, 2017, the United States Tax Court issued a ruling in which it agreed with Eaton US that the IRS must abide by the terms of the APAs for the tax years 2005-2006. The Tax Court’s ruling on the APAs did not have a material impact on Eaton’s consolidated financial statements.

In 2014, Eaton US received a Notice from the IRS for the 2007 through 2010 tax years (the 2014 Notice) proposing assessments of

$


in additional taxes plus

$


in penalties, net of agreed credits and deductions, which the Company has also contested in Tax Court. The proposed assessments pertain primarily to the same transfer pricing issues and APA for which the Tax Court has issued its ruling during 2017 as noted above. The Company believes that the Tax Court’s ruling for tax years 2005-2006 will also be applicable to the 2007-2010 years. Following the issuance of the Tax Court’s ruling, Eaton and the IRS recognized that the ruling on the enforceability of the APAs did not address a secondary issue regarding the transfer pricing for a certain royalty paid from 2006-2010. Eaton US reported a consistent royalty rate for 2006-2010. The IRS has agreed to the royalty rate as reported by Eaton US in 2006. Although the IRS has not proposed an alternative rate, it has not agreed to apply the same royalty rate in the 2007-2010 years.

The 2014 Notice also includes a separate proposed assessment involving the recognition of income for several of Eaton US’s controlled foreign corporations. The Company believes that the proposed assessment is without merit and is contesting the matter in Tax Court. In October 2017, Eaton and the IRS both moved for partial summary judgment on this issue. On February 25, 2019 the Tax Court granted the IRS’s motion for partial summary judgment and denied Eaton’s. The Company intends to appeal the Tax Court’s partial summary judgment decision to the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Company believes that it will be successful on appeal and has not recorded any additional impact of the Tax Court's decision in its consolidated financial statements. The total potential impact of the Tax Court's partial summary judgment decision on the controlled foreign corporation income recognition issue is not estimable until all matters in the open tax years have been resolved.

In 2018 the IRS completed its examination of the Eaton US tax years 2011 through 2013 and has proposed adjustments to certain transfer pricing tax positions, including adjustments similar to those proposed in the 2011 and 2014 Notices for products manufactured in the Company’s facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the United States. The IRS also proposed adjustments involving the recognition of income for several of Eaton US’s controlled foreign corporation, which is the same issue included in the 2014 Notice described above and subject to litigation in Tax Court. The Company intends to pursue its administrative appeals alternatives with respect to each of the IRS adjustments and believes that final resolution of the proposed adjustments will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

During 2010, the Company received a tax assessment, which included interest and penalties, in Brazil for the tax years 2005 through 2008 that relates to the amortization of certain goodwill generated from the acquisition of third-party businesses and corporate reorganizations. In 2018 the Company received an unfavorable result at the final tax administrative appeals level, resulting in an alleged tax deficiency of

$


plus

$


of interest and penalties (translated at the December 31, 2019 exchange rate). The Company is challenging the assessment in the judicial system. During 2014, the Company received a tax assessment, which included interest and penalties, for the 2009 through 2012 tax years (primarily relating to the same issues concerning the 2005 through 2008 tax years). In November 2019, the Company received an unfavorable result at the final tax administrative appeals level, resulting in an alleged tax deficiency of

$


plus

$


of interest and penalties (translated at the December 31, 2019 exchange rate). The Company plans to challenge the assessment in the judicial system. Challenges in the judicial system are expected to take up to


years

to resolve. The Company continues to believe that final resolution of both of the assessments will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 11.

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

Eaton recognizes equity-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award. Awards with service conditions or both service and market conditions are expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Awards with both service and performance conditions are expensed over the period an employee is required to provide service based on the number of units for which achievement of the performance objective is probable. The Company estimates forfeitures as part of recording equity-based compensation expense.

Restricted Stock Units and Awards

Restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock awards (RSAs) have been issued to certain employees and directors. The fair value of RSUs awarded in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and RSAs are determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of grant. The RSUs entitle the holder to receive one ordinary share for each RSU upon vesting, generally over three years. RSAs are issued and outstanding at the time of grant, but remain subject to forfeiture until vested, generally over three or four years.

Performance Share Units

In February


,


and


, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors approved the grant of performance share units (PSUs) to certain employees that vest based on the satisfaction of a three-year service period and total shareholder return relative to that of a group of peers. Awards earned at the end of the three-year vesting period range from


%

to


%

of the targeted number of PSUs granted based on the ranking of total shareholder return of the Company, assuming reinvestment of all dividends, relative to a defined peer group of companies. Equity-based compensation expense for these PSUs is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Upon vesting, dividends that have accumulated during the vesting period are paid on earned awards.

The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of PSUs with market conditions. The principal assumptions utilized in valuing these PSUs include the expected stock price volatility (based on the most recent 3-year period as of the grant date) and the risk-free interest rate (an estimate based on the yield of United States Treasury zero coupon bonds with a 3-year maturity as of the grant date).

A summary of the assumptions used in determining fair value of these PSUs follows:

In February 2016, performance share units were granted to certain employees that entitles the holder to receive one ordinary share for each PSU that vest based on the satisfaction of a three-year service period and the achievement of certain performance metrics over that same period. Upon vesting, PSU holders receive dividends that accumulate during the vesting period. The fair value of these PSUs is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's ordinary shares at the date of grant. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized over the period an employee is required to provide service based on the number of PSUs for which achievement of the performance objectives is probable.

Stock Options

Under various plans, stock options have been granted to certain employees and directors to purchase ordinary shares at prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Substantially all of these options vest ratably during the

three

-year period following the date of grant and expire


years

from the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized for stock options based on the fair value of the options at the date of grant and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period the employee or director is required to provide service.



The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The principal assumptions utilized in valuing stock options include the expected stock price volatility (based on the most recent historical period equal to the expected life of the option); the expected option life (an estimate based on historical experience); the expected dividend yield; and the risk-free interest rate (an estimate based on the yield of United States Treasury zero coupon with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option).

Note 12.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is measured based on an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to satisfy a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a fair value hierarchy is established, which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

A summary of financial instruments recognized at fair value, and the fair value measurements used, follows:

Eaton values its financial instruments using an industry standard market approach, in which prices and other relevant information is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. No financial instruments were measured using unobservable inputs.

Other Fair Value Measurements

Long-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt had a carrying value of

$

8,067

and fair value of

$

8,638

at

December 31, 2019

compared to

$

7,107

and

$

7,061

, respectively, at

December 31, 2018

. The fair value of Eaton's debt instruments was estimated using prevailing market interest rates on debt with similar creditworthiness, terms and maturities and is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement.

As discussed in Note 2, on July 31, 2017 Eaton sold a


%

interest in its heavy-duty and medium-duty commercial vehicle automated transmission business to Cummins, Inc. Eaton's remaining


%

interest was remeasured to a fair value of

$


on July 31, 2017 using a discounted cash flow model which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. The model includes estimates of future cash flows, future growth rates, terminal value amounts, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. Eaton accounts for its investment on the equity method of accounting.

Short-Term Investments

Eaton invests excess cash generated from operations in short-term marketable investments.

A summary of the carrying value, which approximates the fair value due to the short-term maturities of these investments, follows:



Note 13.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

In the normal course of business, Eaton is exposed to certain risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company uses various derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, currency forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and, commodity contracts to manage risks from these market fluctuations. The instruments used by Eaton are straightforward, non-leveraged instruments. The counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings. Eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions. Such instruments are not purchased and sold for trading purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated, and is effective, as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, as to the nature of the hedging activity. Eaton formally documents all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges and the hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative financial instruments to a recognized asset or liability, specific firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or net investment in a foreign operation. These financial instruments can be designated as:

•

Hedges of the change in the fair value of a recognized fixed-rate asset or liability, or the firm commitment to acquire such an asset or liability (a fair value hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in income during the period of change in fair value.

•

Hedges of the variable cash flows of a recognized variable-rate asset or liability, or the forecasted acquisition of such an asset or liability (a cash flow hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss on the hedged item is included in income.

•

Hedges of the currency exposure related to a net investment in a foreign operation (a net investment hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss related to the net investment in the foreign operation is included in income.

The gain or loss from a derivative financial instrument designated as a hedge is classified in the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Income as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. The cash flows resulting from these financial instruments are classified in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

For derivatives that are not designated as a hedge, any gain or loss is immediately recognized in income. The majority of derivatives used in this manner relate to risks resulting from assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and certain commodity contracts that arise in the normal course of business.

Eaton uses certain of its debt denominated in foreign currency to hedge portions of its net investments in foreign operations against foreign currency exposure (net investment hedges). Foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative net investment hedging instruments had a carrying value on an after-tax basis of

$

1,845

and on a pre-tax basis of

$


at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. See Note 6 for additional information about debt.

Interest Rate Risk

Eaton has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk of certain long-term debt. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges of certain long-term debt. The maturity of the swap corresponds with the maturity of the debt instrument as noted in the table of long-term debt in Note 6. Eaton also entered into several forward starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on a future anticipated debt issuance.



A summary of interest rate swaps outstanding at

December 31, 2019

, follows:

Fixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps

Derivative Financial Statement Impacts

The fair value of derivative financial instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets follows:

The currency exchange contracts shown in the table above as derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily contracts entered into to manage currency volatility or exposure on intercompany receivables, payables and loans. While Eaton does not elect hedge accounting treatment for these derivatives, Eaton targets managing


%

of the intercompany balance sheet exposure to minimize the effect of currency volatility related to the movement of goods and services in the normal course of its operations. This activity represents the great majority of these currency exchange contracts. For the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


,

$


of cash inflow and

$


of cash outflow, respectively, resulting from the settlement of these derivatives have been classified in investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The net cash flow from the settlement of these derivatives has been presented in operating activities in 2017 and have not been restated as such amounts are not material.

As of

December 31, 2019

in 2019. Eaton is retaining the Filtration and Golf Grip businesses currently reported in the company’s Hydraulics segment. Eaton expects the Hydraulics business to be classified as held for sale during the first quarter of 2020. The Hydraulics business did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations as the sale does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of 2020.

On February 25, 2020, Eaton completed the acquisition of Power Distribution, Inc. a leading supplier of mission critical power distribution, static switching, and power monitoring equipment and services for data centers and industrial and commercial customers. The company is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, and had 2019 sales of

$125

. Power Distribution, Inc. will be reported within the Electrical Systems and Services business segment.



During


, the Company's results of operations delivered strong sales growth as major global end markets expanded.

As discussed in Note 8, certain Eaton subsidiaries acquired in the 2012 acquisition of Cooper Industries have been ordered to pay $293 by an arbitration panel. The panel’s award, issued on August 23, 2018, relate to claims brought by Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc. (“Pepsi”) in 2011. A Texas state court confirmed the arbitration award at the confirmation hearing, which was held on October 12, 2018. On November 2, 2018, the Company appealed. On November 28, 2018, the Company paid the full judgment plus accrued post-judgment interest to Pneumo Abex and preserved its rights, including to pursue the appeal, which is pending. The impact of the arbitration award was an after-tax expense of $206 in the third quarter of 2018, reducing earnings per share by $0.48.

During


, the Company's results of operations returned to solid growth as global end markets expanded, particularly in the second half of


. During the year, the Company completed its multi-year restructuring program, reducing its cost structure and expanding operating margins.

On July 31, 2017, Eaton sold a

50%

interest in its heavy-duty and medium-duty commercial vehicle automated transmission business for

$600

in cash to Cummins, Inc. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of

$1,077

, of which

$533

related to the pre-tax gain from the

$600

proceeds from the sale and

$544

related to the Company’s remaining 50% investment in the joint venture being remeasured to fair value. The after-tax gain was

$843

. Eaton accounts for its investment on the equity method of accounting.

The tax rate for


includes a tax benefit of $62 related to the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The tax benefit of $62 related to the TCJA is comprised of a tax benefit of $79 for adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities, offset by a tax expense of $17 for the taxation of unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries owned directly or indirectly by U.S. subsidiaries of Eaton.

Additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, and the arbitration decision expense, is presented in Note 2 and Note 8, respectively, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

A summary of Eaton’s Net sales, Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders, and Net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders - diluted follows:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following discussion of Consolidated Financial Results and Business Segment Results of Operations includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per ordinary share, and operating profit before acquisition integration and divestiture charges for each business segment as well as corporate, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the table below. Operating profit before acquisition integration and divestiture charges is reconciled in the discussion of the operating results of each business segment, and excludes acquisition integration and divestiture expense related primarily to the planned divestiture of the Lighting business and the acquisitions of Ulusoy Elektrik, ISG and Souriau-Sunbank discussed in Note 2. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they exclude certain transactions, allowing investors to more easily compare Eaton’s financial performance period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton and each business segment.



Acquisition Integration and Divestiture Charges

Eaton incurs integration charges and transaction costs to acquire businesses, and transaction and other charges to divest and exit businesses. A summary of these charges follows:

Business segment charges in


related to the planned divestiture of the Lighting business and the acquisitions of Ulusoy Elektrik, ISG and Souriau-Sunbank, and were included in Cost of products sold, Selling and administrative expense or Research and development expense. Business segment acquisition integration charges in


related to the integration of Ephesus Lighting, Inc. (Ephesus), which was acquired in 2015. The charges associated with Ephesus were included in Selling and administrative expense. In Business Segment Information in Note 15, the charges reduced Operating profit of the related business segment.

Corporate charges in


are primarily related to the planned divestiture of the Lighting business, the loss on the sale of the Automotive Fluid Conveyance business, and other charges to exit businesses, and were included in Selling and administrative expense and Other (income) expense-net. In Business Segment Information in Note 15, the charges were included in Other corporate expense - net.

Consolidated Financial Results

Net Sales

Net sales in


decreased by

1%

compared to


due to a decrease of 1% from the impact of negative currency translation. Net sales in


increased by

6%

compared to


due to an increase of 6% in organic sales. The increase in organic sales in


was primarily due to higher sales volumes in all business segments.



Gross Profit

Gross profit margin increased from

32.8%

in


to

33.0%

in


. The increase in gross profit margin in


was primarily due to higher sales volumes and other operating improvements in Electrical Products and Electrical Systems and Services business segments, and higher sales volumes and favorable product mix in the Aerospace business segment, partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Hydraulics and Vehicle business segments and the charge for the expected warranty costs in the Vehicle business segment to correct the performance of a product which incorporated a defective part from a supplier. Gross profit increased from

32.6%

in


to

32.8%

in


. The increase in gross profit margin in


was primarily due to higher sales volumes, savings from restructuring actions, and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by commodity inflation and increased freight costs.

Income Taxes

During


, income tax expense of

$378

was recognized (an effective tax rate of

14.6%

) compared to income tax expense of

$278

in


(an effective tax rate of

11.5%

) and income tax expense of

$382

in


(an effective tax rate of

11.3%

). The


effective tax rate includes a tax benefit of

$69

on the arbitration decision expense discussed in Note 8. The


effective tax rate includes tax expense of

$234

on the gain related to the sale of business discussed in Note 2 and a tax benefit of

$62

related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Excluding the impacts of the 2018 arbitration decision, the 2017 sale of business, and the 2017 TCJA, the effective tax rate was

12.8%

in 2018 and

9.2%

in 2017. The increase in the tax rate from 12.8% in 2018 to 14.6% in


was primarily due to greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions. The increase from

9.2%

in 2017 compared to

12.8%

in 2018 was due to greater levels of income in higher tax jurisdictions and an increase in tax contingencies offset by net decreases of related valuation allowances.

Net Income

Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders of

$2,211

in


increased

3%

compared to

$2,145

in


. Net income in


included after-tax expense of $206 from the arbitration decision discussed in Note 8.

Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders of

$2,145

in


decreased

28%

compared to

$2,985

in


. Net income in


included

$843

from the after-tax gain on the sale of the business discussed in Note 2 and

$62

of income from the new U.S. tax bill discussed in Note 9. Excluding these items and the 2018 arbitration decision, the increase in


net income was primarily due to higher sales volumes, savings from restructuring actions, and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by commodity inflation and increased freight costs.

Net income per ordinary share increased to

$5.25

in


compared to

$4.91

in


. Net income per ordinary share in


included an unfavorable $0.48 from the arbitration decision expense discussed in Note 8. Excluding the arbitration decision, the decrease in net income per ordinary share was primarily due to lower Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders, partially offset by the Company's share repurchases over the past year. Net income per ordinary share decreased to

$4.91

in


compared to

$6.68

in


.  Net income per ordinary share in


included $1.89 from the gain on the sale of business discussed in Note 2 and $0.14 income from the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act discussed in Note 9. Excluding these items and the 2018 arbitration decision, Net income per ordinary share increased in


due to higher Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders and the Company's share repurchases over the past year.

Adjusted Earnings

Adjusted earnings of

$2,385

in


increased

11%

compared to Adjusted earnings of

$2,145

in


. The increase in Adjusted earnings in


was primarily due to higher Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders excluding higher acquisition integration and divestiture charges. There were no acquisition integration charges in


and

$2

in


after-tax, which resulted in the same percent change for both Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders and Adjusted earnings from 2017 to


.

Adjusted earnings per ordinary share increased to

$5.67

in


compared to

$4.91

in


. The increase in Adjusted earnings per ordinary share in


was due to higher Adjusted earnings and the impact of the Company's share repurchases over the past year. There was no impact of excluding the acquisition integration and divestiture charges per share from Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders to arrive at Adjusted earnings per ordinary share for


and


.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition and Liquidity

Eaton’s objective is to finance its business through operating cash flow and an appropriate mix of equity and long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying its debt maturity structure, Eaton reduces liquidity risk. The Company maintains access to the commercial paper markets through a

$2,000

commercial paper program. The Company maintains long-term revolving credit facilities totaling

$2,000

, consisting of a

$750

five

-year revolving credit facility that will expire November 17, 2022, a

$500

four

-year revolving credit facility that will expire November 7, 2023, and a

$750

five

-year revolving credit facility that will expire November 7, 2024. The revolving credit facilities are used to support commercial paper borrowings and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis. There were no borrowings outstanding under Eaton's revolving credit facilities at

December 31, 2019

or


. The Company had available lines of credit of

$1,027

from various banks primarily for the issuance of letters of credit, of which there was

$263

outstanding at

December 31, 2019

. Over the course of a year, cash, short-term investments and short-term debt may fluctuate in order to manage global liquidity. Eaton believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, cash and short-term investment balances, and access to capital markets in excess of the liquidity necessary to meet future operating needs of the business as well as scheduled payments of long-term debt.

On May 14, 2019, a subsidiary of Eaton issued euro denominated notes (2019 Euro Notes) with a face value of

€1,100

(

$1,232

based on the May 14, 2019 spot rate), in accordance with Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2019 Euro Notes are comprised of two tranches of

€600

and

€500

, which mature in 2021 and 2025, respectively, with interest payable annually at a respective rate of

0.02%

and

0.70%

. The issuer received proceeds totaling

€1,097

(

$1,229

based on the May 14, 2019 spot rate) from the issuance, net of financing costs and discounts.

For additional information on financing transactions and debt, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Eaton’s credit facilities and indentures governing certain long-term debt contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit facilities for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. At Eaton’s present credit rating level, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of secured debt (or lease payments due under a sale and leaseback transaction) to adjusted consolidated net worth (or consolidated net tangible assets, in each case as defined in the relevant credit agreement or indenture) may not exceed 10%. Eaton's actual ratios are substantially below the required threshold. In addition, Eaton is in compliance with each of its debt covenants for all periods presented.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Credit Ratings

Eaton's debt has been assigned the following credit ratings:

Defined Benefits Plans

Pension Plans

During


, the fair value of plan assets in the Company’s employee pension plans increased

$708

to

$5,336

at

December 31, 2019

. The increase in plan assets was primarily due to higher than expected return on plan assets. At

December 31, 2019

, the net unfunded position of

$1,439

in pension liabilities consisted of $407 in the U.S. qualified pension plan, $1,006 in plans that have no minimum funding requirements, and $99 in all other plans that require minimum funding, partially offset by $73 in plans that are overfunded.

Funding requirements are a major consideration in making contributions to Eaton’s pension plans. With respect to the Company’s pension plans worldwide, the Company intends to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable law and regulations. In


,

$119

was contributed to the pension plans. The Company anticipates making $128 of contributions to certain pension plans during


. The funded status of the Company’s pension plans at the end of


, and future contributions, will depend primarily on the actual return on assets during the year and the discount rate used to calculate certain benefits at the end of the year.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Eaton does not have off-balance sheet arrangements or financings with unconsolidated entities or other persons. The Company made an accounting policy election to not recognize lease assets or liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may involve the exercise of significant judgment. For any estimate or assumption used, there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that could have been used. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other such estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized when control of promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. The majority of the Company’s sales agreements contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. In these types of agreements, we generally allocate sales price to each distinct obligation based on the price of each item sold in separate transactions.



Due to the nature of the work required to be performed for obligations recognized over time, Eaton estimates total costs by contract. The estimate of total costs are subject to judgment. Estimated amounts are included in the recognized sales price to the extent it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative sales will occur. Additionally, contracts can be modified to account for changes in contract specifications, requirements or sale price. The effect of a contract modification on the sales price or adjustments to the measure of completion under the input method are recognized as adjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis.

Eaton records reductions to sales for returns, and customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates, at the time of the initial sale. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets Eaton serves, but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels. Returns are estimated at the time of the sale primarily based on historical experience and recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 3 for additional information.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is equivalent to Eaton's operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment, including goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill is assigned to each operating segment, as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results. The Company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis.

Additionally, goodwill is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events, specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price.

The annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a qualitative analysis in


and


, except for the Hydraulics segment which used a quantitative analysis in


. A qualitative analysis is performed by assessing certain trends and factors, including projected market outlook and growth rates, forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins, discount rates, industry data, and other relevant qualitative factors. These trends and factors are compared to, and based on, the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative analysis performed for each reporting unit. The results of the qualitative analyses did not indicate a need to perform quantitative analysis.

Goodwill impairment testing was also performed using quantitative analyses in 2019 as a result of the Lighting business being classified as held for sale as discussed in Note 2, and in 2018 for the Electrical Products, Vehicle and eMobility segments due to a reorganization of the Company’s businesses resulting in the creation of the eMobility segment. The Company used the relative fair value method to reallocate goodwill.

Quantitative analyses were performed by estimating the fair value for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model, which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted-average cost of capital. The forecasted cash flows were based on the Company's long-term operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segment's cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, revenue growth, and margin assumptions of the respective reporting unit. Sensitivity analyses were performed around certain of these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values.

Based on these analyses performed in


and


, the fair value of Eaton's reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts and thus, no impairment exists.

Indefinite Life Intangible Assets

Indefinite life intangible assets consist of certain trademarks. They are evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis to determine whether their fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts. Indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing for


and


was performed using a quantitative analysis. Determining the fair value of these assets requires significant judgment and the Company uses a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired, but using updated estimates of future sales, cash flows and profitability.



Additionally, indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include changes in industry and market considerations, cost factors, financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events that could affect inputs used to determine the respective fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets.

For


and


, the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying value.

Other Long-Lived Assets

Other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include operations reporting losses, a significant adverse change in the use of an asset, the planned disposal or sale of the asset, a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors related to the asset, or a significant decrease in the estimated market value of an asset. Upon indications of impairment, assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value. In instances where the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded the undiscounted cash flows, the fair value of the asset group would be determined and an impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgment.

Divestitures of Businesses

The Company records assets and liabilities of a business to be sold as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when all the required criteria are met. The held for sale assets and liabilities are initially measured at the lesser of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, with any resulting loss being immediately recognized. In each subsequent reporting period until the business is sold, the Company continues to estimate the fair value less cost to sell of the business and recognizes any additional losses, or any gains to the extent losses were previously recorded on the held for sale assets and liabilities.

The Company used the relative fair value method to allocate goodwill to the Lighting business. The fair values of the Electrical Products segment and Lighting business were estimated based on a combination of the price paid to Eaton by Signify N.V. and a discounted cash flow model. The model includes estimates of future cash flows, future growth rates, terminal value amounts, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, revenue growth, and margin assumptions. For additional information about the divestitures of businesses, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recoverability of Deferred Income Tax Assets

Eaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In order to determine the income tax provision for financial statement purposes, Eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions. These estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards.

Management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which it operates. If the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax income in a particular jurisdiction in a three-year period including the current and prior two years, management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized, unless known or planned operating developments, or changes in tax laws, would lead management to conclude otherwise. However, if the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax losses in a particular jurisdiction in a three-year period including the current and prior two years, management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized. These factors include historical operating results, known or planned operating developments, the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse, consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities, tax law carryback capability in a particular country, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, changes in tax laws, and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as those used for the Company’s goodwill and other impairment testing. After evaluation of these factors, if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country, management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required. To the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction, management would establish a valuation allowance. For additional information about income taxes, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits

Eaton recognizes an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the benefit would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company evaluates and adjusts the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits based on changes in law, facts and circumstances. Eaton also estimates, where reasonably possible, the increase or decrease in the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits in the next 12 months.

The evaluation and determination of the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions is complex and involves both the exercise of judgement and the utilization of certain estimates and assumptions. Each tax position carries unique facts and circumstances that must be evaluated in light of current tax laws, regulations, and judicial decisions. Additionally, the ultimate resolution of the majority of Eaton’s unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as the prospect of retroactive regulations; new case law; and the willingness of the income tax authority to settle the issue, including the timing thereof.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans

The measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans is based on assumptions related to future events including interest rates, return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Actual plan asset performance will either reduce or increase losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which ultimately affects net income.

The discount rate for United States plans was determined by discounting the expected future benefit payments using a theoretical zero-coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high-quality bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single rate that generated the same benefit obligation. Only corporate bonds with a rating of Aa or higher by either Moody’s or Standard & Poor's were included. Callable bonds that are not make-whole bonds and certain other non-comparable bonds were eliminated. Finally, a subset of bonds was selected by grouping the universe of bonds by duration and retaining 50% of the bonds that had the highest yields.

The discount rates for non-United States plans were determined by region and are based on high quality long-term corporate and government bonds. Consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate.

To estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for the vast majority of its defined benefits pension and other postretirement benefits plans, the Company used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the relevant projected cash flows.

Key assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefits expense are adjusted at each year-end. A 1-percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets is estimated to have approximately a $49 effect on pension expense. Likewise, a 1-percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a $64 effect on pension expense. A 1-percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on other postretirement benefits assets is estimated to have less than $1 effect on other postretirement benefits expense. A 1-percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a $1 effect on expense for other postretirement benefits plans.

Additional information related to changes in key assumptions used to recognize expense for other postretirement benefits plans is found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE

On a regular basis, Eaton monitors third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and short-term investments, primarily for safety of principal and secondarily for maximizing yield on those funds. The Company diversifies its cash and short-term investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Eaton also monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and suppliers to mitigate any adverse impact.

Eaton uses derivative instruments to manage exposure to volatility in raw material costs, currency, and interest rates on certain debt instruments. Derivative financial instruments used by the Company are straightforward and non-leveraged. The counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings. Eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instruments.

Eaton’s ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is based on the strength of its credit rating and overall market conditions. The Company has not experienced any material limitations in its ability to access these sources of liquidity. At

December 31, 2019

, Eaton had

$2,000

of long-term revolving credit facilities with banks in support of its commercial paper program. It has no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.



Interest rate risk can be measured by calculating the short-term earnings impact that would result from adverse changes in interest rates. This exposure results from short-term debt, which includes commercial paper at a floating interest rate, long-term debt that has been swapped to floating rates, and money market investments that have not been swapped to fixed rates. Based upon the balances of investments and floating rate debt at year end


, a 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates would have increased the Company’s net, pre-tax interest expense by $20.

Eaton also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of the Company’s financial liabilities would change as a result of movements in interest rates. Based on Eaton’s best estimate for a hypothetical, 100 basis point increase in interest rates at

December 31, 2019

, the market value of the Company’s debt and interest rate swap portfolio, in aggregate, would increase by $515.

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to volatility in raw material costs and contractual agreements with suppliers. To partially mitigate this exposure, Eaton enters into commodity contracts for certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. These commodity contracts are designated for hedge accounting and are generally less than one year in duration. Based on Eaton’s best estimate for a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices the gain or loss would be less than $1. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. Any change in the value of the contracts would be offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged transactions.

The Company is exposed to currency risk associated with translating its functional currency financial statements into its reporting currency, which is the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. Eaton also monitors exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each country in which the Company operates, and regularly enters into forward contracts to mitigate that exposure. In the aggregate, Eaton’s portfolio of forward contracts related to such transactions was not material to its Consolidated Financial Statements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

A summary of contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2019

follows:


Interest expense related to long-term debt is based on the applicable interest rate related to the debt instrument, whether fixed or floating. The reduction of interest expense due to interest rate swap agreements related to long-term debt is based on the difference in the fixed interest rate the Company receives from the swap, compared to the floating interest rate the Company pays on the swap. Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business. These amounts include commitments for purchases of raw materials, outstanding non-cancelable purchase orders, releases under blanket purchase orders, and commitments under ongoing service arrangements. Other obligations principally include

$128

of anticipated contributions to pension plans in


, $34 of other postretirement benefits payments expected to be paid in


,   and $49 of deferred compensation earned under various plans for which the participants have elected to receive disbursement at a later date. The table above does not include all other future expected pension and other postretirement benefits payments. Information related to the amounts of these future payments is described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table above also excludes the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits, since the Company cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. At

December 31, 2019

, the gross liability for unrecognized income tax benefits totaled

$1,001

and interest and penalties were

$93

.
