net sales of

$19.7 billion

. The Company provides energy-efficient solutions that help its customers effectively manage electrical, hydraulic and mechanical power more efficiently, safely and sustainably. Eaton has approximately

95,000

employees in

over 60

countries and sells products to customers in more than


countries.

Eaton electronically files or furnishes reports pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and proxy and information statements, as well as any amendments to those reports. As soon as reasonably practicable, these reports are available free of charge through the Company's Internet website at http://www.eaton.com.

Business Segment Information

Information by business segment and geographic region regarding principal products, principal markets, methods of distribution, net sales, operating profit and assets is presented in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information regarding Eaton's segments and business is presented below.

Electrical Products and Electrical Systems and Services

Principal methods of competition in these segments are performance of products and systems, technology, customer service and support, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in these segments and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. In normal economic cycles, sales of these segments are historically lower in the first quarter and higher in the third and fourth quarters of a year. In


, 16% of these segments' sales were made to seven large distributors of electrical products and electrical systems and services.

Hydraulics

Principal methods of competition in this segment are product performance, geographic coverage, service, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. Sales of this segment are historically higher in the first and second quarters and lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year. In


, 11% of this segment's sales were made to three large original equipment manufacturers or distributors of agricultural, construction, and industrial equipment and parts.

Aerospace

Principal methods of competition in this segment are total cost of ownership, product and system performance, quality, design engineering capabilities, and timely delivery. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products and platforms, is considered among the market leaders. In


, 29% of this segment's sales were made to three large original equipment manufacturers of aircraft.

Vehicle

Principal methods of competition in this segment are product performance, technology, global service, and price. Eaton has a strong competitive position in this segment and, with respect to many products, is considered among the market leaders. In


, 68% of this segment's sales were made to nine large original equipment manufacturers of vehicles and related components.

Information Concerning Eaton's Business in General

Raw Materials

Eaton's major requirements for raw materials include iron, steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, brass, tin, silver, lead, molybdenum, titanium, vanadium, rubber, plastic, electronic components, insulating materials and fluids. Materials are purchased in various forms, such as extrusions, castings, powder metal, metal sheets and strips, forging billets, bar stock, and plastic pellets. Raw materials, as well as parts and other components, are purchased from many suppliers. Under normal circumstances, the Company has no difficulty obtaining its raw materials. In


, Eaton maintained appropriate levels of inventory to prevent shortages and did not experience any availability constraints.



Patents and Trademarks

Eaton considers its intellectual property, including without limitation patents, trade names, domain names, trademarks, confidential information, and trade secrets to be of significant value to its business as a whole. The Company's products are manufactured, marketed and sold under a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire or are allowed to lapse at various dates in the future. Eaton develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and considers all of its intellectual property to be valuable. Based on the broad scope of the Company's product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on Eaton's consolidated financial statements or its business segments. The Company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements.

Order Backlog

A significant portion of open orders placed with Eaton are by original equipment manufacturers or distributors. These open orders are not considered firm as they have been historically subject to month-to-month releases by customers. In measuring backlog orders, only the amount of orders to which customers are firmly committed are included. Using this criterion, total backlog at

December 31, 2016

and


was approximately $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. Backlog should not be relied upon as being indicative of results of operations for future periods.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses for new products and improvement of existing products in


,


and


were

$589 million

,

$625 million

, and

$647 million

, respectively. Over the past five years, the Company has invested approximately $2.9 billion in research and development.

Environmental Contingencies

Operations of the Company involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws. Eaton continues to modify processes on an ongoing, regular basis in order to reduce the impact on the environment, including the reduction or elimination of certain chemicals used in, and wastes generated from, operations. Compliance with laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon earnings or the competitive position of the Company. Eaton's estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not expected to be material for


and


. Information regarding the Company's liabilities related to environmental matters is presented in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Among the risks that could materially adversely affect Eaton's businesses, financial condition or results of operations are the following:

Volatility of end markets that Eaton serves.

Eaton's segment revenues, operating results, and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future. Profitability can be negatively impacted by volatility in the end markets that Eaton serves. The Company has undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of the markets it serves and expansion of the geographic regions in which it operates. Future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues, operating results, and profitability.

Eaton's operating results depend in part on continued successful research,

development, and marketing of new and/or improved products and services, and

there can be no assurance that Eaton will continue to successfully introduce

new products and services.

The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by Eaton's customers. The Company's businesses are affected, to varying degrees, by technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles. Eaton may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production, or marketing of new products and services which may prevent Eaton from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market.



Eaton's ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to the Company's results of operations and future growth.

Eaton depends on the continued services and performance of key executives, senior management, and skilled personnel, particularly professionals with experience in its industry and business. Eaton cannot be certain that any of these individuals will continue his or her employment with the Company. A lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart. An inability to hire, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder the business by, for example, delaying Eaton's ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of the Company's operations.

Eaton's operations depend on production facilities throughout the world, which subjects them to varying degrees of risk

of disrupted production.

Eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. The Company's manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strike, war, political unrest, terrorist activity, economic upheaval, or public health concerns. Some of these conditions are more likely in certain geographic regions in which Eaton operates. Any such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses.

If Eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality lost.

Eaton relies on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. These technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; or computer viruses. In addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the Company may suffer financial or reputational damage.

Eaton's global operations subject it to economic risk as Eaton's

results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government

regulations and policies and currency fluctuations.

Operating globally subjects Eaton to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, exchange controls, and repatriation of earnings. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect Eaton's operating results. While the Company monitors exchange rate exposures and attempts to reduce these exposures through hedging activities, these risks could adversely affect operating results.

Eaton may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.

Eaton is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions around the world. Income tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws. With the Administration change in the United States, tax reform is anticipated. It is uncertain what, if any, impact this reform may have to Eaton since proposals have not been reduced to legislative language at this time. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by tax authorities in the countries in which Eaton operates. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Company's tax liabilities.

Eaton uses a variety of raw materials and components in its businesses, and

significant shortages, price increases, or supplier insolvencies could increase

operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of Eaton's

products.

Eaton's major requirements for raw materials are described above in Item 1 “Raw Materials”. Significant shortages could affect the prices Eaton's businesses are charged and the competitive position of their products and services, all of which could adversely affect operating results.

Further, Eaton's suppliers of component parts may increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts. The Company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs, adversely affecting operating results.



Eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights,

which could affect the Company's ability to compete.

Protecting Eaton's intellectual property rights is critical to its ability to compete and succeed. The Company owns a large number of patents and patent applications worldwide, as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary, and contribute significantly, to the preservation of Eaton's competitive position in various markets. Although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of Eaton or its business segments, there can be no assurance that any one, or more, of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with the Company's employees, and into non-disclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers, so as to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information. These measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies.

Eaton is subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could

adversely impact Eaton's businesses.

At any given time, Eaton may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's businesses, financial condition or results of operations. Information regarding current legal proceedings is presented in Note 8 and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Legislative and regulatory action could materially adversely affect Eaton.

Legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the U.S. which, if ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties upon which Eaton relies or broaden the circumstances under which the Company would be considered a U.S. resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect its effective tax rate. Eaton cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals. However, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding the incorporation in Ireland or limiting Eaton's ability as an Irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the U.S., the Company could be subject to increased taxation and/or potentially significant expense.

Additionally, existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products could have an impact on our business and financial results.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

Eaton's principal executive offices are located at Eaton House, 30 Pembroke Road, Dublin 4, Ireland D04 Y0C2. The Company maintains manufacturing facilities at 330 locations in 42 countries. The Company is a lessee under a number of operating leases for certain real properties and equipment, none of which is material to its operations. Management believes that the existing manufacturing facilities are adequate for its operations and that the facilities are maintained in good condition.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Information regarding the Company's current legal proceedings is presented in Note 8 and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.

Not applicable.

Part II

Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Ordinary Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

The Company's ordinary shares are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At

December 31, 2016

, there were

17,627

holders of record of the Company's ordinary shares. Additionally,

21,235

current and former employees were shareholders through participation in the Eaton Savings Plan (ESP), Eaton Personal Investment Plan (EPIP), and the Eaton Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan.

Information regarding cash dividends paid, and the high and low market price per ordinary share, for each quarter in


and


is presented in “Quarterly Data” of this Form 10-K. Information regarding equity-based compensation plans required by Regulation S-K Item 201(d) is provided in Item 12 of this Form 10-K Report.

Irish Taxes Applicable to Dividends

In certain circumstances, Eaton will be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 20%) from dividends paid to its shareholders. In the majority of cases, however, shareholders resident in the U.S. will not be subject to Irish withholding tax, and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to Irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain Irish tax forms. Effective January 1, 2018, shareholders that reside in the US who hold their shares outside of a Depository Trust Company will be subject to Irish withholding tax on dividends unless they complete certain Irish tax forms.

Irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on Eaton shares. Dividends paid in respect of Eaton shares will generally not be subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these shares is exempt from dividend withholding tax, unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Eaton.

Eaton shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Eaton.

Fearon - Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, Eaton's management concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Eaton Corporation plc

We have audited Eaton Corporation plc’s (“the Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of

December 31, 2016

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2016

and our report dated

February 22, 2017

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General Information and Basis of Presentation

Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton or the Company) is a power management company with


net sales of

$19.7 billion

. The Company provides energy-efficient solutions that help its customers effectively manage electrical, hydraulic and mechanical power more efficiently, safely and sustainably. Eaton has approximately

95,000

employees in

over 60

countries and sells products to customers in more than


countries.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements were filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eaton and all subsidiaries and other entities it controls. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in associate companies where the Company has significant influence and generally a

20%

to

50%

ownership interest. Equity investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the book value of the investment exceeds fair value. An impairment would exist if there is an other-than-temporary decline in value. These associate companies are not material either individually, or in the aggregate, to Eaton's consolidated financial statements. Eaton does not have off-balance sheet arrangements or financings with unconsolidated entities. In the ordinary course of business, the Company leases certain real properties and equipment, as described in Note 8.

Eaton's functional currency is United States Dollars (USD). The functional currency for most subsidiaries is their local currency. Financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates as to assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates as to revenues and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

During


, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (ASU 2015-03). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than an asset. The Company has applied this standard retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-03 resulted in the reclassification of

$35

within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, from Other noncurrent assets to a reduction in Long-term debt.

During 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (ASU 2015-07). Topic 820 allows for investments to be valued at their net asset value if their share price is not published for current transactions (referred to as the practical expedient). Prior to ASU 2015-07, there has been diversity in practice related to how investments measured using the practical expedient are categorized within the fair value hierarchy. With the adoption of ASU 2015-07, these investments are no longer categorized in the fair value hierarchy, which eliminates the diversity in practice resulting from the way in which these investments were classified. In addition, ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for these investments. The Company retrospectively applied the requirements of ASU 2015-07 for all comparative periods presented in Note 7 resulting in investments measured using the net asset value practical expedient no longer being categorized in the fair value hierarchy.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.



Revenue Recognition

Sales of products are recognized when a sales agreement is in place, products have been shipped to unaffiliated customers and title has transferred in accordance with shipping terms, the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, all significant related acts of performance have been completed, and no other significant uncertainties exist. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in Net sales and the related costs in Cost of products sold. Although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes, and, if so, how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element. For delivered elements, sales generally are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided.

Eaton records reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates, at the time of the initial sale. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets Eaton serves, but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels.

Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets

Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is equivalent to Eaton's operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment, including goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill is assigned to each operating segment, as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results. The Company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis. Additionally, goodwill is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying amount.

Goodwill impairment testing for 2016 was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value for each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model, which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted-average cost of capital. The forecasted cash flows were based on the Company's long-term operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segment's cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. Sensitivity analyses were performed around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values.

Goodwill impairment testing in 2015 was performed using qualitative analysis, which is performed by assessing certain trends and factors, including projected market outlook and growth rates, forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins, discount rates, industry data, and other relevant qualitative factors. These trends and factors are compared to, and based on, the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment performed in 2013. The results of the qualitative analysis did not indicate a need to perform a quantitative analysis.

Based on a quantitative analysis performed in 2016 and a qualitative analysis performed in 2015, the fair value of Eaton's reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts.

Indefinite life intangible assets consist of certain trademarks. They are evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis to determine whether their fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts. Indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing for


and


was performed using a quantitative analysis. The Company determines the fair value of these assets using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired, but using updated estimates of future sales, cash flows and profitability. Additionally, indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. For


and


, the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying value.

For additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 5.



Other Long-Lived Assets

Depreciation and amortization for property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are generally computed by the straight-line method and included in Cost of products sold, Selling and administrative expense, and Research and development expense, as appropriate. Cost of buildings are depreciated generally over

40 years

and machinery and equipment over


to

10 years

. At

December 31, 2016

, the weighted-average amortization period for intangible assets subject to amortization was

17 years

for patents and technology, primarily as a result of the long life of aircraft platforms;

17 years

for customer relationships; and

16 years

for certain trademarks. Software is generally amortized up to a life of

10 years

.

Other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Upon indications of impairment, assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value. Determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgment.

Retirement Benefits Plans

For the principal pension plans in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, the Company uses a market-related value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit costs. The market-related value of plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period. All other plans use fair value of plan assets.

Net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor. The Company’s corridors are set at either

8%

or

10%

, depending on the plan, of the greater of the plan assets or benefit obligations. Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over an average employee future service period that differs by plan, but is approximately 13 years on a weighted average basis. If most or all of the plan’s participants are no longer actively accruing benefits, the average life expectancy is used.

Warranty Accruals

Product warranty accruals are established at the time the related sale is recognized through a charge to Cost of products sold. Warranty accrual estimates are based primarily on historical warranty claim experience and specific customer contracts. Provisions for warranty accruals are comprised of basic warranties for products sold, as well as accruals for product recalls and other events when they are known and estimable. See Note 8 for additional information about warranty accruals.

Asset Retirement Obligations

A conditional asset retirement obligation is recognized at fair value when incurred if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation would be considered in the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. Eaton believes that for substantially all of its asset retirement obligations, there is an indeterminate settlement date because the range of time over which the Company may settle the obligation is unknown or cannot be estimated. A liability for these obligations will be recognized when sufficient information is available to estimate fair value.

Income Taxes

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of the respective assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards. Judgment is required in determining and evaluating income tax provisions and valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets. Eaton recognizes the income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Eaton evaluates and adjusts these accruals based on changing facts and circumstances. Eaton recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income tax expense. Penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits have been accrued for jurisdictions where penalties are automatically applied to any deficiency, regardless of the merit of the position. For additional information about income taxes, see Note 9.



Equity-Based Compensation

Eaton recognizes equity-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award. Awards with service conditions or both service and market conditions are expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Awards with both service and performance conditions are expensed over the period an employee is required to provide service based on the number of units for which achievement of the performance objective is probable. Participants awarded restricted stock units (RSUs) do not receive dividends; therefore, their fair value is determined by reducing the closing market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends had they been paid. The fair value of restricted stock awards (RSAs) and performance stock units (PSUs) with performance conditions are determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of grant. The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of PSUs with market conditions, which incorporates assumptions regarding expected stock price volatility and the risk-free interest rate. Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of Eaton ordinary shares on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates assumptions regarding the expected stock price volatility, the expected option life, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. See Note 11 for additional information about equity-based compensation.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

Eaton uses derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure to the volatility in raw material costs, currency, and interest rates on certain debt. These instruments are marked to fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized depending upon the type of hedging relationship and whether an instrument has been designated as a hedge. For those instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, Eaton designates the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in fair value of these instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in net income. See Note 13 for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instruments.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). This accounting standard supersedes all existing US GAAP revenue recognition guidance. Under ASU 2014-09, a company will recognize revenue when it transfers the control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to collect in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will require additional disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date (ASU 2015-14). This accounting standard defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and permits early adoption as of the original effective date.

A cross-functional implementation team has been established consisting of representatives from all of our business segments. The implementation team is working to analyze the impact of the standard on the Company's contract portfolio by reviewing current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to revenue contracts. In addition, the Company is in the process of identifying and implementing the appropriate changes to business processes and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard. Eaton plans to adopt the standard as of the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and will record a cumulative adjustment to equity for open contracts as of January 1, 2018. Certain revenues will move from point-in-time or multiple elements to over time because of the continuous transfer of control to customers. Eaton is continuing to evaluate the impact of ASU 2014-09 and an estimate of the impact to the consolidated financial statements cannot be made at this time.

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), (ASU 2016-02). This accounting standard requires that a lessee recognize a lease asset and a lease liability on its balance sheet for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 will require additional disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Eaton is evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 and an estimate of the impact to the consolidated financial statements cannot be made at this time.



In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (ASU 2016-09). The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The new standard eliminates the accounting for excess tax benefits to be recognized in equity, and tax deficiencies recognized in either equity or the income tax provision. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company will adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2017. Upon adoption, the Company anticipates recognizing deferred tax assets for all excess tax benefits that had not been previously recognized. This will be accomplished through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings and is not expected to have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

based on the September 20, 2016 spot rate) from the issuance, net of financing costs and discounts. The senior Euro Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Euro Notes contain an optional redemption provision by which the Company may make an offer to purchase all or any part of the Euro Notes prior to June 20, 2024 at a purchase price of the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the respective Euro Notes being redeemed, or (b) the sum of the present values of the respective remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, discounted to the redemption date on an annual basis at the benchmark Bund Rate plus 20 basis points. In each case, the redemption price will include any accrued and unpaid interest on the Euro Notes being redeemed. At any time on or after June 20, 2024, the Company may redeem the Euro Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Euro Notes also contain a change of control provision which requires the Company to make an offer to purchase all or any part of the Euro Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The capitalized deferred financing fees and discounts are amortized in Interest expense - net over the respective terms of the Euro Notes.

Retirement Benefits Plans Assumptions

For purposes of determining liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans in the United States, the Company updated its mortality assumption in 2014 to use the RP-2014 tables with a generational improvement scale based on MP-2014. In 2015, the Company updated its mortality assumption to use 2014 tables and a generational improvement scale that are based on MP-2015. In 2016, the Company updated its mortality assumption to use 2014 tables and a generational improvement scale that are based on MP-2016.

In 2016, the Company adopted a change in the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Prior to 2016, for the vast majority of its plans, the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, the Company used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in the estimation of the service and interest components of benefit cost, resulting in a more precise measurement. This change does not affect the measurement of total benefit obligations. The change was accounted for as a change in estimate and, accordingly, was accounted for prospectively starting in 2016. The reductions in service cost and interest cost for 2016 associated with this change in estimate were

$3

and

$42

, respectively.

Pension Plans

The expected long-term rate of return on pension assets was determined for each country and reflects long-term historical data taking into account each plan's target asset allocation. The expected long-term rates of return on pension assets for United States pension plans and Non-United States pension plans for 2017 are 7.90% and 6.30%, respectively. The discount rates were determined using appropriate bond data for each country.



Other Postretirement Benefits Plans

Substantially all of the obligation for other postretirement benefits plans relates to United States plans. Assumptions used to determine other postretirement benefits obligations and expense follow:

Assumed health care cost trend rates may have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A 1-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

For other postretirement benefits liabilities, the expected subsidy receipts related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 would reduce the gross payments listed below.



Pension Plan Assets

Investment policies and strategies are developed on a country specific basis. The United States plans, representing

67%

of worldwide pension assets, and the United Kingdom plans representing

27%

of worldwide pension assets, are invested primarily for growth, as the majority of the assets are in plans with active participants and ongoing accruals. In general, the plans have their primary allocation to diversified global equities, primarily through index funds in the form of common collective and other trusts. The United States plans' target allocation is

33%

United States equities,

32%

non-United States equities,

8%

real estate (primarily equity of real estate investment trusts),

22%

debt securities and

5%

other, including hedge funds, private equity and cash equivalents. The United Kingdom plans' target asset allocations are

57%

equities and

the remainder

in debt securities, cash equivalents and real estate investments. The equity risk for the plans is managed through broad geographic diversification and diversification across industries and levels of market capitalization. The majority of debt allocations for these plans are longer duration government and corporate debt. The United States, United Kingdom and Canada pension plans are authorized to use derivatives to achieve more economically desired market exposures and to use futures, swaps and options to gain or hedge exposures.

Other Postretirement Benefits Plan Assets

The Voluntary Employee Benefit Association trust which holds U.S. other postretirement benefits plan assets has investment guidelines that include allocations to global equities and fixed income investments. The trust's 2016 target investment allocation is

53%

diversified global equities and

47%

fixed income securities held in a trust that invests primarily in exchange traded funds. The fixed income allocation is primarily comprised of intermediate term, high quality, dollar denominated, fixed income instruments. The equity allocation is invested in diversified global equity index funds.

Fair Value Measurements

Financial instruments included in pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets are categorized into a fair value hierarchy of three levels, based on the degree of subjectivity inherent in the valuation methodology as follows:

Level 1  -

Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets.

Level 2  -

Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3  -

Unobservable prices or inputs.

Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables to permit a reconciliation to total plan assets.

Valuation Methodologies

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at

December 31, 2016

and


.

Common collective and other trusts -

Valued at the net unit value of units held by the trust at year end. The unit value is determined by the total value of fund assets divided by the total number of units of the fund owned. The equity investments in collective trusts are predominantly in index funds for which the underlying securities are actively traded in public markets based upon readily measurable prices. The investments in other trusts are predominantly in exchange traded funds for which the underlying securities are actively traded in public markets based upon readily measurable prices. Common collective and other trusts measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total plan assets.

Fixed income securities -

These securities consist of publicly traded United States and non-United States fixed interest obligations (principally corporate and government bonds and debentures). The fair value of corporate and government debt securities is determined through third-party pricing models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curves, credit ratings, and current market prices. The Company verifies the results of trustees or custodians and evaluates the pricing classification of these securities by performing analyses using other third-party sources.

United States treasuries -

Valued at the closing price of each security.

Bank loans -

These securities consist of senior secured term loans of publicly traded and privately held United States and non-United States floating rate obligations (principally corporations of non-investment grade rating). The fair value is determined through third-party pricing models that primarily utilize dealer quoted current market prices. The Company verifies the results of trustees or custodians and evaluates the pricing classification of these securities by performing analyses using other third-party sources.



Real estate and equity securities -

These securities consist of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. Such investments are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded. As such, the direct investments are classified as Level 1.

Cash equivalents -

Primarily certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements.

Exchange traded funds -

Valued at the closing price of the exchange traded fund's shares.

Hedge funds

- Consists of direct investments in hedge funds through limited partnership interests. Net asset values are based on the estimated fair value of the ownership interest in the investment as determined by the General Partner. The majority of the holdings of the hedge funds are in equity securities traded on public exchanges. The investment terms of the hedge funds allow capital to be redeemed quarterly given prior notice with certain limitations. Hedge funds measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total plan assets.

Money market funds

- Money market funds measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total plan assets.

Other -

Primarily insurance contracts for international plans and also futures contracts and over-the-counter options. These investments are valued based on the closing prices of future contracts or indices as available on Bloomberg or similar service, and private equity investments.

For additional information regarding fair value measurements, see Note 12.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company has various defined contribution benefit plans, primarily consisting of the plans in the United States. The total contributions related to these plans are charged to expense and were as follows:

Note 8.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Contingencies

Eaton is subject to a broad range of claims, administrative and legal proceedings such as lawsuits that relate to contractual allegations, tax audits, patent infringement, personal injuries, antitrust matters and employment-related matters. Eaton is also subject to asbestos claims from historic products which may have contained asbestos. Insurance may cover some of the costs associated with these claims. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome or cost of these matters, the Company believes they will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company was able to resolve several insurance matters. In total, the income from insurance matters was $68.

In December 2010, a Brazilian court held that a judgment obtained by a Brazilian company, Raysul, against another Brazilian company, Saturnia, which was sold by Eaton in


, could be enforced against Eaton Ltda. The judgment was based on an alleged violation of an agency agreement between Raysul and Saturnia. At March 31, 2016, the Company had a total accrual of


Brazilian Reais related to this matter (

$31

based on June 2016 exchange rates). In June 2016, Eaton signed a settlement agreement and resolved the matter, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

On October 5, 2006, ZF Meritor LLC and Meritor Transmission Corporation (collectively, Meritor) filed an action against Eaton in the United States District Court for Delaware. The action sought damages, which would have been trebled under United States antitrust laws, as well as injunctive relief and costs. The suit alleged that Eaton engaged in anti-competitive conduct against Meritor in the sale of heavy-duty truck transmissions in North America. On June 23, 2014, Eaton announced it signed a settlement agreement with Meritor in the amount of

$500

that resolved the lawsuit and removed the uncertainty of a trial and appeal process. On July 16, 2014, Eaton paid Meritor the

$500

.



Frisby Corporation, now known as Triumph Actuation Systems, LLC, and other claimants (collectively, Triumph) asserted claims alleging, among other things, unfair competition, defamation, malicious prosecution, deprivation of civil rights, and antitrust in the Hinds County Circuit Court of Mississippi in 2004 and in the Federal District Court of North Carolina in 2011. Eaton had asserted claims against Triumph regarding improper use of trade secrets and these claims were dismissed by the Hinds County Circuit Court. On June 18, 2014, Eaton announced it signed a settlement agreement with Triumph in the amount of

$147.5

that resolved all claims and lawsuits and removed the uncertainty of a trial and appeal process. On July 8, 2014, Eaton paid Triumph the

$147.5

.

Environmental Contingencies

Eaton has established policies to ensure that its operations are conducted in keeping with good corporate citizenship and with a positive commitment to the protection of the natural and workplace environments. The Company's manufacturing facilities are required to be certified to ISO 14001, an international standard for environmental management systems. The Company routinely reviews EHS performance at each of its facilities and continuously strives to improve pollution prevention.

Eaton is involved in remedial response and voluntary environmental remediation at a number of sites, including certain of its currently-owned or formerly-owned plants. The Company has also been named a potentially responsible party under the United States federal Superfund law, or the state equivalents thereof, at a number of disposal sites. The Company became involved in these sites as a result of government action or in connection with business acquisitions. At the end of


, the Company was involved with a total of


sites worldwide, including the Superfund sites mentioned above, with

none

of these sites being individually significant to the Company.

Remediation activities, generally involving soil and/or groundwater contamination, include pre-cleanup activities such as fact finding and investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study, design and action planning, performance (where actions may range from monitoring, to removal of contaminants, to installation of longer-term remediation systems), and operation and maintenance of a remediation system. The extent of expected remediation activities and costs varies by site. A number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation, including the number of parties involved at a particular site, the determination of the extent of contamination, the length of time the remediation may require, the complexity of environmental regulations, and the continuing advancement of remediation technology. Taking these factors into account, Eaton has estimated the costs of remediation, which will be paid over a period of years. The Company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis, consistent with the estimates of these costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred. Actual results may differ from these estimates. At

December 31, 2016

and


, the Company had an accrual totaling

$124

and

$131

, respectively, for these costs.

Based upon Eaton's analysis and subject to the difficulty in estimating these future costs, the Company expects that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters is not reasonably possible to exceed the recorded liability by an amount that would have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Warranty Accruals

A summary of the current and long-term warranty accruals follows:



Lease Commitments

Eaton leases certain real properties and equipment. A summary of minimum rental commitments at

December 31, 2016

under noncancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates and in most cases contain renewal options, for each of the next five years and thereafter in the aggregate, follow:

INCOME TAXES

Eaton Corporation plc is domiciled in Ireland. Income (loss) before income taxes and income tax (benefit) expense are summarized below based on the geographic location of the operation to which such earnings and income taxes are attributable. Certain Eaton operations which are located outside the United States are subject to income tax in both the United States as well as the country in which the operations are located. As a result, income before tax by location and the components of income tax expense by taxing jurisdiction are not directly related.



Reconciliations of income taxes from the Ireland national statutory rate of 25% to the consolidated effective income tax rate follow:

During


, income tax expense of

$202

was recognized (an effective tax rate of

9.5%

) compared to income tax expense of

$164

for


(an effective tax rate of

7.7%

) and income tax benefit of

$42

for


(an effective tax benefit rate of

2.4%

). The


effective tax rate increased from


primarily due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by net decreases in worldwide tax liabilities. In 2014, excluding the net tax benefit of

7.6%

for the Meritor and Triumph litigation settlements and related legal costs and the gain on the sale of the Aerospace businesses, the effective tax rate was

5.2%

. The 2015 effective tax rate increased from 2014 due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions and net increases in worldwide tax liabilities.

See Note 8 and Note 2 for additional information about litigation settlements and sales of businesses, respectively.

No provision has been made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately

$17.3 billion

at

December 31, 2016

, since it is the Company's intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable withholding taxes that would be payable on the remittance of such undistributed earnings.

The Company expects to deploy capital to those markets which offer particularly attractive growth opportunities. Given expected population growth and economic growth rates, most of the particularly attractive markets are outside of the United States. The cash that is permanently reinvested is typically used to expand these operations either organically or through acquisitions. In addition, the Company expects that minimal to no Irish tax would apply to dividends paid to the Irish parent due to the impact of the Irish foreign tax credit system. The Company's public dividends and share repurchases are funded primarily from Non-U.S. operations.

Worldwide income tax payments, net of tax refunds, follow:



Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities

Components of current and noncurrent deferred income taxes follow:

In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11). ASU 2013-11 requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions except where the deferred tax asset or other carryforward are not available for use. The adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction of the Company’s consolidated long term deferred tax assets by

$331

in


and

$262

in


.

At

December 31, 2016

, certain Irish and non-United States subsidiaries had tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities. These carryforwards and their respective expiration dates are summarized below:



At

December 31, 2016

, United States federal income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards are available to reduce future United States federal taxable income or tax liabilities. These carryforwards and their respective expiration dates are summarized below:

At

December 31, 2016

, United States state and local tax loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are also available to reduce future taxable income or tax liabilities. The deferred tax assets for these carryforwards and their respective expiration dates are summarized below:

Recoverability of Deferred Income Tax Assets

Eaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In order to determine its income tax provision for financial statement purposes, Eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions. These estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards.



Management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. If the Company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in the

three

-year period including the current and prior two years, management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized, unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise. However, if the Company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the

three

-year period including the current and prior two years, management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized. These factors include historical operating results, known or planned operating developments, the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse, consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities, tax law carryback capability in the particular country, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as those used for the Company's goodwill and other impairment testing. After evaluation of these factors, if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country, management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required. To the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction, management would establish a valuation allowance.

Applying the above methodology, valuation allowances have been established for certain deferred income tax assets to the extent they are not expected to be realized within the particular tax carryforward period.

Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits

A summary of gross unrecognized income tax benefits follows:

Eaton's long-term policy has been to enter into tax planning strategies only if it is more likely than not that the benefit would be sustained upon audit. For example, the Company does not enter into any of the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Listed Transactions as set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.6011-4.

If all unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, the net impact on the provision for income tax expense would be

$529

.

As of

December 31, 2016

and


, Eaton had accrued approximately

$94

and

$108

, respectively, for the payment of worldwide interest and penalties, which are not included in the table of unrecognized income tax benefits above. Eaton recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income tax expense. The Company has accrued penalties in jurisdictions primarily where they are automatically applied to any deficiency, regardless of the merit of the position.

The resolution of the majority of Eaton's unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as the prospect of retroactive regulations; new case law; the willingness of the income tax authority to settle the issue, including the timing thereof; and other factors. Therefore, for the majority of unrecognized income tax benefits, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the next 12 months. For each of the unrecognized income tax benefits where it is possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the balance within the next 12 months, the Company does not anticipate any significant change.

Eaton or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in Ireland and many countries around the world. With only few exceptions, Irish and non-United States subsidiaries of Eaton are no longer subject to examinations for years before 2007.



The United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examination of Eaton Corporation and Includible Subsidiaries’ United States income tax returns for


through


and has issued Statutory Notices of Deficiency (Notices) as discussed below. The statute of limitations on these tax years remains open until the matters are resolved. The IRS is currently examining tax years 2011 through 2013. The statute of limitations for tax years 2011 through 2013 is open until April 30, 2018. Tax years 2014 and 2015 are still subject to examination by the IRS.

With respect to the BZ Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries (the former U.S. holding company for Cooper Industries) final return period ended December 21, 2012, the statute of limitations closed on September 15, 2016. On December 22, 2012, BZ Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries joined the Eaton US Holdings Inc. and Includible Subsidiaries consolidated United States income tax return for 2012.

Eaton is also under examination for the income tax filings in various states and localities of the United States. With only a few exceptions, Eaton Corporation and Includible Subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax examinations from states and localities within the United States for years before 2012. Income tax returns of states and localities within the United States will be reopened to the extent of United States federal income tax adjustments, if any, going back to 2005 when those audit years are finalized. Some states and localities may not limit their assessment to the United States federal adjustments, and may require the opening of the entire tax year. In addition, with only a few exceptions, BZ Holdings Inc. and Includible Subsidiaries are no longer subject to United States state and local income tax examinations for years before 2012.

In 2011, the IRS issued a Notice for Eaton Corporation and Includible Subsidiaries for the 2005 and 2006 tax years (the 2011 Notice). The 2011 Notice proposed assessments of

$75

in additional taxes plus

$52

in penalties related primarily to transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in the Company's facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S., net of agreed credits and deductions. The Company has set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates at the same prices that the Company sells such products to third parties as required by two successive Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) the Company entered into with the IRS. For the years 2001 through 2004, the IRS had previously accepted the transfer pricing methodology related to these APAs after a comprehensive review conducted in two separate audit cycles. Immediately prior to the 2011 Notice being issued, the IRS sent a letter stating that it was retrospectively canceling the APAs, even though their respective APA terms had already expired.

The Company is contesting the proposed assessments. The Company believes that it was in full compliance with the terms of the two APAs, and that the IRS's cancellation of these two APAs is without merit. On February 29, 2012, the Company filed a Petition with the U.S. Tax Court in which it asserted that the transfer pricing established in the APAs meets the arms-length standard set by the U.S. income tax laws, and accordingly, that the APAs should be enforced in accordance with their terms. The case involves both whether the APAs should be enforced and, if not, the appropriate transfer pricing methodology. The Tax Court’s decision in the case is now pending following a trial in 2015 and the completion of the parties’ briefing in 2016.

In 2014, the Company received a Notice from the IRS for the 2007 through 2010 tax years (the 2014 Notice) proposing assessments of

$190

in additional taxes plus

$72

in penalties, net of agreed credits and deductions. The proposed assessments pertain primarily to the same transfer pricing issues for which the Tax Court’s decision is pending, as noted above. During 2007 through 2010, the Company set its transfer prices for products sold between its affiliates consistent with the terms of a written APA between it and the IRS that covered the years at issue. To establish the relevant transfer prices, the APA relied on prices at which the Company sells the products to third parties. The Company has continued to apply the arms-length transfer pricing methodology for 2011 through the current reporting period. The 2014 Notice includes a separate proposed assessment involving the recognition of income for several of the Company’s controlled foreign corporations. The Company believes that all proposed assessments are without merit. On November 25, 2014, the Company filed a Petition with the U.S. Tax Court in which it challenged the IRS's adjustments. The Company expects the outcome of the 2014 Notice on the transfer pricing matter to be determined by the judicial decision related to the 2011 Notice. In 2016, litigation activities commenced for the separate issue in the 2014 Notice regarding recognition of income for several of the Company’s controlled foreign corporations.

In 2014 and 2016, the Company resolved uncertain tax positions with a European government. The resolutions had minimal impact on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income in each respective year.



During 2010, the Company received a tax assessment of

$51

(translated at the December 31, 2016 exchange rate), plus interest and penalties, in Brazil for the tax years 2005 through 2008 that relates to the amortization of certain goodwill generated from the acquisition of third-party businesses and corporate reorganizations. The Company is contesting the assessment, which is under review at the second of three administrative appeals levels. During 2013, the Brazilian tax authorities began an audit of tax years 2009 through 2012. During 2014, the Company received a tax assessment of

$39

(translated at the December 31, 2016 exchange rate), plus interest and penalties, for the 2009 through 2012 tax years (primarily relating to the same issues concerning the 2005 through 2008 tax years), which the Company is also contesting and is under review in the second of three administrative appeals levels. Multiple outside advisors have stated that Brazilian tax authorities are raising the issue for most clients with similar facts and that the matter is expected to require at least


years to resolve. The Company continues to believe that final resolution of the assessments will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 11.

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

Restricted Stock Units and Awards

Restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock awards (RSAs) have been issued to certain employees and directors. Participants awarded RSUs do not receive dividends; therefore, the fair value is determined by reducing the closing market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends had they been paid. The RSUs entitle the holder to receive one ordinary share for each RSU upon vesting, generally over three years. The fair value of RSAs is determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of grant. RSAs are issued and outstanding at the time of grant, but remain subject to forfeiture until vested, generally over three or four years. A summary of the RSU and RSA activity for


follows:

Information related to RSUs and RSAs follows:

As of

December 31, 2016

, total compensation expense not yet recognized related to non-vested RSUs and RSAs was

2.5

years. Excess tax benefit for RSUs and RSAs totaled

$5

for


. There was

no

excess tax benefit for RSUs and RSAs in

Performance Share Units

In February 2016, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors approved the grant of performance share units (PSUs) to certain employees that vest based on the satisfaction of a three-year service period and total shareholder return relative to that of a group of peers. Awards earned at the end of the three-year vesting period range from

0%

to

200%

of the targeted number of PSUs granted based on the ranking of total shareholder return of the Company, assuming reinvestment of all dividends, relative to a defined peer group of companies. Equity-based compensation expense for these PSUs is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Upon vesting, dividends that have accumulated during the vesting period are paid on earned awards.

The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of PSUs with market conditions. The principal assumptions utilized in valuing these PSUs include the expected stock price volatility (based on the most recent 3-year period as of the grant date) and the risk-free interest rate (an estimate based on the yield of United States Treasury zero coupon bonds with a 3-year maturity as of the grant date). A summary of the assumptions used in determining fair value of these PSUs follows:



A summary of the


activity for these PSUs follows:


Performance shares granted assuming the Company will perform at target relative to peers.

In February


and


, performance share units were granted to certain employees that entitles the holder to receive one ordinary share for each PSU that vest based on the satisfaction of a three-year service period and the achievement of certain performance metrics over that same period. Upon vesting, PSU holders receive dividends that accumulate during the vesting period. The fair value of these PSUs is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's ordinary shares at the date of grant. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized over the period an employee is required to provide service based on the number of PSUs for which achievement of the performance objectives is probable. A summary of the 2016 activity for these PSUs follows:

Information related to PSUs follows:

As of

December 31, 2016

Stock Options

Under various plans, stock options have been granted to certain employees and directors to purchase ordinary shares at prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Substantially all of these options vest ratably during the

-year period following the date of grant and expire

10 years

from the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized for stock options based on the fair value of the options at the date of grant and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period the employee or director is required to provide service.



The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The principal assumptions utilized in valuing stock options include the expected stock price volatility (based on the most recent historical period equal to the expected life of the option); the expected option life (an estimate based on historical experience); the expected dividend yield; and the risk-free interest rate (an estimate based on the yield of United States Treasury zero coupon with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option). A summary of the assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options follows:

A summary of stock option activity follows:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total excess of the

$67.09

closing price of Eaton ordinary shares on the last trading day of


over the exercise price of the stock option, multiplied by the related number of options outstanding and exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value is not recognized for financial accounting purposes and the value changes based on the daily changes in the fair market value of the Company's ordinary shares.

Information related to stock options follows:

As of

December 31, 2016

, total compensation expense not yet recognized related to non-vested stock options was

$10.6

, and the weighted-average period in which the expense is expected to be recognized is

1.9

years.



Note 12.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is measured based on an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to satisfy a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a fair value hierarchy is established, which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

A summary of financial instruments recognized at fair value, and the fair value measurements used, follows:

Eaton values its financial instruments using an industry standard market approach, in which prices and other relevant information is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. No financial instruments were measured using unobservable inputs.

Other Fair Value Measurements

Long-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt had a carrying value of

$8,263

and fair value of

$8,477

at

December 31, 2016

compared to

$7,988

and

$8,231

, respectively, at

December 31, 2015

. The fair value of Eaton's debt instruments was estimated using prevailing market interest rates on debt with similar creditworthiness, terms and maturities and is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement.

Short-Term Investments

Eaton invests excess cash generated from operations in short-term marketable investments. For those investments classified as “available-for-sale”, Eaton marks these investments to fair value with the offset recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. A summary of the carrying value of short-term investments follows:



Note 13.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

In the normal course of business, Eaton is exposed to certain risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company uses various derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, currency forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and, to a lesser extent, commodity contracts, to manage risks from these market fluctuations. The instruments used by Eaton are straightforward, non-leveraged instruments. The counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings. Eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions. Such instruments are not purchased and sold for trading purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated, and is effective, as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, as to the nature of the hedging activity. Eaton formally documents all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges and the hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative financial instruments to a recognized asset or liability, specific firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or net investment in a foreign operation. These financial instruments can be designated as:

•

Hedges of the change in the fair value of a recognized fixed-rate asset or liability, or the firm commitment to acquire such an asset or liability (a fair value hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in income during the period of change in fair value.

•

Hedges of the variable cash flows of a recognized variable-rate asset or liability, or the forecasted acquisition of such an asset or liability (a cash flow hedge); for these hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss on the hedged item is included in income.

•

Hedges of the currency exposure related to a net investment in a foreign operation (a net investment hedge); for these hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss related to the net investment in the foreign operation is included in income.

The gain or loss from a derivative financial instrument designated as a hedge that is effective is classified in the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Income as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. The change in fair value of a derivative financial instrument that is not effective as a hedge is immediately recognized in income.

For derivatives that are not designated as a hedge, any gain or loss is immediately recognized in income. The majority of derivatives used in this manner relate to risks resulting from assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and certain commodity contracts that arise in the normal course of business. During


, Eaton recognized a gain of

$7

associated with these commodity hedge contracts. Gains and losses associated with commodity hedge contracts are classified in Cost of products sold.

Eaton uses certain of its debt denominated in foreign currency to hedge portions of its net investments in foreign operations against foreign currency exposure (net investment hedges). Foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative net investment hedging instruments on an after-tax basis was

$86

and

$83

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, and designated on a pre-tax basis was

$572

at

December 31, 2016

. See Note 6 for additional information about debt.

Interest Rate Risk

Eaton has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk of certain long-term debt. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges of certain long-term debt. The maturity of the swap corresponds with the maturity of the debt instrument as noted in the table of long-term debt in Note 6. Eaton has also entered into several forward starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on an anticipated debt refinancing in 2017.



A summary of interest rate swaps outstanding at

December 31, 2016

, follows:

Fixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps

Forward Starting Floating-to-Fixed Interest Rate Swaps



Derivative Financial Statement Impacts

The fair value of derivative financial instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets follows:

The currency exchange contracts shown in the table above as derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily contracts entered into to manage currency volatility or exposure on intercompany sales and loans. While Eaton does not elect hedge accounting treatment for these derivatives, Eaton targets managing

100%

of the intercompany balance sheet exposure to minimize the effect of currency volatility related to the movement of goods and services in the normal course of its operations. This activity represents the great majority of these currency exchange contracts.



The impact of derivative instruments to the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income follow:

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY

Accounts Receivable

Eaton performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and maintains sufficient allowances for potential credit losses. The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on the length of time the receivable is past due and any anticipated future write-off based on historic experience. Accounts receivable balances are written off against an allowance for doubtful accounts after a final determination of uncollectability has been made. Accounts receivable are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of

$50

at

December 31, 2016

and


.

Inventory

Inventory is carried at lower of cost or market. Inventory in the United States is generally accounted for using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Remaining United States and non-United States inventory is accounted for using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Cost components include raw materials, purchased components, direct labor, indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, and costs of the distribution network.

The components of inventory follow:

Inventory at FIFO accounted for using the LIFO method was

44%

and

43%

at the end of 2016 and 2015, respectively.



Note 15.

BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION INFORMATION

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. Eaton’s segments are as follows:

Electrical Products and Electrical Systems and Services

The Electrical Products segment consists of electrical components, industrial components, residential products, single phase power quality, emergency lighting, fire detection, wiring devices, structural support systems, circuit protection, and lighting products.

The principal markets for these segments are industrial, institutional, governmental, utility, commercial, residential and information technology. These products are used wherever there is a demand for electrical power in commercial buildings, data centers, residences, apartment and office buildings, hospitals, factories, utilities, and industrial and energy facilities. The segments share several common global customers, but a large number of customers are located regionally. Sales are made directly to original equipment manufacturers, utilities, and certain other end users, as well as through distributors, resellers, and manufacturers' representatives.

Hydraulics

The Hydraulics segment is a global leader in hydraulics components, systems and services for industrial and mobile equipment. Eaton offers a wide range of power products including pumps, motors and hydraulic power units; a broad range of controls and sensing products including valves, cylinders and electronic controls; a full range of fluid conveyance products including industrial and hydraulic hose, fittings, and assemblies, thermoplastic hose and tubing, couplings, connectors, and assembly equipment; filtration systems solutions; industrial drum and disc brakes; and golf grips. The principal markets for the Hydraulics segment include renewable energy, marine, agriculture, oil and gas, construction, mining, forestry, utility, material handling, truck and bus, machine tools, molding, primary metals, and power generation. Key manufacturing customers in these markets and other customers are located globally. Products are sold and serviced through a variety of channels.

Other Information

No single customer represented greater than 10% of net sales in


,


or


, respectively.

The accounting policies of the business segments are generally the same as the policies described in Note 1, except that inventory and related cost of products sold of the segments are accounted for using the FIFO method and operating profit only reflects the service cost component related to pensions and other postretirement benefits. Intersegment sales and transfers are accounted for at the same prices as if the sales and transfers were made to third parties. These intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation. Operating profit includes the operating profit from intersegment sales.



For purposes of business segment performance measurement, the Company does not allocate items that are of a non-operating nature or are of a corporate or functional governance nature. Corporate expenses consist of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of certain businesses and corporate office expenses including compensation, benefits, occupancy, depreciation, and other administrative costs. Identifiable assets of the business segments exclude goodwill, other intangible assets, and general corporate assets, which principally consist of certain cash, short-term investments, deferred income taxes, certain accounts receivable, certain property, plant and equipment, and certain other assets.

Business Segment Information

Business segment operating profit was reduced by acquisition integration charges as follows:

Corporate acquisition integration charges totaled

$5

and

$25

in


and


, respectively, and are included above in Other corporate expense - net. There was no corporate acquisition integration charges in

Note 16.

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On November 14, 2013, Eaton Corporation registered senior notes under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Senior Notes). Eaton and certain other of Eaton's 100% owned direct and indirect subsidiaries (the Guarantors) fully and unconditionally guaranteed (subject, in the case of the Guarantors, other than Eaton, to customary release provisions as described below), on a joint and several basis, the Senior Notes. The following condensed consolidating financial statements are included so that separate financial statements of Eaton, Eaton Corporation and each of the Guarantors are not required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The consolidating adjustments primarily relate to eliminations of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions. The condensed consolidating financial statements present investments in subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting. See Note 6 for additional information related to the Senior Notes.

The guarantee of a Guarantor that is not a parent of the issuer will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged in the event of any sale of the Guarantor or of all or substantially all of its assets, or in connection with the release or termination of the Guarantor as a guarantor under all other U.S. debt securities or U.S. syndicated credit facilities, subject to limitations set forth in the indenture. The guarantee of a Guarantor that is a direct or indirect parent of the issuer will only be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged in connection with the release or termination of such Guarantor as a guarantor under all other debt securities or syndicated credit facilities (in both cases, U.S. or otherwise), subject to limitations set forth in the indenture.

During 2016 and 2015, the Company undertook certain steps to restructure ownership of various subsidiaries. The transactions were entirely among wholly-owned subsidiaries under the common control of Eaton. This restructuring has been reflected as of the beginning of the earliest period presented below.



















MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Amounts are in millions of dollars or shares unless indicated otherwise (per share data assume dilution).

COMPANY OVERVIEW

Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton or the Company) is a power management company with


net sales of

$19.7 billion

. The Company provides energy-efficient solutions that help its customers effectively manage electrical, hydraulic and mechanical power more efficiently, safely and sustainably. Eaton has approximately

95,000

employees in

over 60

countries and sells products to customers in more than


countries.

Summary of Results of Operations

During


and


, the Company's results of operations were impacted by decline in several of the Company's end markets. Further, the results of operations were negatively impacted by the strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar. Despite the declining market conditions and unfavorable impact of currency translation, the Company generated solid operating margins and net income per share - diluted.

During 2015, Eaton announced a multi-year restructuring initiative to reduce its cost structure and gain efficiencies in all business segments and at corporate in order to respond to declining market conditions. Restructuring charges in


and


were

$211

and

$129

, respectively. These charges were primarily comprised of severance costs. Restructuring charges are anticipated to be

$100

in 2017. The projected annualized savings from these restructuring actions are expected to be

$518

, when fully realized in 2018.

During 2014, the Company's results of operations were impacted by modest growth in the Company's end markets, particularly in North America. This was partially offset by the impact of settlement of two litigation matters with ZF Meritor LLC and Meritor Transmission Corporation (collectively, Meritor) and Triumph Actuation Systems, LLC and other claimants (collectively, Triumph) for $500 and $147.5, respectively, and the sale of the Aerospace Power Distribution Management Solutions and Integrated Cockpit Solutions businesses to Safran for

$270

, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of

$154

. Also, during the second half of 2014 the Company's results of operations were negatively impacted by shifts in currency exchange rates. Despite the modest growth and negative currency exchange rates, the Company generated net income per share - diluted in 2014 that was broadly in line with the Company's guidance at the start of the year after excluding the litigation settlements and the gain on the sale of the Aerospace businesses.

Additional information related to business acquisitions and sales, restructuring activities and the litigation settlements is presented in Note 2, Note 3, Note 4 and Note 8, respectively, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

A summary of Eaton’s Net sales, Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders, and Net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders - diluted follows:

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following discussion of Consolidated Financial Results and Business Segment Results of Operations includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include operating earnings, operating earnings per ordinary share, and operating profit before acquisition integration charges for each business segment as well as corporate, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of operating earnings and operating earnings per ordinary share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the table below. Operating profit before acquisition integration charges is reconciled in the discussion of the operating results of each business segment, and excludes acquisition integration expense related to integration of Ephesus Lighting, Inc. and Oxalis Group Ltd. in 2016 and primarily Cooper Industries plc in 2015 and 2014. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they exclude certain transactions, allowing investors to more easily compare Eaton’s financial performance period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton and each business segment. For additional information on acquisition integration charges, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

7.7%

). The 2016 effective tax rate increased from 2015 primarily due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by net decreases in worldwide tax liabilities.

During 2015, an income tax expense of

$164

was recognized (an effective tax rate of

7.7%

) compared to income tax benefit of

$42

for 2014 (an effective tax benefit rate of

2.4%

). In 2014, excluding the net tax benefit of 7.6% for the Meritor and Triumph litigation settlements and related legal costs and the gain on the sale of the Aerospace businesses, the effective tax rate was 5.2%. The 2015 effective tax rate increased from 2014 primarily due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions and net increases in worldwide tax liabilities.



Net Income

Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders of

$1,979

in


increased

10%

compared to Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders of

$1,793

in


. The increase in


was primarily due to lower income in the second quarter of 2014 as a result of settlement of the Meritor and Triumph litigation matters for

$500

and

$147.5

, respectively, partially offset by the impact of the sale of the Aerospace Power Distribution Management Solutions and Integrated Cockpit Solutions businesses. Excluding litigation settlements and gain on sale, net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders declined in 2015 due to lower sales volume, the negative impact of currency translation, a higher tax rate, and higher restructuring charges incurred in 2015, offset by savings resulting from the 2015 restructuring actions and other cost control measures.

Operating Earnings

Operating earnings of

$1,925

in


decreased

4%

compared to Operating earnings of

$2,010

in

on the divestiture of Eaton's Aerospace Power Distribution Management Solutions and Integrated Cockpit Solutions businesses during the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the litigation settlement and gain on the divestiture of the business, total corporate expenses-net decreased 7% in 2015 due to savings from cost control measures.



LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION

Financial Condition and Liquidity

Eaton’s objective is to finance its business through operating cash flow and an appropriate mix of equity and long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying its debt maturity structure, Eaton reduces liquidity risk. The Company maintains access to the commercial paper markets through a

$2,000

commercial paper program. On October 14, 2016, Eaton refinanced a $750, five-year revolving credit facility with a $750, five-year revolving credit facility that will expire October 14, 2021. Eaton also maintains a $500, four-year revolving credit facility that will expire on October 3, 2018 and a $750, five-year credit facility that will expire October 3, 2019. This refinancing maintains long-term revolving credit facilities at a total of $2,000. The revolving credit facilities are used to support commercial paper borrowings and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis. There were no borrowings outstanding under Eaton's revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2016 or 2015. The Company had available lines of credit of

$823

from various banks primarily for the issuance of letters of credit, of which there was

$285

outstanding at

December 31, 2016

. Over the course of a year, cash, short-term investments and short-term debt may fluctuate in order to manage global liquidity. Eaton believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, cash and short-term investment balances, and access to capital markets in excess of the liquidity necessary to meet future operating needs of the business as well as scheduled payments of long-term debt.

On September 20, 2016, a subsidiary of Eaton issued Euro denominated notes (Euro Notes) with a face value of

€550

(

$615

based on the September 20, 2016 spot rate), in accordance with Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Euro Notes mature in 2024 with interest payable annually at a rate of

0.75%

. After financing costs and discounts, the issuer received proceeds totaling

€544

(

$609

based on the September 20, 2016 spot rate) from the issuance.

For additional information on financing transactions and debt, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Eaton’s credit facilities and indentures governing certain long-term debt contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit facilities for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. At Eaton’s present credit rating level, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of secured debt (or lease payments due under a sale and leaseback transaction) to adjusted consolidated net worth (or consolidated net tangible assets, in each case as defined in the relevant credit agreement or indenture) may not exceed 10%. Eaton's actual ratios are substantially below the required threshold. In addition, Eaton is in compliance with each of its debt covenants for all periods presented.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Operating Cash Flow

Net cash provided by operating activities was

$2,552

in


, an increase of

$181

compared to

$2,371

in


. The increase was driven by lower pension contributions and lower working capital balances compared to 2015.

Net cash provided by operating activities was

$2,371

Credit Ratings

Eaton's debt has been assigned the following credit ratings:

Defined Benefits Plans

Pension Plans

During


, the fair value of plan assets in the Company’s employee pension plans increased

$41

to

$4,447

at

December 31, 2016

. The increase in plan assets was primarily due to better than expected return on plan assets and the Company's contributions to the pension plans, partially offset by the impact of negative currency translation. At

December 31, 2016

, the net unfunded position of

$1,638

in pension liabilities consisted of $665 in the U.S. qualified pension plans, $850 in plans that have no minimum funding requirements, and $190 in all other plans that require minimum funding, partially offset by $67 in plans that are overfunded.

Funding requirements are a major consideration in making contributions to Eaton’s pension plans. With respect to the Company’s pension plans worldwide, the Company intends to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable law and regulations. In


,

$262

was contributed to the pension plans. The Company contributed $100 to U.S. qualified pension plans in early 2017 and anticipates making an additional $115 of contributions to certain pension plans during 2017. The funded status of the Company’s pension plans at the end of


, and future contributions, will depend primarily on the actual return on assets during the year and the discount rate used to calculate certain benefits at the end of the year. Depending on these factors, and the resulting funded status of the pension plans, the level of future contributions could be materially higher or lower than in


.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Eaton does not have off-balance sheet arrangements or financings with unconsolidated entities or other persons. In the ordinary course of business, the Company leases certain real properties and equipment, as described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may involve the exercise of significant judgment. For any estimate or assumption used, there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that could have been used. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other such estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Sales of products are recognized when a sales agreement is in place, products have been shipped to unaffiliated customers and title has transferred in accordance with shipping terms, the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, all significant related acts of performance have been completed, and no other significant uncertainties exist. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in Net sales and the related costs in Cost of products sold. Although the majority of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes, and, if so, how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element. For delivered elements, sales generally are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided.



Eaton records reductions to revenue for customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates, at the time of the initial sale. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets Eaton serves, but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is equivalent to Eaton's operating segments and based on the net assets for each segment, including goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill is assigned to each operating segment, as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results. The Company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis.

Additionally, goodwill is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events, specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price.

Goodwill impairment testing for


was performed using a quantitative analysis under which the fair value for each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model, which considered forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted-average cost of capital. The forecasted cash flows were based on the Company's long-term operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the operating segment's cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values.

Goodwill impairment testing for


and


was performed using a qualitative analysis, which is performed by assessing certain trends and factors that require significant judgment, including projected market outlook and growth rates, forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins, discount rates, industry data, and other relevant qualitative factors. These trends and factors are compared to, and based on, the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative assessment. The results of these qualitative analyses did not indicate a need to perform a quantitative analysis.

Based on a quantitative analysis performed in


and qualitative analyses performed in


and


, the fair values of Eaton's reporting units continue to substantially exceed the respective carrying amounts.

Indefinite Life Intangible Assets

Indefinite life intangible assets consist of certain trademarks. They are evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis to determine whether their fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts. Indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing for


and


was performed using a quantitative analysis. Determining the fair value of these assets requires significant judgment and the Company uses a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired, but using updated estimates of future sales, cash flows and profitability.

Additionally, indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include changes in industry and market considerations, cost factors, financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events that could affect inputs used to determine the respective fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets.

For


and


, the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying value.



Other Long-Lived Assets

Other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include operations reporting losses, a significant adverse change in the use of an asset, the planned disposal or sale of the asset, a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors related to the asset, or a significant decrease in the estimated market value of an asset. Upon indications of impairment, assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value. In instances where the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded the undiscounted cash flows, the fair value of the asset group would be determined and an impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgment.

For additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recoverability of Deferred Income Tax Assets

Eaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In order to determine the income tax provision for financial statement purposes, Eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions. These estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards.

Management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which it operates. If the Company experiences cumulative pretax income in a particular jurisdiction in a three-year period including the current and prior two years, management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized, unless known or planned operating developments would lead management to conclude otherwise. However, if the Company experiences cumulative pretax losses in a particular jurisdiction in a three-year period including the current and prior two years, management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized. These factors include historical operating results, known or planned operating developments, the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse, consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities, tax law carryback capability in a particular country, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as the Company’s goodwill and other impairment testing. After evaluation of these factors, if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country, management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required. To the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction, management would establish a valuation allowance. For additional information about income taxes, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans

The measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans is based on assumptions related to future events including interest rates, return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Actual plan asset performance will either reduce or increase losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which ultimately affects net income.

The discount rate for United States plans was determined by discounting the expected future benefit payments using a theoretical zero-coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high-quality bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single rate that generated the same benefit obligation. Only corporate bonds with a rating of Aa or higher by either Moody’s or Standard & Poor's were included. Callable bonds and certain other non-comparable bonds were eliminated. Finally, a subset of bonds was selected by grouping the universe of bonds by duration and retaining 50% of the bonds that had the highest yields.

The discount rates for non-United States plans were determined by region and are based on high quality long-term corporate and government bonds. Consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate.



In 2016, the Company adopted a change in the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Prior to 2016, for the vast majority of its plans, the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, the Company used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows in the estimation of the service and interest components of benefit cost, resulting in a more precise measurement. This change does not affect the measurement of total benefit obligations. The change was accounted for as a change in estimate and, accordingly, was accounted for prospectively starting in 2016. The reductions in service cost and interest cost for 2016 associated with this change in estimate were

$3

and

$42

, respectively.

Key assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefits expense are adjusted at each year-end. A 1-percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets is estimated to have approximately a $43 effect on pension expense. Likewise, a 1-percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a $70 effect on pension expense. A 1-percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on other postretirement benefits assets is estimated to have approximately a $1 effect on other postretirement benefits expense. A 1-percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a $3 effect on expense for other postretirement benefits plans.

Additional information related to changes in key assumptions used to recognize expense for other postretirement benefits plans is found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Contingencies

As a result of past operations, Eaton is involved in remedial response and voluntary environmental remediation at a number of sites, including certain of its currently-owned or formerly-owned plants. The Company has also been named a potentially responsible party under the United States federal Superfund law, or the state equivalents thereof, at a number of disposal sites.

A number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation, including the number of parties involved at a particular site, the determination of the extent of contamination, the length of time the remediation may require, the complexity of environmental regulations, and the continuing advancement of remediation technology. Taking these factors into account, Eaton has estimated the costs of remediation, which will be paid over a period of years. The Company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis, consistent with the estimates of these costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred. At

December 31, 2016

and


,

$124

and

$131

, respectively, was accrued for these costs.

Based upon Eaton's analysis and subject to the difficulty in estimating these future costs, the Company expects that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters is not reasonably possible to exceed the recorded liability by an amount that would have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE

On a regular basis, Eaton monitors third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and short-term investments, primarily for safety of principal and secondarily for maximizing yield on those funds. The Company diversifies its cash and short-term investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Eaton also monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and suppliers to mitigate any adverse impact.

Eaton uses derivative instruments to manage exposure to volatility in raw material costs, currency, and interest rates on certain debt instruments. Derivative financial instruments used by the Company are straightforward and non-leveraged. The counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings. Eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instruments.

Eaton’s ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is based on the strength of its credit rating and overall market conditions. The Company has not experienced any material limitations in its ability to access these sources of liquidity. At

December 31, 2016

, Eaton had

$2,000

of long-term revolving credit facilities with banks in support of its commercial paper program. It has no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.

Interest rate risk can be measured by calculating the short-term earnings impact that would result from adverse changes in interest rates. This exposure results from short-term debt, which includes commercial paper at a floating interest rate, long-term debt that has been swapped to floating rates, and money market investments that have not been swapped to fixed rates. Based upon the balances of investments and floating rate debt at year end


, a 100 basis-point increase in short-term interest rates would have increased the Company’s net, pretax interest expense by $36.



Eaton also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of the Company’s financial liabilities would change as a result of movements in interest rates. Based on Eaton’s best estimate for a hypothetical, 100 basis point decrease in interest rates at

December 31, 2016

, the market value of the Company’s debt and interest rate swap portfolio, in aggregate, would increase by $435.

The Company is exposed to currency risk associated with translating its functional currency financial statements into its reporting currency, which is the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. Eaton also monitors exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each country in which the Company operates, and regularly enters into forward contracts to mitigate that exposure. In the aggregate, Eaton’s portfolio of forward contracts related to such transactions was not material to its Consolidated Financial Statements.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

A summary of contractual obligations as of

December 31, 2016

follows:

Interest expense related to long-term debt is based on the fixed interest rate, or other applicable interest rate, related to the debt instrument. The reduction of interest expense due to interest rate swap agreements related to long-term debt is based on the difference in the fixed interest rate the Company receives from the swap, compared to the floating interest rate the Company pays on the swap. Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business. These amounts include commitments for purchases of raw materials, outstanding non-cancelable purchase orders, releases under blanket purchase orders, and commitments under ongoing service arrangements. Other long-term obligations principally include anticipated contributions of

$215

to pension plans in


and $58 of deferred compensation earned under various plans for which the participants have elected to receive disbursement at a later date.

The table above does not include future expected pension benefit payments or expected other postretirement benefits payments. Information related to the amounts of these future payments is described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table above also excludes the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits, since the Company cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. At

December 31, 2016

, the gross liability for unrecognized income tax benefits totaled

$629

and interest and penalties were

$94

.
