GENERAL

Newell Rubbermaid is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that touch the lives of
people where they work, live and play. The Company’s strong portfolio of brands includes Sharpie

®

,
Paper Mate

®

, Dymo

®

, Expo

®

, Waterman

®

, Parker

®

, Rolodex

®

, Irwin

, Lenox

®

, BernzOmatic

®

, Rubbermaid

®

,

and Goody

®

. The Company’s multi-product offering consists of well
known name-brand consumer and commercial products in four business segments: Cleaning,
Organization & Décor; Office Products; Tools & Hardware; and Home & Family.

The Company’s vision is to become a global company of consumer-meaningful brands (“Brands That
Matter™”) and great people, known for best-in-class results. The Company’s four transformational
strategic initiatives are as follows: Create Consumer-Meaningful Brands, Leverage One Newell
Rubbermaid, Achieve Best Total Cost and Nurture 360º Innovation.

Create Consumer-Meaningful Brands is the initiative to move from a historical focus on customer
push marketing and excelling in manufacturing and distributing products, to a new focus on consumer
pull marketing and creating competitive advantage through understanding the Company’s consumers,
innovating to deliver great performance and value, investing in advertising and promotion to create
demand and leveraging its brands in adjacent categories around the world. Leverage One Newell
Rubbermaid is the initiative to lower costs and drive speed to market by leveraging common business
activities and best practices of its business units. This will be supported by building a common
culture of shared values, with a focus on collaboration and teamwork. Achieve Best Total Cost is
the initiative to achieve an optimal balance between manufacturing and sourcing and between
high-cost and low-cost manufacturing and to leverage the Company’s size and scale to drive
productivity and achieve a best cost position. Nurture 360º Innovation represents the broadened
definition of innovation to include consumer driven product invention and the successful
commercialization of invention.

The Company’s results depend on the ability of its individual business units to succeed in their
respective categories, each of which has some unique consumers, customers and competitors. The
Company’s strategic initiatives are designed to enable these business units to generate
differentiated products, operate within a best-in-class cost structure and employ superior branding
in order to realize premium margins on their products. Premium margins, in turn, fund incremental
demand creation by the business units, driving incremental sales and profits for the Company.

Refer to the forward-looking statements section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the Company’s forward-looking
statements included in this report.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The Company’s four business segments reflect the Company’s focus on building large consumer and
commercial brands, promoting organizational integration, achieving operating efficiencies in
sourcing and distribution, and leveraging its understanding of similar consumer segments and
distribution channels.



The Company’s business segments are as follows:

chain and other resources on a global basis. The establishment of a
GBU structure did not impact the Company’s operating  business

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Create Consumer-Meaningful Brands

The Company is continuing to move from its historical focus on customer push marketing and
excelling in manufacturing and distributing products, to a new focus on consumer pull marketing and
creating competitive advantage through better understanding its consumers, innovating to deliver
great performance and value, investing in advertising and promotion to create demand and leveraging
its brands in adjacent categories around the world. Consumer-meaningful brands create more value
than products alone, and big brands provide the Company with the economies of scale that can be
leveraged in today’s marketplace.

In 2007, the Company made incremental investments in strategic brand building for several brands
including Sharpie

®

, Paper Mate

®

, Rubbermaid

®

, Graco

®

, Calphalon

®

and Goody

®

. In just two years,
the Company has increased its investment in strategic brand building almost 60% to 6.2% of sales.
The Company is committed to increasing selective television, print, direct mail and online
advertising, and using sampling and product demonstrations where appropriate, to increase brand
awareness and trials among end-users of its brands. During 2007, the Company sponsored the #26
Irwin

®

car in the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series, the Sharpie

®

500 NASCAR race in Bristol, Tennessee and
the Lenox

®

Industrial Tools 300 NASCAR race in Loudon, New Hampshire. In 2008, the Company
anticipates focusing its advertising and sponsorships in similar areas.

The
Company continues to employ resources to create best-in-class branding capabilities across the Company. As part of the
Company’s Marketing Build and Transform initiative, it has created a detailed blueprint and roadmap
for achieving brand building excellence over time, complete with annual targets and measures. The
Company has added top executive talent from some of the world’s leading consumer products companies
to its management ranks as well as developed and launched a comprehensive series of Marketing
Excellence training programs, covering both basic and advanced curriculums to expand and develop
consumer marketing capabilities and further enhance consumer understanding. The Company’s brand building
initiatives and the increased investments in research, training, and
consumer-noticeable spending activities have contributed to the Company realizing
market share gains in certain key brands, notably in the Calphalon, Goody, Dymo and Rubbermaid
Commercial Products businesses, and global growth in the Irwin and Lenox branded tools businesses.

Leverage One Newell Rubbermaid

The Company is committed to leveraging the common business activities and best practices of its
business units, and to build one common culture of shared values, with a focus on collaboration and
teamwork. Through this initiative, the Company strives to benefit from the reduction of costs
achieved through horizontal integration and economies of scale. For example, the Company continues
to explore ways to leverage its common functional capabilities such as Human Resources, Information
Technology, Customer Service, Supply Chain Management and Finance to improve efficiency and reduce
costs. The Company is also taking significant steps toward achieving low cost logistical
excellence, including the centralization and consolidation of the Company’s distribution and
transportation activities. The centralization of these functions will increase buying power across
the Company.

Additionally, certain administrative functions are centralized at the corporate level including
cash management, accounting systems, capital expenditure approvals, restructuring approvals, order
processing, billing, credit, accounts receivable collections, data processing operations and legal
functions. Centralization concentrates technical expertise in one location, making it easier to
communicate, observe overall business trends and manage the Company’s businesses.

The Company previously accelerated the process of creating shared services for the European
businesses and is expanding the scope of shared services in the U.S
and Latin America. The transition of services to
the Shared Service Center in Europe is approximately 90% complete. In addition, in its move to a
consistent GBU structure, the Company has recently created and expanded leadership positions to
identify and drive synergies across business units.

On October 1, 2007, the Company’s Office Products segment successfully went live with the SAP
implementation for its North American operations. This SAP go-live marks the completion of the
first major milestone in a multi-year rollout aimed at migrating multiple legacy systems and users
to a common SAP global information platform.

- 5 -


This will enable the Company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting processes
more efficiently.

Achieve Best Total Cost

The Company’s objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing, sourcing and supplying product on
an ongoing basis, and to leverage the Company’s size and scale, in order to achieve a best total
cost position in relevant product categories. Achieving best cost positions in its categories
allows the Company to increase investment in strategic brand building initiatives. To improve
productivity, the Company focuses on reducing procurement, material handling and distribution and
transportation costs; driving manufacturing efficiencies; and removing excess overhead costs to
reduce the overall cost of manufacturing and delivering products. The Company has also shifted a
portion of its research and development efforts to focus on ways to design future products that can
be manufactured more cost effectively.

A key component of this strategy is the Company’s sourcing transformation — restructuring the
manufacturing and sourcing footprint to reduce total delivered cost, including increasing capacity
utilization and the percentage of manufacturing located in lower-cost countries as well as
achieving a balance of company-owned manufacturing and third party sourcing partners. Project
Acceleration remains on track to deliver its commitments in cost, savings and timing over the life
of the project, and the Company has realized savings in its operating results. Project Acceleration
is projected to result in cumulative restructuring costs of approximately $375 million to $400
million ($315 million to $340 million after tax). Approximately 67% of the costs are expected to
be cash. Annualized savings from Project Acceleration are expected to exceed $150 million upon
conclusion of the project in 2009, with $60 million in annual savings recognized in 2007 and
additional benefits of $60 million and $30 million projected for 2008 and 2009, respectively. To
date, the Company has announced approximately two-thirds of its anticipated closings and
consolidations and has announced the expansion of the program to include certain scale leveraging
initiatives with respect to distribution, transportation and shared services.

The Company is also committed to reducing non-strategic selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”) costs throughout the organization. The Company is vigilant in creating a leaner
organization that is more flexible in its response time, both internally and externally. The
Company’s efforts to Leverage One Newell Rubbermaid through horizontal integration will help the
Company to achieve this goal.

Nurture 360º Innovation

The Company has broadened its definition of innovation beyond product invention. The Company
defines innovation as the successful commercialization of invention. It is a rigorous,
consumer-centric process that permeates the entire development cycle. It begins with a deep
understanding of how consumers interact with the Company’s brands and categories, and all the
factors that drive their purchase decisions and in-use experience. That understanding must then be
translated into innovative products that deliver unique features and benefits, at a best-cost
position, providing the consumer with great value. Lastly, innovating how and where to create
awareness and trial use, and measuring the effectiveness of advertising and promotion spending,
completes the process. The Company has pockets of excellence using this expanded definition of
innovation and continues to build on this competency in its effort to create consumer-meaningful
brands. Since the beginning of 2007, the Company launched a number of innovative new products
including the
Sharpie

®

Chisel Tip,
Levolor

®

Roman Shades, Lenox

®

Diamond™ saw blades, Graco

®

iMonitor™, and the Rubbermaid

®

Premier line of premium food storage
containers. Additionally, the Company’s Baby and Parenting Essentials business launched the Graco
Sweetpeace-Newborn Soothing Center in early 2008. This product reinvents the swing category by
offering babies a multi-sensory experience that mimics the actual movements mothers use to soothe
their infants and comes programmed with comforting prenatal sounds, such as a heartbeat, that
research has proven to be especially comforting to babies. The Company is investing in a targeted
multimedia print and web marketing campaign to support the launch of this innovative new product.

GROWTH STRATEGY

The
Company’s growth strategy includes internal growth and acquisitions. The Company is also
increasingly focused on globalization and the significant
opportunities to further expand internationally.

Internal Growth

The Company focuses on internal growth principally by understanding consumers, demand creation
through marketing, commercializing innovative new products, entering new domestic and international
markets, adding new customers, cross-selling existing product lines to current customers and
supporting its U.S.-based customers’ international expansion. Internal growth is generally defined
by the Company as growth from continuing businesses owned more than one year.

Acquisition Strategy

The Company supplements internal growth by selectively acquiring businesses with prominent end-user
focused brands and improving the profitability of such businesses through the implementation of the
Company’s strategic initiatives. Strategic criteria for an acquisition include: the existence of
consumer-meaningful brands that reflect differentiation and innovation, global categories,
favorable customer and channel dynamics, strong margin and growth potential, focus on non-cyclical,
semi-durable products, and synergies with our core categories and competencies.

Globalization

The Company is expanding from a U.S.-centric business model to one that includes international
growth as an increasing focus. The growth of consumer goods economies and retail structures in
several regions outside the U.S., particularly Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, Mexico and South America,
makes them attractive to the Company by providing selective opportunities to acquire businesses,
develop partnerships with new foreign customers and extend relationships with the Company’s
domestic customers whose businesses are growing internationally. As a result, the Company pursues
selective international opportunities to further its internal growth and acquisition objectives.
The Company’s sales outside the U.S. approximated 28%, 26% and 24% of total sales in 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

The Company has made significant strides in structuring itself for successful globalization. In
2007, the Company realigned its businesses under a GBU structure. This realignment positions the
businesses to leverage research and development, branding, marketing and innovation on a global
basis. The Company has also implemented the process of creating shared services for the European
businesses, which is approximately 90% complete. Finally, the Company is in the early stages of
migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common SAP global information platform, which will
enable the Company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting processes more
efficiently.

DIVESTITURE AND PRODUCT LINE RATIONALIZATION

The Company consistently reviews its businesses and product offerings, assesses their strategic fit
and seeks opportunities to divest non-strategic businesses. The criteria used by the Company in
assessing the strategic fit include: the existence of consumer-meaningful brands that respond to
differentiation and innovation, global categories, favorable customer and channel dynamics, strong
margin and growth potential, focus on non-cyclical, semi-durable products, synergies with our core
categories and competencies, and the business’ actual and potential impact on the operating
performance of the Company. While the Company believes that the business units remaining in our
portfolio constitute core businesses, the Company will continue to review its businesses and
product offerings and assess their strategic fit.

During 2006 and early 2007, the Company divested its European Cookware, Little Tikes and Home Décor
Europe businesses. During 2005, the Company divested its Curver business. See Footnote 3 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of discontinued operations.

- 7 -


In the normal course of business, the Company rationalizes low margin products. The Company’s
decision to exit these low margin product lines is consistent with its strategy to focus on high
margin, high potential opportunities that support the Company’s financial objectives.

OTHER INFORMATION

Multi-Product Offering

The Company’s broad product coverage in multiple categories permits it to more effectively meet the
needs of its customers. With families of leading brand names and profitable and innovative new
products, the Company can also assist volume purchasers sell a more profitable product mix. As a
potential single source for an entire product line, the Company can use program merchandising to
improve product presentation, optimize display space for both sales and income and encourage
impulse buying by retail customers.

Customer Marketing and Service

The Company strives to develop long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships with its customers and
become their supplier and brand of choice. To achieve this goal, the Company has a value-added
marketing program that offers a family of leading brand name staple products, tailored sales
programs, innovative merchandising support, in-store services and responsive top management.

The Company strives to enhance its relationships with customers through exceptional customer
service. The Company’s ability to provide superior customer service is a result of its information
technology, marketing and merchandising programs that are designed to enhance the sales and
profitability of its customers and provide consistent on-time delivery of its products.

A critical element of the Company’s customer service is consistent on-time delivery of products to
its customers. Retailers are pursuing a number of strategies to deliver the highest-quality,
best-cost products to their customers. Retailers now frequently purchase on a “just-in-time” basis
in order to reduce inventory carrying costs and increase returns on investment. As retailers
shorten their lead times for orders, manufacturers need to more closely anticipate consumer-buying
patterns. The Company supports its retail customers’ “just-in-time” inventory strategies through
more responsive sourcing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities and electronic
communications.

Foreign Operations

Information regarding the Company’s 2007, 2006 and 2005 foreign operations and financial
information by geographic area is included in Footnote 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. Information regarding risks relating to the
Company’s foreign operations is set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this report and is incorporated by
reference herein.

Raw Materials

The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its
material requirements. The raw materials and various purchased components required for its
products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. The Company’s product offerings
require the purchase of resin, glass, corrugate and metals, including steel, stainless steel, zinc,
aluminum and gold. The Company has experienced inflation in raw material prices and expects such
inflation pressures to continue in 2008. The Company continues to attempt to reduce the volume of
its resin purchases through product line rationalization and strategic divestitures. See
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further
discussion.

Backlog

The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.

Seasonal Variations

The Company’s sales and operating income in the first quarter are generally lower than any other
quarter during the year, driven principally by reduced demand and
volume for the products in the Company’s Office Products and
Cleaning,  Organization & D

é

cor segments in the
quarter.

Customers / Competition

The Company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home
centers, warehouse clubs and office superstores, and commercial distributors. The rapid growth of
these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have
contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and the
formation of dominant multi-category retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers.
This environment limits the Company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices.

Current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers,
demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and
deliver products with shorter lead times. Other trends, in the absence of a strong new product
development effort or strong end-user brands, are for the retailer to import generic products
directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products, under their own private label
brands, that compete with products of the Company. The combination of these market influences has
created an intensely competitive environment in which the Company’s principal customers
continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in pricing pressures and the need
for strong end-user brands, the ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing
improvements in category management and customer service. The Company competes with numerous
manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, many of which are large and well established.

The Company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining
consumer-meaningful brands and differentiated products, delivering superior customer service
(including innovative “good-better-best” marketing and merchandising programs), consistent on-time
delivery, outsourcing certain production to low cost suppliers and lower cost countries where
appropriate and experienced management.

The Company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail
environment by developing strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company
markets its strong multi-product offering through virtually every category of high-volume retailer,
including discount, drug, grocery and variety chains, warehouse clubs, department, hardware and
specialty stores, home centers, office superstores, contract stationers and military exchanges.
The Company’s largest customer, Wal*Mart (which includes Sam’s Club), accounted for approximately
13% of net sales in 2007, across substantially all business units. The Company’s top ten customers
included (

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The factors that are discussed below, as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this
report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could materially and
adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail economies in
various parts of the world.

The Company’s business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the
world, primarily in North America and to a lesser extent Europe, Central and South America and
Asia. These retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the
condition of the retail industry, which, in turn, are affected by general economic conditions and
specific events such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks and political unrest. The impact of
these external factors is difficult to predict, and one or more of the factors could adversely
impact our business. In recent years, the retail industry in the U.S. and, increasingly, elsewhere
has been characterized by intense competition among retailers. Because such competition,
particularly in weak retail economies, can cause retailers to struggle or fail, the Company must
continuously monitor, and adapt to changes in, the profitability, creditworthiness and pricing
policies of its customers.

The Company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers.

The Company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial
products, many of which are large and well established. The Company’s principal customers are
large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs and office
superstores, and commercial distributors. The rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers,
together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to the formation of dominant
multi-category retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Current trends among
retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding innovative new
products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and delivering products with
shorter lead times. Other trends are for retailers to import products directly from foreign
sources and to source and sell products, under their own private label brands, that compete with
the Company’s products.

The combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in
which the Company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use,
resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big, consumer-meaningful brands, the
ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products, continuing improvements in
customer service, and the maintenance of strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers.
The Company also faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major retailer
customers, such as overall store and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation. The
resulting risks to the Company include possible loss of sales, reduced profitability and limited
ability to recover cost increases through price increases.

To compete successfully, the Company must develop and commercialize a continuing stream of
innovative new products that create consumer demand.

The Company’s long-term success in the competitive retail environment depends on its ability to
develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer
demand. The Company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new
products that compete with the Company’s products. The Company’s strategy includes increased
investment in new product development and increased focus on innovation. There are, nevertheless,
numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and commercializing innovative new
products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not deliver expected growth in sales
or operating income.

To compete successfully, the Company must develop and maintain big, consumer-meaningful brands.

The Company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop
and maintain consumer-meaningful brands so that the Company’s retailer customers will need the
Company’s products to meet consumer demand. Consumer-meaningful brands allow the Company to
realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands
requires significant investment in brand building and marketing initiatives. While the Company is
substantially increasing its expenditures for advertising and other brand building and marketing
initiatives, the increased investment may not deliver the anticipated results.

- 10 -


Price increases in raw materials could harm the Company’s financial results.

The Company purchases some raw materials, including resin, glass, corrugate, steel, gold, zinc,
brass and aluminum, which are subject to price volatility and inflationary pressures. The Company
attempts to reduce its exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs,
including periodic purchases, future delivery purchases, long-term contracts and sales price
adjustments. Where practical, the Company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process.
Raw material price increases may more than offset productivity gains and could materially impact
the Company’s financial results.

The Company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve productivity and streamline
operations.

The Company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing
efficiencies, reduce supply chain costs and streamline non-strategic selling, general and
administrative expenses in order to produce products at a best-cost position and allow the Company
to invest in innovation and brand building. Project Acceleration includes the closure of
approximately one-third of the Company’s 64 manufacturing facilities (adjusted for the divestiture
of Little Tikes and Home Décor Europe). In addition, the Company continuously explores ways to
best leverage its functional capabilities such as Human Resources, Information Technology, Customer
Service, Supply Chain Management and Finance in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The
Company runs the risk that Project Acceleration and other corporate initiatives aimed at
streamlining operations and processes and cost reduction may not be completed substantially as
planned, may be more costly to implement than expected, or may not have the positive effects
anticipated, or that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required after such
projects are completed. In addition, disruptions in the Company’s ability to supply products on a
timely basis, which may be incidental to any problems in the execution of Project Acceleration,
could adversely affect the Company’s future results.

The Company’s ability to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses is an
important factor in the Company’s future growth.

Although the Company has in recent years increasingly emphasized internal growth rather than growth
by acquisition, the Company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate
the acquired businesses successfully, including obtaining anticipated cost savings and operating
income improvements within a reasonable period of time, remain important factors in the Company’s
future growth. Furthermore, the cost of any future major acquisitions could constrain the
Company’s access to capital and increase the Company’s borrowing costs.

The Company is subject to risks related to its international operations and sourcing model.

Foreign operations, especially in Europe, but also in Asia, Central and South America and Canada,
are important to the Company’s business. The Company is expanding from a U.S.-centric business
model to one that includes international growth as an increasing focus. In addition, as the
Company increasingly sources products in low-cost countries, particularly in the Far East, it is
exposed to additional risks and uncertainties. Foreign operations can be affected by factors such
as currency devaluation, other currency fluctuations, tariffs, nationalization, exchange controls,
interest rates, limitations on foreign investment in local business and other political, economic
and regulatory risks and difficulties. The Company also faces risks due to the transportation and
logistical complexities inherent in increased reliance on foreign sourcing.

The Company faces challenges and uncertainties as it transforms into a company that grows through
consumer-meaningful brands and new product innovation.

The Company is undergoing a transformation from a portfolio-holding company that grew through
acquisitions to a focused group of leadership platforms that generate internal growth driven by
consumer-meaningful brands and new product innovation. Such a transformation will require
significant investment in brand-building, marketing and product development and the development of
the right methods for understanding how consumers interact with the Company’s brands and categories
and measuring the effectiveness of advertising and promotion spending. Although the process is
well underway, significant challenges and uncertainties remain.

Complications in connection with the Company’s current information system initiative may impact its
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

- 11 -


The Company is in the process of replacing various business information systems worldwide with an
enterprise resource planning system from SAP. On October 1, 2007, the Company successfully went
live with the SAP implementation at its North American Office Products business unit. This SAP
go-live marks the completion of the first major milestone in a multi-year implementation that will
occur in several phases, primarily based on geographic region and segment. This activity involves
the migration of multiple legacy systems and users to a common SAP information platform.
Throughout this process, the Company is changing the way it conducts business and employees’ roles
in processing and utilizing information. In addition, this conversion will impact certain
interfaces with the Company’s customers and suppliers, resulting in changes to the tools we use to
take orders, procure material, schedule production, remit billings, make payments and perform other
business functions. Based upon the complexity of this initiative, there is risk that the Company
will be unable to complete the implementation in accordance with its timeline and will incur
additional costs. The implementation could result in operating inefficiencies, and the
implementation could impact the Company’s ability to perform necessary business transactions. All
of these risks could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows.

Impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.

Future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the Company’s assets and
require impairment charges. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions
made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic
environment on the Company’s customer base, the unfavorable resolution of litigation, including
patent infringement litigation involving PSI Systems, Inc., or a material adverse change in the
Company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners.

Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the Company’s financial
results or harm its reputation or the value of its end-user brands.

Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the Company’s products arise in the
ordinary course of the Company’s business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary
judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that
could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of its
end-user brands. The Company could also be required to recall possibly defective products, which
could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product
liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a self-insured
retention or could be excluded under the terms of the policy.

ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES

2007, 2006 and 2005

Information regarding significant businesses acquired in the last three years is included in
Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


No significant acquisitions occurred during 2004.


Effective January 1, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of American Saw & Mfg. Co.
(“Lenox”), a leading manufacturer of power tool accessories and hand tools marketed under the Lenox
brand. The purchase price was approximately $450 million paid for through the issuance of
commercial paper, plus transaction costs. The transaction structure permits the deduction of
goodwill for tax purposes, which was approximately $85 million at the time of acquisition. This
acquisition and the acquisition of American Tool Companies, Inc. (“Irwin”) in 2002 marked a
significant expansion and enhancement of the Company’s product lines and customer base, launching
it squarely into the estimated $10 billion-plus global markets for hand tools and power tool
accessories. Both of these acquisitions are reported in the Company’s Tools & Hardware business
segment. The purchase price of the Lenox acquisition was allocated to the acquired assets and
liabilities based on their fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill.

The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to
an assessment and understanding of the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial
condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements and Notes thereto.

Executive Overview

Newell Rubbermaid is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that touch the lives of
people where they work, live and play. The Company’s multi-product offering consists of well known
name-brand consumer and commercial products in four business segments as follows:

aggregation criteria

The Company’s vision is to become a global company of Brands That Matter

TM

and great
people, known for best-in-class results. The Company remains committed to investing in strategic
brands and new product development, strengthening its portfolio of businesses, reducing its supply
chain costs and streamlining non-strategic selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A).

The key tenets of the Company’s strategy include building large, consumer-meaningful brands
(“Brands That Matter

TM

”), leveraging one Newell Rubbermaid, achieving a best total cost
position and commercializing innovation across the enterprise. The Company’s results depend on the
ability of its individual business units to succeed in their respective categories, each of which
has some unique consumers, customers and competitors. The Company’s

- 19 -


strategic initiatives are designed to help enable these business units generate differentiated
products, operate within a best-in-class cost structure and employ superior branding in order to
realize premium margins on their products. The business units use the premium margins to fund
incremental demand creation initiatives, driving incremental sales and profits for the Company.

The following section details the Company’s performance in each of its transformational
initiatives:

Create Consumer-Meaningful Brands

The Company is continuing to move from its historical focus on push marketing and excellence in
manufacturing and distributing products, to a new focus on consumer pull marketing and creating
competitive advantage through better understanding its consumers, innovating to deliver great
performance, investing in advertising and promotion to create demand and leveraging its brands in
adjacent categories around the world. This effort is creating and expanding core competencies and
processes centered on consumer understanding, innovation and demand creation, to drive sustainable
top line growth. The Company’s progress in implementing this brand building and marketing
initiative is exhibited by the following:

•

The Company’s Tools & Hardware segment achieved low single digit sales growth in 2007, due
largely to continued strength in its international Irwin and Lenox businesses. One of the
primary drivers of the growth in the Lenox business is its marketing efforts and the expansion
of its team of trained professionals who work with end users to educate them on the benefits,
use, installation, and servicing of its band saws.

•

In the Company’s Beauty and Style business, Goody has introduced a major marketing campaign
to support the introduction of its innovative Styling Therapy line of brushes that are infused
with special substances that help control dandruff, add shine, and protect hair color. Sales
of Styling Therapy products have doubled since the launch of the consumer driven advertising
and promotion campaign.

•

In the Company’s Office Products segment, the Dymo labeling technology business’ sales have
increased in 2007 due largely to aggressive television marketing campaigns in Europe.
Additionally, the Office Products segment is launching the Sharpie Ultra Fine Retractable
Marker in early 2008. This distinct product, developed based on consumer understanding and
demand, allows for precise permanent marking and writing with an easy one-handed operation.

Leverage One Newell Rubbermaid

The Company strives to leverage the common business activities and best practices of its business
units, and to build one common culture of shared values, with a focus on collaboration and
teamwork. The Company continuously explores ways to leverage common functional capabilities, such
as Human Resources, Information Technology, Customer Service, Supply Chain Management and Finance,
to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This broad reaching initiative already includes projects
such as the corporate consolidation of the distribution and transportation function and
consolidating Company-wide purchasing efforts. Additionally, during 2007, the Company streamlined
its organizational structure in its move to a consistent GBU structure throughout the Company. As
part of the transition to the new GBU structure, the Company recently created and expanded
leadership positions to identify and drive synergies across business units.

The Company also accelerated the process of creating shared services for the European businesses
and is expanding the scope of shared services in the U.S and Latin
America. The transition of services to the Shared
Service Center in Europe is approximately 90% complete.

On October 1, 2007, the Company’s Office Products segment successfully went live with the SAP
implementation for its North American operations. This SAP go-live marks the completion of the
first major milestone in a multi-year rollout aimed at migrating multiple legacy systems and users
to a common SAP global information platform. This will enable the Company to integrate and manage
its worldwide business and reporting processes more efficiently.

- 20 -


Achieve Best Total Cost

The Company’s objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing, sourcing and supplying product on
an ongoing basis, and to leverage the Company’s size and scale, in order to achieve a best total
cost position. Achieving best cost positions in its categories allows the Company to increase
investment in strategic brand building initiatives.

Through Project Acceleration and other initiatives, the Company has made significant progress in
reducing its supply chain costs and delivering productivity savings. Project Acceleration includes
the closure of approximately one-third of the Company’s 64 manufacturing facilities, optimizing the
Company’s geographic manufacturing footprint. Since the inception of Project Acceleration, the
Company has announced the closure of 16 manufacturing facilities and expects that approximately
eight additional facilities will be closed under this program. Project Acceleration is projected
to result in cumulative restructuring costs of approximately $375 million to $400 million ($315
million to $340 million after tax). Approximately 67% of the costs are expected to be cash.
Annualized savings are now projected to exceed $150 million upon conclusion of the project in 2009.
Additionally, the Company has broadened its supply chain efforts to include the realization of
efficiencies in purchasing and distribution and transportation in its move toward logistical
excellence. For example, the Company has consolidated the warehousing and logistics for all
product groups in the United Kingdom at a single site near Birmingham, England and has also opened
a new, 400,000 square foot consolidated Newell Rubbermaid distribution center in Victorville,
California.

Nurture 360º Innovation

The Company has broadened its definition of innovation beyond product invention. The Company
defines innovation as the successful commercialization of invention. It is a rigorous, consumer
centric process that permeates the entire development cycle. It begins with a deep understanding of
how consumers interact with the Company’s brands and categories, and all the factors that drive
their purchase decisions and in-use experience. That understanding must then be translated into
innovative products that deliver unique features and benefits, at a best-cost position, providing
the consumer with great value. Lastly, innovating how and where to create awareness and trial use,
and measuring the effectiveness of advertising and promotion spending, completes the process. The
Company has pockets of excellence using this expanded definition of innovation, and continues to
build on this competency in its effort to create consumer meaningful brands. Since the beginning
of 2007, the Company has launched a number of innovative new products including the Sharpie

®

Chisel
Tip,
Levolor

®

Roman
Shades, Lenox

®

Diamond™ saw blades, Graco

®

iMonitor™,
and the Rubbermaid

®

Premier line of premium food storage containers. Additionally, the
Company’s Baby and Parenting Essentials business launched the Graco Sweetpeace-Newborn Soothing
Center in early 2008, which was developed based on comprehensive research, with moms and
pediatric professionals, to understand what works best to calm babies.

Results of Operations — 2007 vs. 2006

Net sales for 2007 were $6,407.3 million, representing an increase of $206.3 million, or 3.3%, from
$6,201.0 million for 2006. Positive currency translation contributed approximately 2.0% of the
3.3% improvement. Excluding the effects of currency translation, sales increased 1.3%. The
increase was primarily related to Home & Family sales growth of 6.0% and Cleaning, Organization &
Décor sales growth of 4.1%, partially offset by a decrease in Office Products sales.

Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2007 was 35.2%, or $2,257.2 million, versus 33.4%,
or $2,070.0 million, for 2006. Ongoing productivity initiatives, favorable mix, and savings from
Project Acceleration, which contributed approximately $45 million to gross margin, drove the 185
basis point improvement year over year, with pricing offsetting raw material inflation.

SG&A expenses for 2007 were 22.3% of net sales, or $1,430.9 million, versus 21.7% of net sales, or
$1,347.0 million, for 2006. Approximately 38% of the increase is attributable to foreign currency,
with the remainder due to investments in brand building, product development and other corporate
initiatives, including SAP and Shared Services. These investments were partially offset by $15
million in savings from Project Acceleration and other structural overhead reductions.

The Company recorded restructuring costs of $86.0 million and $66.4 million for 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The Company expects cumulative pre-tax restructuring costs of $375 to $400 million,
approximately 67% of which are expected to be cash costs, over the life of the initiative, which
began in 2005 and is expected to conclude in 2009. Annualized savings are projected to exceed $150
million upon completion of the project, with an approximate $60 million of savings realized in
2007, of which an estimated $45 million in savings is included in the improvement in gross margin.
The Company projects an additional benefit from Project Acceleration of $60 million in 2008 and $30
million in 2009. The 2007 restructuring costs included $27.7 million of facility and other exit
costs, $36.4 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $21.9 million of exited
contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. Since the inception of Project
Acceleration, the Company has announced the closure of 16 manufacturing facilities and expects that
approximately eight additional facilities will be closed under this program. The 2006 restructuring
costs included $14.9 million of facility and other exit costs, $44.7 million of employee severance
and termination benefits and $6.8 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring
costs. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Operating income for 2007 was $740.3 million, or 11.6% of net sales, versus $656.6 million, or
10.6% of net sales, in 2006. This increase was driven by sales and gross margin expansion,
partially offset by the increased investment in brand building and product development initiatives,
expansion of shared services and implementation of SAP.

Net nonoperating expenses for 2007 were 1.7% of net sales, or $111.4 million, versus 2.3% of net
sales, or $141.7 million, for 2006. The decrease in net nonoperating expenses was mainly
attributable to a decrease in interest expense, reflecting a reduction in average debt outstanding
year over year and slightly lower average borrowing rates. See Footnote 17 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The effective tax rate was 23.8% for 2007 versus 8.6% for 2006. The change in the effective tax
rate is primarily related to the $41.3 million of income tax benefits recorded in 2007 compared to
$102.8 million income tax benefits recorded in 2006. The income tax benefits in 2007 and 2006
resulted from the favorable resolution of certain tax positions, the expiration of the statute of
limitations on certain deductions, and the reorganization of certain legal entities in Europe. See
Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The loss from discontinued operations for 2007 was $12.1 million, compared to $85.7 million for
2006. The loss on the disposal of discontinued operations for 2007 was $11.9 million, net of tax,
compared to a gain of $0.7 million, net of tax, for 2006. The 2007 loss related primarily to the
disposal of the remaining operations of the Home Décor Europe business. The 2006 gain related
primarily to the disposal of the Little Tikes business, partially offset by the loss recognized on
the disposal of portions of the Home Décor Europe business. The loss from operations of

- 22 -


discontinued operations for 2007 was $0.2 million, net of tax, compared to $86.4 million, net of
tax, for 2006. The 2007 loss related only to the results of the remaining operations of the Home
Décor Europe business, while the 2006 loss included a $50.9 million impairment charge to write off
goodwill of the Home Décor Europe business. See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

Results of Operations — 2006 vs. 2005

Net sales for 2006 were $6,201.0 million, representing an increase of $483.8 million, or 8.5%, from
$5,717.2 million for 2005. Excluding sales related to the Dymo acquisition, sales were up
approximately $268 million, or 4.7%, driven by core sales growth of approximately 2.6%. The impact
of positive currency translation and favorable pricing contributed approximately two points of
additional improvement.

Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2006 was 33.4%, or $2,070.0 million, versus 30.8%,
or $1,758.1 million, for 2005. The 260 basis point improvement in gross margin was driven by
productivity, favorable pricing, and favorable mix, which more than offset the impact of raw
material inflation.

SG&A expenses for 2006 were 21.7% of net sales, or $1,347.0 million, versus 19.5%, or $1,117.7
million, for 2005. Approximately 40% of the increase is related to the impact of acquisitions, 40%
represented increased investment in strategic brand building, and the remainder resulted from the
impact of foreign currency and stock option accounting and the pension curtailment benefit
recognized in 2005 that did not repeat in 2006.

The Company recorded restructuring costs of $66.4 million and $72.6 million for 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The 2006 restructuring costs included $14.9 million of facility and other exit
costs, $44.7 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $6.8 million of exited
contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The 2005 restructuring costs included $51.3
million in non-cash facility restructuring costs relating to Project Acceleration and $21.3 million
relating to restructuring actions approved prior to the commencement of Project Acceleration. The
$21.3 million of pre-Project Acceleration costs included $7.9 million of facility and other exit
costs, $11.1 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $2.3 million of exited
contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.

Operating income for 2006 was $656.6 million, or 10.6% of net sales, versus $567.4 million, or 9.9%
of net sales, in 2005. The improvement in operating margins is the result of increased sales and
gross margin expansion partially offset by increased investment in strategic brand building.

Net nonoperating expenses for 2006 were 2.3% of net sales, or $141.7 million, versus 1.8% of net
sales, or $104.0 million, for 2005. The increase in net nonoperating expenses is mainly
attributable to gains recognized in 2005 on the sale of property, plant and equipment and the
liquidation of a foreign subsidiary that did not repeat in 2006, along with an increase in net
interest expense, $132.0 million for 2006 compared to $127.1 million for 2005. The increase in net
interest expense was primarily due to higher borrowing rates and higher average debt balances. See
Footnote 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The effective tax rate was 8.6% for 2006 versus 12.3% for 2005. The change in the effective tax
rate is primarily related to $102.8 million income tax benefits recorded in 2006 compared to income
tax benefits of $73.9 million recorded in 2005, as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax
positions and the expiration of the statute of limitations on other deductions. See Footnote 16 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The loss from discontinued operations for 2006 was $85.7 million, compared to $155.0 million for
2005. The (gain) loss on the disposal of discontinued operations for 2006 was ($0.7) million, net
of tax, compared to $96.8 million, net of tax, for 2005. The 2006 gain was primarily related to
the disposal of the Little Tikes business, which was partially offset by the loss recognized on
disposal of portions of the Home Décor Europe business. The 2005 loss related primarily to the
disposal of the Curver and the European Cookware businesses. The loss from operations of
discontinued operations for 2006 was $86.4 million, net of tax, compared to $58.2 million, net of
tax, for 2005. See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

Net sales for 2007 were $2,096.4 million, an increase of $100.7 million, or 5.0%, from $1,995.7
million in 2006, driven by double digit sales growth in Rubbermaid Commercial Products, resulting
from new product launches during the year, mid single digit growth in Rubbermaid Home Products due
to growth in sales of home organization and insulated products, and low single digit growth in the
Rubbermaid Food and Levolor branded businesses.

Operating income for 2007 was $273.3 million, or 13.0% of sales, an increase of $64.2 million, or
30.7%, from $209.1 million in 2006. The improvement in operating income was the result of sales
growth driven by strategic SG&A investments and gross margin expansion, resulting from productivity
gains and favorable mix.

Office Products

Net sales for 2007 were $2,042.3 million, an increase of $10.7 million, or 0.5% from $2,031.6
million in 2006. Growth in the Office Technology business, driven by increased sales in the Dymo
business and the acquisition of Endicia, along with favorable foreign currency, was offset by
overall softness in the U.S. resulting from weaker foot traffic in the North American office
retailers and inventory corrections taken within that same channel.

Operating income for 2007 was $317.9 million, or 15.6% of sales, an increase of $30.9 million, or
10.8%, from $287.0 million in 2006. This increase primarily resulted from gross margin expansion,
resulting from favorable mix and pricing initiatives, partially offset by increased investment in
brand building activities.

Tools & Hardware

Net sales for 2007 were $1,288.7 million, an increase of $26.5 million, or 2.1%, from $1,262.2
million in 2006. The successful commercialization of certain products, particularly bandsaws, and
favorable foreign currency drove sales growth in Europe and Latin America, which more than offset
continued softness in the domestic tool and hardware businesses affected primarily by the U.S.
residential construction market. The Company continues to experience solid growth in the Irwin and
Lenox branded products which combined yielded mid single digit growth for the year.

Operating income for 2007 was $181.5 million, or 14.1% of sales, a decrease of $3.5 million, or
1.9%, from $185.0 million in 2006. Top line growth and productivity initiatives were more than
offset by investments in strategic brand building.

- 24 -


Home & Family

Net sales for 2007 were $979.9 million, an increase of $68.4 million, or 7.5%, from $911.5 million
in 2006. Broad based success in all three business units was fueled by new product launches and
better sell-through resulting from demand creation activities.

Operating income for 2007 was $135.6 million, or 13.8% of sales, an increase of $17.7 million, or
15.0%, from $117.9 million in 2006. The increase was primarily driven by top line sales growth
supported by increased SG&A investments.

Net sales for 2006 were $1,995.7 million, an increase of $74.7 million, or 3.9%, from $1,921.0
million in 2005, driven by mid single-digit growth in Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Rubbermaid
Home Products. New product innovation, a strong back to campus season, a successful year in
insulated products and strong sales in the size in store and custom blind products drove the sales
improvement over 2005. Partially offsetting this increase were low margin product line exits,
specifically related to basic drapery hardware.

Operating income for 2006 was $209.1 million, an increase of $63.3 million, or 43.4%, from $145.8
million in 2005. The increase in operating income was driven by the sales volume increases
described above coupled with productivity initiatives and pricing actions put in place to offset
raw material inflation.

Office Products

Net sales for 2006 were $2,031.6 million, an increase of $318.3 million, or 18.6% from $1,713.3
million in 2005. Excluding sales related to the Dymo acquisition, sales increased approximately
6%, led by strong performance in the Everyday Writing and Marker businesses.

Operating income for 2006 was $287.0 million, an increase of $21.0 million, or 7.9%, from $266.0
million in 2005. Additional income from the Dymo acquisition and the sales volume increase
described above were partially offset by strategic brand building spending, restructuring related
inefficiencies and acquisition related start-up costs.

Tools & Hardware

Net sales for 2006 were $1,262.2 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 0.2%, from $1,260.3
million in 2005, as mid single-digit growth in the Irwin and Lenox branded tools businesses was
offset by the decline in the consumer electronic tools business. Sales of other product lines
increased approximately 3% in the segment, despite the challenging housing and retail environment.

Operating income for 2006 was $185.0 million, an increase of $13.9 million, or 8.1%, from $171.1
million in 2005. Productivity initiatives were partially offset by strategic brand building
investment and raw material inflation, particularly in aluminum, zinc and brass.

Home & Family

Net sales for 2006 were $911.5 million, an increase of $88.9 million, or 10.8%, from $822.6 million
in 2005. Broad based success in all three business units was fueled by sales of new products and
consumer demand driven by targeted strategic SG&A investment.

Operating income for 2006 was $117.9 million, an increase of $14.4 million, or 13.9%, from $103.5
million in 2005, driven by an increase in sales and productivity, partially offset by increased
SG&A investment.

Sources

Historically, the Company’s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have included cash
provided by operations, proceeds from divestitures and use of available borrowing facilities.

Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $655.3 million
compared to $643.4 million for the comparable period of 2006. The increase in cash provided by
operating activities is primarily a result of increased net income, offset by increased investments
in working capital, including cash restructuring costs.

In 2007, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $420.8 million compared to
$177.0 million in 2006. Proceeds in 2007 reflect the issuance of commercial paper to fund the
acquisition of PSI Systems, Inc. (“Endicia”), a provider of Endicia Internet postage, and to pay
off a $250.0 million, 6.0% fixed rate medium-term note that matured.

On November 14, 2005, the Company entered into a $750.0 million five-year syndicated revolving
credit facility (the “Revolver”). On an annual basis, the Company may request an extension of the
Revolver (subject to lender approval) for additional one-year periods. The Company elected to
extend the Revolver for additional one-year periods in both October 2006 and October 2007, and, as
a result, the Revolver will now expire in November 2012. All but one lender approved the 2006 and
2007 extensions. Accordingly, the Company has a $750.0 million facility through November 2010, and
a $725.0 million facility from November 2010 to November 2012. At December 31, 2007 and 2006,
there were no borrowings under the Revolver.

In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $750.0 million of commercial
paper through 2010 and $725.0 million thereafter through 2012. The Revolver provides the committed
backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be
issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. The Revolver also provides for
the issuance of up to $100.0 million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient
amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. At December 31, 2007,

- 26 -


there was $197.0 million of commercial paper outstanding, classified as current long-term debt, and
no standby letters of credit issued under the Revolver. At December 31, 2006, there was no
commercial paper outstanding and there were no standby letters of credit issued under the Revolver.

The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms and requires,
among other things, that the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness to
Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The Revolver also limits Subsidiary
Indebtedness, as defined in the agreement. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company was in
compliance with the terms of the agreement governing the Revolver.

Under a 2001 receivables facility with a financial institution, the Company created a financing
entity that is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. Under this facility, the
Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an undivided interest
in substantially all of the Company’s U.S. trade receivables to the financing entity. In 2001, the
financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution.
Certain levels of accounts receivable write-offs and other events would permit the financial
institution to terminate the receivables facility. On September 18, 2006, in accordance with the
terms of the receivables facility, the financing entity caused the preferred debt securities to be
exchanged for cash of $2.2 million, a two year floating rate note in an aggregate principal amount
of $448.0 million and a cash premium of $5.2 million. Because this debt matures in September 2008,
the entire amount is considered to be short-term at December 31, 2007. At any time prior to
maturity of the note, the holder may elect to convert it into new preferred debt securities of the
financing entity with a par value equal to the outstanding principal amount of the note. The note
must be repaid and any preferred debt securities into which the note is converted must be retired
or redeemed before the Company can have access to the financing entity’s receivables. As of
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold under
this facility was $643.3 million and $696.7 million, respectively. The receivables and the
preferred debt securities or note, as applicable, are recorded in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company.

The Company believes that available cash, cash flows generated from future operations, access to
debt markets and availability under its revolving credit facility, including issuing commercial
paper, will be adequate to fund the Company’s short-term and long-term financing needs.

Uses

Historically, the Company’s primary uses of liquidity and capital resources have included
acquisitions, dividend payments, capital expenditures and payments on debt.

In 2007, the Company made payments on notes payable, commercial paper and long-term debt of $478.3
million compared to $511.0 million in 2006. In 2007, the Company issued commercial paper to fund
the acquisition of Endicia and to retire a $250.0 million, 6.0% fixed rate medium-term note that
matured. In 2006, the Company used available cash to pay off commercial paper and retire a $150.0
million, 6.6% fixed rate medium-term note that matured. See Footnote 10 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions.

Aggregate dividends paid were $234.7 million and $232.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In
2008, the Company expects to make similar dividend payments.

Capital expenditures were $157.3 million and $138.3 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
increase in capital expenditures was driven by spending related to the Company’s SAP initiative.
Capital expenditures, including SAP, for 2008 are expected to be in the range of $160 million to
$180 million.

Cash used for acquisitions was $106.0 million in 2007, compared to $60.6 million in 2006. In 2007,
the Company acquired Endicia for $51.2 million. In 2006, the Company did not invest in significant
acquisitions. See Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

Cash used for restructuring activities was $53.1 million and $26.1 million in 2007 and 2006,
respectively. These payments relate primarily to employee termination benefits. In 2008, the
Company expects to use approximately $100 million of cash on restructuring activities related to
Project Acceleration. See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

- 27 -


In 2007, the Company used net cash of $2.3 million for the disposals of businesses and assets. The
amount included payments for transaction fees relating to the divestiture of the Home Décor Europe
and Little Tikes businesses, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of facilities. The
Company generated cash proceeds from the disposal of noncurrent assets and sale of businesses of
$187.0 million in 2006 relating primarily to the sale of the European Cookware and Little Tikes
businesses, as well as the largest portion of its Home Décor Europe business.

Liquidity Metrics

Working capital at December 31, 2007 was $87.9 million compared to $580.3 million at December 31,
2006. The current ratio at December 31, 2007 was 1.03:1 compared to 1.31:1 at December 31, 2006.
The decrease in working capital is due to an increase of approximately $700 million in current
portion of long-term debt. See Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash equivalents, and total
capitalization includes total debt and stockholders’ equity) was .45:1 at December 31, 2007 and
..52:1 at December 31, 2006.

The Company believes that cash provided from operations and available borrowing facilities will
continue to provide adequate support for the cash needs of existing businesses on a short-term
basis; however, certain events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional external
financing on a long-term basis.

Resolution of Income Tax Contingencies

In 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded $41.3 million and $102.8 million, respectively, in income
tax benefits as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the IRS, the
expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters and the reorganization of certain
legal entities in Europe. These benefits are reflected in the Company’s 2007 and 2006 Consolidated
Statements of Income.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in its
consolidated financial statements. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other
executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or
inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2007 and future minimum lease payments
for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements.

The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations
listed below are expected to have on the Company’s cash flow in the indicated period. In addition,
the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of
December 31, 2007. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

Primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of December 31, 2007 for
finished goods, raw materials, components and services and joint venture interests
pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations, which include all significant
terms. The Company is obligated to purchase the minority interest of a majority owned
subsidiary in 2009. The estimated purchase price of that commitment is included in the
purchase obligations amount shown in the table above.

(5)

Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2007
balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long-term debt.

The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. As a
large taxpayer, the Company is under continual audit by the Internal Revenue Service and other
taxing authorities on several open tax positions, and it is possible that the amount of the
liability for uncertain tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming
year. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year,
the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will
increase or decrease over time; therefore, the $164.4 million in unrecognized tax benefits at
December 31, 2007 is excluded from the preceding table. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical
benefit plans. See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $87.6 million in standby letters of credit primarily
related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product
liability and medical. See Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements,
as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in that footnote, the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with
absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.
Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the Company’s critical
accounting policies.

Sales Recognition

Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all
substantial risks of ownership change, which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery
based upon contractual terms. Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer
discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales related
discounts.

Recovery of Accounts Receivable

The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
When aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the
case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial
position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to
the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for
bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the
receivables are past due and historical collection experience. Accounts are reviewed for potential
write-off on a case by case basis. Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of expected
recoveries. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Company’s estimates of the
recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
allowances for doubtful accounts of $26.1 million on $1,192.5 million of accounts receivable.

- 29 -


Inventory Reserves

The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an
amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based
upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The
Company conducts its annual test for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process.

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually at the operating segment level (herein
referred to as the reporting unit). The Company also tests for impairment if events and
circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
below its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair
value, impairment may be present. The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for
its goodwill based on discounted cash flow models, earnings multiples or an actual sales offer
received from a prospective buyer, if available. The use of a discounted cash flow model involves
several assumptions, and changes in our assumptions could materially impact our fair value
estimates. Assumptions critical to the Company’s fair value estimates under the discounted cash
flow model include the discount rate, projected average revenue growth, projected long-term growth
rates in the determination of terminal values, and product costs. A one percentage point increase
in the discount rate used to determine the fair values of our reporting units, which were not
deemed to be impaired based on the testing of goodwill in the third quarter as described above,
would not cause the carrying value of any reporting unit to exceed its fair value.

The Company measures the amount of any goodwill impairment based upon the estimated fair value of
the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible
assets, and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to
the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.

The Company also evaluates indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and trade
names) for impairment annually. The Company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances
indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible
asset is below its carrying amount. Assumptions critical to the Company’s evaluation of
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment include: the discount rate, royalty rates used in
its evaluation of trade names, projected average revenue growth, and projected long-term growth
rates in the determination of terminal values. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying
amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement
date.

No impairment charges were recorded by the Company as a result of the annual impairment testing
performed in the third quarter of 2007 and 2006.

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value
of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic
decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic
environment on the Company’s customer base, or a material negative change in its relationships with
significant customers.

Capitalized Software Costs

The Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software during the application
development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the Company’s
management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development. Capitalized
internal-use software costs include: (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed
in developing or obtaining the software; (ii) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who
are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project; and (iii) interest costs
incurred while developing the software. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the
point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. The
Company expenses as incurred research and development, general and administrative and indirect
costs associated with internal-use software. In addition, the Company expenses as incurred
training, maintenance and other internal-use software costs incurred during the post-implementation
stage. Costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal-use

- 30 -


software are only capitalized if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software.
Capitalized software costs were $131.4 million and $86.3 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of
December 31, 2007 or 2006.

The Company amortizes internal-use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of the software. Capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of
impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner
in which the software is being used. Impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values
at the date of evaluation.

Other Long-Lived Assets

The Company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property, plant and
equipment and other long-lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a
significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant
adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or
in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history
of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with
the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the Company
estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted
future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying
amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and
expenses, working capital, and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the
Company’s strategic plan. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash
flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar
investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value
and the carrying value of the asset group. Generally, the Company performs its testing of the
asset group at the product-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash
flows are available.

Product Liability Reserves

The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for
self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses
historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant
individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product
liability reserves. The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred
but not reported when determining the Company’s product liability reserve. The Company has product
liability reserves of $34.4 million as of December 31, 2007. While the Company believes that it
has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the
amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material to the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Legal and Environmental Reserves

The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local and
foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other disputes. The Company evaluates the
potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable
loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters.
The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and
remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred
and the cost can be reasonably estimated. No insurance recovery is taken into account in
determining the Company’s cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost estimates or reserve
reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long-term operations and
maintenance Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability (“CERCLA”) matters
which are estimated at present value. The Company’s estimate of environmental response costs
associated with these matters as of December 31, 2007 ranged between $14.5 million and $33.9
million. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had a reserve of $18.8 million for such
environmental response costs in the aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and
other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Income Taxes

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes”, the Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability
approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of
temporary differences between the

- 31 -


financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax
rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will
more likely than not be realized. No provision is made for the U.S. income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently
reinvested.

The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Although the Company
believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has
established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge
the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The
Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical
profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing
temporary differences and tax planning strategies.

The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), on January 1, 2007. FIN 48
requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of
tax positions. The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of tax
authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or
decrease the Company’s effective tax rate, as well as impact operating results. The adoption of
FIN 48 did not result in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings; however it did result in the
reclassification of certain income tax assets and liabilities from current to long-term in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in
calculating such amounts. The primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health
care cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and rate of compensation
increase, discussed below:

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the
assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and therefore, generally affect
recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that
the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions
may affect the Company’s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense. See
Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the
assumptions used. The following tables summarize the Company’s pension and other postretirement
plan assets and obligations included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007 (

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised
2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) significantly changes the accounting
for business combination transactions by requiring an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value.
Additionally, SFAS 141(R) modifies the accounting treatment for certain specified items related to
business combinations and requires a substantial number of new disclosures. SFAS 141(R) is
effective for business combinations with an acquisition date in fiscal years beginning on or after
December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company expects to  prospectively adopt SFAS
141(R) on January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160,
“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51” (“SFAS
160”). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in
subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income
attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership
interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes reporting requirements that require sufficient
disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the
interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or
after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited.  SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The Company is still in the process of evaluating the impact SFAS 160 will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value under generally accepted accounting principles, and requires expanded disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an
entity-specific measurement, and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on
the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. SFAS 157
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the
FASB having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant
measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. In
February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Positions 157-1 and 157-2 which remove certain leasing
transactions from the scope of SFAS 157 and partially defer the effective date of SFAS 157 for one
year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007.  The Company prospectively adopted the effective provisions of SFAS 157 on January 1,
2008. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

Forward-looking statements in this Report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements may relate
to, but are not limited to, information or assumptions about the effects of Project Acceleration,
sales (including pricing), income/(loss), earnings per share, operating income or gross margin
improvements, return on equity, return on invested capital, capital expenditures, working capital,
cash flow, dividends, capital structure, debt to capitalization ratios, interest rates, internal
growth rates, restructuring, impairment and other charges, potential losses on divestitures, impact
of changes in accounting standards, pending legal proceedings and claims (including environmental
matters), future economic performance, costs and cost savings (including raw material inflation,
productivity and streamlining), synergies, management’s plans, goals and objectives for future
operations, performance and growth or the assumptions relating to any of the forward-looking
statements. These statements generally are accompanied by words such as “intend,” “anticipate,”
“believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “plan,” “expect,” “will,” “should,” “would” or similar
statements. The Company cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees because there
are inherent difficulties in predicting future results. Actual results could differ materially from
those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual
results to differ include, but are not limited to, those matters set forth in this Report generally
and Item 1A to this Report. Some of these factors are described as criteria for success. The
Company’s failure to achieve, or limited success in achieving, these objectives could result in
actual results differing materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking
statements. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and
assessed all of the factors affecting the Company or that the publicly available and other
information the Company receives with respect to these factors is complete or correct.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

The Company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates
and certain commodity prices. Pursuant to the Company’s policies, natural hedging techniques and
derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market
prices. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.

The Company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix
of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures
when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for qualifying hedges, the interest differential
of swaps is included in interest expense.

The Company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany
and third party commercial transaction exposures of one-year duration or less. The Company focuses
on natural hedging techniques of the following form: 1) offsetting or netting of like foreign
currency flows, 2) structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to
reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk, 3)
converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S. dollars or the relevant functional currency
and 4) avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency. In
addition, the Company primarily utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge
commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of
commercial and intercompany

- 34 -


transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions. Derivatives
used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses
included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company purchases certain raw materials, including resin, corrugate, steel, stainless steel,
aluminum and other metals, which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors.
While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, a variety of programs, including
periodic raw material purchases, purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price
adjustments help the Company address this risk. Where practical, the Company uses derivatives as
part of its risk management process.

The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the Company could
incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the
value-at-risk estimation model. The value-at-risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and
interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It
estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a
variance/covariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures (specifically
excluding equity-method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table below have no impact
on results of operations or financial condition, but are shown as an illustration of the impact of
potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. The following table
indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

(dollars in
millions

):

Commodity price risk is not shown because the amounts are not material.

The 95% confidence interval signifies the Company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would
not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the Company’s favor. The
value-at-risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse. Actual experience
has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly unlikely that
the Company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time. These amounts
should not be considered projections of future losses, because actual results may differ
significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. is responsible for the accuracy and internal consistency
of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and footnotes contained in this annual
report.

The Company’s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Newell Rubbermaid Inc. operates under a system of internal
accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The internal accounting control system is evaluated for
effectiveness by management and is tested, monitored and revised as necessary. All internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making its assessment, the Company’s management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on the results of its evaluation, the
Company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, have audited the
financial statements prepared by the management of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. and the effectiveness of
Newell Rubbermaid Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting. Their reports on the financial
statements and on the effectiveness of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting are presented below.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Newell Rubbermaid Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. and subsidiaries at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 16, in 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” Also, as
discussed in Notes 1 and 13, in 2006 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans,” and the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123(R), “Share-Based Payment.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Newell Rubbermaid Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Newell Rubbermaid Inc.

We have audited Newell Rubbermaid Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO
criteria). Newell Rubbermaid Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s
Responsibility for Financial Statements and Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO
criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.
as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2007 of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. and our report dated
February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOOTNOTE 1

Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Newell Rubbermaid is a global marketer of consumer and commercial
products that touch the lives of people where they work, live and play. The Company’s strong
portfolio of brands includes Sharpie

®

, Paper Mate

®

, Dymo

®

, Expo

. The Company’s
multi-product offering consists of well known name-brand consumer and commercial products in four
business segments: Cleaning, Organization & Décor; Office Products; Tools & Hardware; and Other
(Home & Family).

Principles of Consolidation:

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the
Company, its majority owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities where the Company is the
primary beneficiary, after elimination of intercompany transactions.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of certain
estimates by management in determining the Company’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain 2006 and 2005 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2007
presentation.

Concentration of Credit Risk:

The Company sells products to customers in diversified industries
and geographic regions and, therefore, has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The
Company continuously evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers and generally does not require
collateral.

The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
When aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the
case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial
position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to
the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for
bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the
receivables are past due and historical collection experience. Accounts are also reviewed for
potential write-off on a case by case basis. Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of
expected recoveries. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Company’s
estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.

The Company’s forward exchange contracts, long-term cross currency interest rate swaps, and option
contracts do not subject the Company to risk due to foreign exchange rate movement, because gains
and losses on these instruments generally offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and
other transactions being hedged. The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of
non-performance by counterparties to certain derivative financial instruments. The Company does
not obtain collateral or other security to support derivative financial instruments subject to
credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties.

The credit exposure that results from commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange risk is the
fair value of contracts with a positive fair value as of the reporting date. The credit exposure
on the Company’s interest rate derivatives and foreign currency derivatives at December 31, 2007
was $1.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively. The credit exposure on the Company’s commodity
derivatives at December 31, 2007 was immaterial.

Sales Recognition:

Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title
passes and all substantial risks of ownership change, which generally occurs either upon shipment
or upon delivery based upon contractual terms. Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts,
returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other
sales related discounts.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on-hand and highly-liquid
investments that have a maturity of three months or less when purchased.

- 43 -


Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) or first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods (see Footnote 5 for additional information).
The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an
amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based
upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation expense is calculated
principally on the straight-line basis. Useful lives determined by the Company are as follows:
buildings and improvements (20-40 years) and machinery and equipment (3-12 years).

Goodwill
and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets:

The Company
conducts its annual test for
impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter because it
coincides with its annual strategic planning process.

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually at the operating segment level (herein
referred to as the reporting unit). The Company also tests for impairment if events and
circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
below its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair
value, impairment may be present. The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for
its goodwill based on discounted cash flow models, earnings multiples or an actual sales offer
received from a prospective buyer, if available. Assumptions critical to the Company’s fair value
estimates under the discounted cash flow model include the discount rate, projected average revenue
growth, projected long-term growth rates in the determination of terminal values, and product
costs.

The Company measures the amount of any goodwill impairment based upon the estimated fair value of
the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible
assets, and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to
the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.

The Company also evaluates indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and trade
names) for impairment annually. The Company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances
indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible
asset is below its carrying amount. Assumptions critical to the Company’s evaluation of
indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate, royalty rates used in
its evaluation of trade names, projected average revenue growth, and projected long-term growth
rates in the determination of terminal values. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying
amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement
date.

See Footnote 7 for additional detail on goodwill and other intangible assets.

Other Long-Lived Assets:

The Company tests its other long-lived assets for impairment in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The Company evaluates if impairment indicators
related to its property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present. These
impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset
or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or
asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow
loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates
continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If impairment
indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of
assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets
is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions
regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, and proceeds from asset disposals on a
basis consistent with the strategic plan. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the
undiscounted future cash flows, the Company determines the assets’ fair value by discounting the
future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records
an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset
group. Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product-line level,
as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.

- 44 -


Shipping and Handling Costs:

The Company records shipping and handling costs as a component of
costs of products sold.

Product Liability Reserves:

The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that
includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer
insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods,
review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining
required product liability reserves. The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account
claims incurred but not reported when determining the Company’s product liability reserve. While
the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of
these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be
material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Product Warranties:

In the normal course of business, the Company offers warranties for a variety
of its products. The specific terms and conditions of the warranties vary depending upon the
specific product and markets in which the products were sold. The Company accrues for the
estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale based on historical experience.

Advertising Costs:

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Cooperative advertising
with customers is recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a reduction of net sales and
totaled $149.5 million, $153.3 million and $147.4 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
All other advertising costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and
totaled $216.5 million, $199.9 million and $135.6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Research and Development Costs:

Research and development costs relating to both future and current
products are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. These costs
aggregated $111.2 million, $102.0 million and $92.5 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

The Company follows SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. Derivative financial instruments are generally
used to manage certain commodity, interest rate and foreign currency risks. These instruments
include commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, long-term cross currency interest rate swaps, forward
exchange contracts and options. The Company’s forward exchange contracts, options and long-term
cross currency interest rate swaps do not subject the Company to risk due to foreign exchange rate
movement because gains and losses on these instruments generally offset gains and losses on the
assets, liabilities, and other transactions being hedged.

On the date in which the Company enters into a derivative, the derivative is designated as a hedge
of the identified exposure. The Company measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both
at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis. No ineffectiveness was recorded on designated hedges
in 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Interest Rate Risk Management:

Gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow
hedges, to the extent that the hedge relationship has been effective, are deferred in other
comprehensive income and recognized in interest expense over the period in which the Company
recognizes interest expense on the related debt instrument. Any ineffectiveness on these
instruments is immediately recognized in interest expense in the period that the ineffectiveness
occurs.

The Company also has designated certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges, which have been
structured to be 100% effective. These hedging instruments include interest rate swaps, long-term
cross currency interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. See foreign currency management
below for discussion of cross currency interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts Gains or
losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swaps are deferred as an increase or
decrease to the carrying value of the related debt and amortized as an adjustment to the yield of
the related debt instrument over the remaining period originally covered by the swap. The cash
received or paid relating to the termination of interest rate swaps is included in Other as an
operating activity in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Foreign Currency Management:

The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts and options to manage
foreign exchange risk related to both known and anticipated intercompany transactions and
third-party commercial transaction exposures of approximately one year in duration or less. The
effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other
comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same

- 45 -


period or periods in which the hedged transactions affect earnings. Any ineffective portion is
immediately recognized in earnings.

The Company also utilizes long-term cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge long-term
intercompany financing transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange
contracts, which hedge certain anticipated transactions are recognized in other comprehensive
income as an asset or liability until the underlying transaction occurs.

The asset or liability related to these transactions is recorded in the captions Prepaid expenses
and other, Other assets, Other accrued liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet depending on the maturity of the Company’s cross currency interest rate
swaps and forward contracts at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The earnings impact of cash flow hedges
relating to forecasted purchases of inventory is generally reported in cost of products sold to
match the underlying transaction being hedged. For hedged forecasted transactions, hedge accounting
is discontinued if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, in which case
previously deferred hedging gains or losses would be recorded to earnings immediately. The gains
and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings upon
completion of the underlying transaction being hedged.

The fair value of foreign currency hedging instruments is recorded in the captions Prepaid expenses
and other, Other assets, Other accrued liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets depending on the maturity of the Company’s cross currency interest rate
swaps and forward contracts at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The earnings impact of cash flow hedges
relating to forecasted purchases of inventory is generally reported in cost of products sold to
match the underlying transaction being hedged. For hedged forecasted transactions, hedge
accounting is discontinued if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, in
which case previously deferred hedging gains or losses would be recorded to earnings immediately.

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The Company’s financial instruments include
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable and short and long-term debt. The
fair value of these instruments approximates carrying values due to their short-term duration,
except as follows:

Qualifying Derivative Instruments: The fair value of the Company’s qualifying derivative
instruments is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is described in more detail in
Footnote 11.

Long-term Debt: The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt issued under the medium-term note
program and the junior convertible subordinated debentures are based on quoted market prices and
are as follows as of December 31,

(in millions)

:



Medium-term note program

$1,085.2

$1,321.7

Junior convertible subordinated debentures

$390.7

$398.1

All other significant long-term debt is pursuant to floating rate instruments whose carrying
amounts approximate fair value.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into
U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at year-end. The related translation adjustments
are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive income. Income and expenses are translated at
the average monthly rates of exchange in effect during the year. Gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions of these subsidiaries are included in net income. International subsidiaries
operating in highly inflationary economies translate nonmonetary assets at historical rates, while
net monetary assets are translated at current rates, with the resulting translation adjustment
included in net income as other expense (income), net.

Income Taxes:

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”, the Company accounts
for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred
income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more
likely than not be realized. No provision is made for the U.S. income taxes on the undistributed
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered to be permanently invested.

- 46 -


The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Although the Company
believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has
established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge
the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The
Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical
profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing
temporary differences and tax planning strategies.

The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), on January 1, 2007. FIN 48
requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of
tax positions. The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of tax
authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or
decrease the Company’s effective tax rate, as well as impact operating results. The adoption of
FIN 48 did not result in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings; however, it did result in
the reclassification of certain income tax assets and liabilities from current to long-term in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Footnote 16 for additional information on income taxes.

Stock-Based Compensation:

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company recognized stock-based
compensation expense by applying the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”). Under APB
25, the Company generally recognized compensation expense only for restricted stock grants. The
Company recognized the compensation expense associated with the restricted stock ratably over the
associated service period.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”), using the modified prospective transition method, and
therefore has not restated the results of prior periods. Under this transition method, stock-based
compensation expense for 2007 and 2006 includes (i) compensation expense for all stock-based
compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant
date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” and (ii) compensation expense for all share-based payment awards
granted after January 1, 2006 based on estimated grant-date fair values estimated in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Compensation expense is adjusted for estimated forfeitures and
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is
generally five years for stock options and three years for restricted stock. The Company estimates
future forfeiture rates based on its historical experience. See Footnote 15 for additional
information.

The following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s net income and earnings per share to pro
forma net income and pro forma earnings per share as if the Company had adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 123 with respect to options granted under the Company’s stock option plans in 2005

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007),
“Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) significantly changes the accounting for
business combination transactions by requiring an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value.
Additionally, SFAS 141(R) modifies the accounting treatment for certain specified items related to
business combinations and requires a substantial number of new disclosures. SFAS 141(R) is
effective for business combinations with an acquisition date in fiscal years beginning on or after
December 15, 2008, and earlier adoption is prohibited. The Company expects to prospectively adopt
SFAS 141(R) on January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and
reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent,
the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling
interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling
equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes reporting
requirements that require sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the
interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for
fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited. SFAS 160
is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The Company is still in the process of evaluating
the impact SFAS 160 will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted
accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 emphasizes
that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and states that
a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability. SFAS 157 applies under other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously concluded
in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute.
Accordingly, SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB
issued Staff Positions 157-1 and 157-2 which remove certain leasing transactions from its scope and
partially defer the effective date of SFAS 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and
liabilities. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The
Company prospectively adopted the effective provisions of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008. The adoption
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Acquisition of Endicia

On July 1, 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of PSI Systems, Inc.
(“Endicia”), provider of Endicia Internet Postage, for $51.2 million plus related acquisition costs
and contingent payments of up to $25.0 million based on future revenues. The acquisition of
Endicia, a leading provider of online postage, increases the Company’s ability to leverage its
other technology brands by developing a full range of innovative and integrated solutions for small
and medium-sized businesses. This acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and accordingly, based on a preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company recorded
goodwill of $46.2 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007. Pro forma results
of operations would not be materially different as a result of this acquisition and therefore are
not presented.

Endicia is party to a lawsuit filed against it alleging patent infringement. In this case,
Stamps.com seeks injunctive relief in order to prevent Endicia from continuing to engage in
activities that are alleged to infringe on Stamps.com’s patents. An unfavorable outcome in this
litigation, which management does not believe is probable, could materially

- 48 -


adversely affect the Endicia business.

Acquisition of Dymo

On November 23, 2005, the Company acquired Dymo, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and
marketing on-demand labeling solutions, from Esselte AB. The purchase price of $699.2 million was
finalized in 2006, after consideration of certain working capital and other adjustments. The
Company funded the purchase payment through a combination of available cash of $480.2 million and
debt of $219.0 million from pre-existing credit facilities. In 2006, the Company finalized the
purchase price allocation of $699.2 million to the identifiable assets and liabilities. The
purchase price allocation was based on management’s estimate of fair value using the assistance of
third party appraisals at the date of acquisition as follows

The allocation of the purchase price resulted in the recognition of $609.3 million of goodwill,
primarily related to the anticipated future earnings and cash flows of the Dymo business including
the estimated effects of the integration of this business into the Office Products segment. The
transaction resulted in the recognition of $118.9 million in intangible assets consisting primarily
of customer lists, patents and trademarks. Approximately $77.4 million were indefinite-lived
intangible assets related to trademarks and $41.5 million related to finite-lived intangible assets
that will be amortized over periods of 3 to 10 years with a weighted average amortization period of
5.3 years.

The transaction summarized above was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the
results of operations are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements since the
acquisition date. The acquisition costs included in the purchase price were allocated to goodwill.

The unaudited consolidated results of operations on a pro forma basis, as though the November 23,
2005 acquisition of Dymo had been completed on January 1, 2005, are as follows for the year ended
December 31,

Home Décor Europe

The Home Décor Europe business designed, manufactured and sold drapery hardware and window
treatments in Europe under Gardinia

®

and other local brands and was previously classified in the
Company’s former Home Fashions segment. In 2005, Home Décor Europe had net sales of approximately
$377 million.

In the first quarter of 2006, as a result of a revised corporate strategy and an initiative to
improve the Company’s portfolio of businesses to focus on those that are best aligned with the
Company’s strategies of differentiated products, best cost and consumer branding, the Company began
exploring various options for its Home Décor Europe business. Those options included marketing the
business for potential sale. As a result of this effort, the Company received a preliminary offer
from a potential buyer which gave the Company a better indication of the business’ fair value.
Based on this offer, the Company determined that the business had a net book value in excess of its
fair value. Due to the apparent decline in value, the Company conducted an impairment test and
recorded a $50.9 million impairment charge in the first quarter of 2006. This charge, as well as
the operations of this business during 2006 and 2005, are included in the loss from operations of
discontinued operations in the table above.

In September 2006, the Company entered into an agreement for the intended sale of portions of the
Home Décor Europe business to a global manufacturer and marketer of window treatments and
furnishings. The Central and Eastern European, Nordic and Portuguese operations of this business
were sold on December 1, 2006. The sale of the operations in Poland and the Ukraine closed on
February 1, 2007.

- 50 -


In October 2006, the Company received a binding offer for the intended sale of the Southern
European region of the Home Décor Europe business to another party, which represented the remaining
operations of the Home Décor Europe business. The sale of operations in France and Spain closed on
January 1, 2007 and in Italy on January 31, 2007.

In connection with these transactions, the Company recorded a loss of $11.3 million, net of tax, in
2006. In 2007, the Company recorded a loss of $10.0 million, net of tax, to complete the
divestiture of Home Décor Europe. The net loss for 2007 and 2006 are reported in the table above as
part of the gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations.

Little Tikes

In September 2006, the Company entered into an agreement for the intended sale of its Little Tikes
business unit to a global family and children’s entertainment company. Little Tikes is a global
marketer and manufacturer of children’s toys and furniture for consumers. The transaction closed in
the fourth quarter of 2006, resulting in a gain of $16.0 million, net of tax, in 2006. This
business was previously included in the Company’s Other (Home & Family) segment. The operations of
the business for 2006 and 2005 are included in loss from operations of discontinued operations in
the table above. In 2005, Little Tikes had net sales of approximately $250 million.

European Cookware

In October 2005, the Company entered into an agreement for the intended sale of its European
Cookware business. The Company completed this divestiture on January 1, 2006. This business
included the brands Pyrex

®

(used under exclusive license from Corning Incorporated and its
subsidiaries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa only) and Vitri

®

and was previously included in
the Company’s Other (Home & Family) segment. In connection with this transaction, the Company
recorded a loss related to the sale of $33.9 million in 2005 and an additional loss of $1.6 million
upon completion of the sale in 2006. The losses are reported in the table above as loss on disposal
of discontinued operations. In 2005, the European Cookware business had net sales of approximately
$115 million.

Curver

In January 2005, the Company entered into an agreement for the intended sale of the Company’s
Curver business. In June 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Curver business. The Curver
business included the Company’s European indoor organization and home storage division and was
previously reported in the former Cleaning & Organization segment. The sales price, which was
subject to reduction for working capital adjustments, was $5 million, paid at closing, plus a note
receivable for $5 million, payable within 12 years from closing. The Company may also receive
contingent payments, up to an aggregate maximum of $25 million, based on the adjusted earnings
before interest and taxes of the Curver business for the five years ending December 31, 2009. Due
to anticipated shortfalls in working capital, the Company does not expect to collect any of the $5
million note receivable. In addition, the Company has not included the contingent payments in the
calculation of the loss on disposal of discontinued operations. In connection with this
transaction, the Company recorded a loss related to the sale of $62.0 million, net of tax, in 2005.
This loss is included in the gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations in the table
above.

FOOTNOTE 4

Restructuring Costs

Project Acceleration Restructuring Activities

In the third quarter of 2005, the Company announced a global initiative referred to as Project
Acceleration aimed at strengthening and transforming the Company’s portfolio. In connection with
Project Acceleration, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a restructuring plan (the
“Plan”) that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Plan is designed to reduce manufacturing
overhead to achieve best cost positions and to allow the Company to increase investment in new
product development, brand building and marketing. Project Acceleration includes the anticipated
closures of approximately one-third of the Company’s 64 manufacturing facilities, thereby
optimizing the Company’s geographic manufacturing footprint. Since the Plan’s inception, the
Company has announced the closure of 16 manufacturing facilities and approximately eight additional
facilities remain to be closed. In total

- 51 -


through December 31, 2007, the Company has recorded $203.7 million of costs related to Project
Acceleration, which excludes restructuring costs associated with discontinued operations. The
Company recorded restructuring costs of $86.0 million and $66.4 million related to Project
Acceleration in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2005, the Company recorded restructuring costs of
$72.6 million, of which $51.3 million related to Project Acceleration and $21.3 million related to
restructuring actions approved prior to the commencement of Project Acceleration (see below for
details). The Plan is expected to result in cumulative restructuring costs over the life of the
initiative of approximately $375 million to $400 million ($315 million to $340 million after tax),
with between $150 million and $160 million ($120 million to $130 million after tax) expected to be
incurred in 2008 (unaudited). Approximately 67% of the cumulative costs are expected to be cash
costs.

During 2006, the Company received a better indication of the value of assets being disposed of in
the Other (Home & Family) segment and also made changes to a disposal group of assets in the former
Cleaning & Organization segment. These assets were previously written down to estimated net
realizable value during the fourth quarter of 2005 as part of Project Acceleration. As a result,
the Company reversed $4.8 million of restructuring costs in 2006 due to a combination of higher
proceeds and changes made to a disposal group of assets.

Project
Acceleration commenced in December 2005 and resulted in non-cash

Pre-Project Acceleration Restructuring Activities

The Company announced a restructuring plan (the “2001 Plan”) in 2001. The specific objectives of
the 2001 Plan were to streamline the Company’s supply chain to become the best-cost global provider
throughout the Company’s portfolio by reducing worldwide headcount and consolidating duplicative
manufacturing facilities. Under the 2001 Plan, the Company exited 84 facilities, of which 31
pertain to discontinued operations, and reduced headcount by approximately 12,000. The Company
recorded $461.7 million in restructuring costs under the 2001 Plan, including $179.2 million for
discontinued operations. Restructuring provisions were determined based on estimates prepared at
the time the specific restructuring actions were approved by management, and also include amounts
recognized as incurred. In 2005, the Company reduced its restructuring reserve by approximately
$5.7 million, primarily as a result of higher proceeds received from the sale of property, plant
and equipment and favorable negotiations on exited contracts. Approximately $1.0 million of
pre-Acceleration restructuring reserves remain as of December 31, 2007. While the accounting
charges associated with the 2001 Plan were completed in the second quarter of 2004, the Company
continued to selectively approve individual restructuring plans. The following table shows the
restructuring costs, net of reversals, recognized under the terms of the 2001 Plan and for the
selective restructuring actions prior to Project Acceleration for the year ended December 31, 2005,

inventories (approximately 59.2% and 59.6% of gross inventory costs at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively) was determined by the LIFO method; for the balance, cost was determined using the
FIFO method. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, LIFO reserves were $40.0 million and $38.1 million,
respectively. The Company recognized a gain (loss) of $3.6 million, ($2.7) million, and $0.1

casualty liabilities such as workers’ compensation, general and product liability and auto
liability and is estimated based upon historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation
methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs.

FOOTNOTE 9

Credit Arrangements

The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that
are available for short-term financing. Borrowings under the Company’s uncommitted lines of credit
are subject to the discretion of the lender. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
notes payable to banks in the amount of $15.3 million and $23.9 million, respectively, with
weighted average interest rates of 10.9% and 6.3%, respectively.

On November 14, 2005, the Company entered into a $750.0 million five-year syndicated revolving
credit facility (the “Revolver”). On an annual basis, the Company may request an extension of the
Revolver (subject to lender approval) for additional one-year periods. The Company elected to
extend the Revolver for additional one-year periods in both October 2006 and October 2007, and, as
a result, the Revolver will now expire in November 2012. All but one lender approved the extension
in 2006. Accordingly, the Company has a $750.0 million facility through November 2010, and a
$725.0 million facility from November 2010 to November 2012. At both December 31, 2007 and 2006,
there were no borrowings under the Revolver.

In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $750.0 million of commercial
paper through 2010 and $725.0 million thereafter, through 2012. The Revolver provides the committed
backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be
issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. The Revolver also provides for
the issuance of up to $100.0 million of standby letters

- 55 -


of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. At
December 31, 2007, there was $197.0 million of commercial paper outstanding and no standby letters
of credit issued under the Revolver. At December 31, 2006, there was no commercial paper
outstanding and there were no standby letters of credit issued under the Revolver.

The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The Revolver
requires, among other things, that the Company maintain certain interest coverage and total
indebtedness to total capital ratios, as defined in the agreement. The Revolver also limits the
amount of indebtedness subsidiaries may incur. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company was
in compliance with the provisions of the agreement governing the Revolver.

The medium-term notes, revolving credit agreement (and related commercial paper), floating rate
note and junior convertible subordinated debentures are all unsecured.

Medium-Term Notes:

In July 1998, the Company issued $250.0 million of medium-term notes. The
notes mature in July 2028 and interest is paid semi-annually. The notes have a coupon rate reset
feature through a remarketing agreement that occurs at two ten year intervals, July 2008 and July
2018. The notes currently have a coupon rate of 6.35% through the first interest reset date of
July 2008. In addition, the notes have an embedded call option pursuant to which a third party may
call the debt at par at each ten-year remarketing interval, and the third party would remarket the
notes if the call option is exercised. Should the call option at each remarketing interval not
be exercised, the note holders are required to put the notes back to the Company at a price of par.
If the third party exercises the call option, remarketing of the notes will occur, which may
result in the Company paying an increased coupon rate in the future.

In July 1998, the Company also issued $75.0 million of medium-term notes. The notes mature in July
2028, and interest is paid semi-annually. The notes have a coupon rate of 6.11%, which is fixed
through maturity. The note

holders have a put option which entitles the holders of the notes to require the Company to repay
the notes at par in July 2008.

The Company has issued three additional series of medium-term notes with aggregate principal
amounts of $250.0 million each. The medium-term notes have coupon rates ranging from 4% to 6.75%
and mature at various dates between 2009 and 2012.

Floating Rate Note:

Under a 2001 receivables facility with a financial institution, the Company
created a financing entity that is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. Under this
facility, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an
undivided interest in substantially all of the Company’s U.S. trade receivables to the financing
entity. In 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt securities to the
financial institution. Certain levels of accounts receivable write-offs and other events would
permit the financial institution to terminate the receivables facility. On September 18, 2006, in
accordance with the terms of the receivables facility, the financing entity caused the preferred
debt securities to be exchanged for cash of $2.2 million, a two year floating rate note in an
aggregate principal amount of $448.0 million and a cash premium of $5.2 million. Because this debt
matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to be short-term at December 31, 2007. At any
time prior to maturity of the note, the holder may elect to convert it into new preferred debt
securities of the financing entity with a par value equal to the outstanding principal amount of
the note. The note must be repaid and any preferred debt securities into which the note is
converted must be retired or redeemed before the Company can have access to the financing entity’s
receivables. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the aggregate amount of outstanding
receivables sold under this facility was $643.3 million and $696.7 million, respectively. The
receivables and the note are recorded in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

Junior Convertible Subordinated Debentures:

In 1997, a 100% owned finance subsidiary (the
“Subsidiary”) of the Company issued 10.0 million shares of 5.25% convertible preferred securities
(the “Preferred Securities”). Holders of the Preferred Securities are entitled to cumulative cash
dividends of 5.25% of the liquidation preference of $50 per Preferred Security, or $2.625 per year.
Each of these Preferred Securities is convertible into 0.9865 of a share of the Company’s common
stock. In 2005 and 2004, the Company purchased 750,000 shares and 825,000 shares, respectively, of
its Preferred Securities from holders at an average price of $47.075 per share ($35.3 million) and
$43.6875 per share ($36.0 million), respectively. As of December 31, 2007, 8.4 million shares of
Preferred Securities were outstanding which were convertible into 8.3 million shares of the
Company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2007, the Company fully and unconditionally guarantees
8.4 million shares of the Preferred Securities issued by the Subsidiary, which are callable at
100.0% of the liquidation preference.

The proceeds received by the Subsidiary from the issuance of the Preferred Securities were invested
in the Company’s 5.25% Junior Convertible Subordinated Debentures (the “Debentures”). In addition,
the Subsidiary received approximately $15.5 million of the Company’s Debentures as payment for a
$15.5 million loan the Company borrowed from the Subsidiary to purchase 100% of the common equity
interests in the Subsidiary. As a result, the Company issued an aggregate of $515.5 million of
Debentures, and the Subsidiary is the sole holder of the Debentures. The Debentures are the sole
assets of the Subsidiary, mature on December 1, 2027, bear interest at an annual rate of 5.25%, are
payable quarterly and became redeemable by the Company beginning in December 2001. The Company may
defer interest payments on the Debentures for a period of up to 20 consecutive quarters, during
which period distribution payments on the Preferred Securities are also deferred. Under this
circumstance, the Company may not declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to its common
or preferred stock or debt securities that do not rank senior to the
Debentures. The Preferred Securities are mandatorily redeemable upon
the repayment of the Debentures at maturity or upon acceleration of
the Debentures. As of December
31, 2007, the Company has not elected to defer interest payments. In connection with the
Company’s purchase of the Preferred Securities in 2005 and 2004, the Company negotiated the early
retirement of the corresponding Debentures with the Subsidiary. The Company accounted for these
transactions as extinguishments of debt, which resulted in $436.7 million of Debentures outstanding
as of December 31, 2007. The Company recorded a net gain of $1.7 million in 2005 associated with
the 2005 purchases of Preferred Securities, which was included in other expense (income), net.

Terminated Interest Rate Swaps:

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying amount of long-term
debt and current maturities thereof includes $8.5 million and $11.9 million (of which $2.0 million
and $3.4 million is classified as current), respectively, relating to terminated interest rate swap
agreements.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Interest
Rate Risk Management:

At December 31, 2007, the Company had interest rate swaps
designated as fair value hedges with an outstanding notional principal amount of $250.0 million,
with a net accrued interest payable of $0.2 million. There was $1.2 million of credit exposure on
the Company’s interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2007.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had long-term cross currency interest rate swaps with an
outstanding notional principal amount of $312.4 million, with a net accrued interest receivable of
$1.7 million. The maturities on these long-term cross currency interest rate swaps are three
years.

Foreign
Currency Management:

The Company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes
hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of generally
one-year duration or less. The following table summarizes the Company’s forward exchange contracts,
long-term cross currency interest rate swaps and option contracts in U.S. dollars by major currency
and contractual amount. The “buy” amounts represent the U.S. equivalent of commitments to purchase
foreign currencies, and the “sell” amounts represent the U.S. equivalent of commitments to sell
foreign currencies according to the local needs of the subsidiaries. The contractual amounts of
significant forward exchange contracts, long-term cross currency interest rate swaps and option
contracts and their fair values as of December 31, were as follows (

Employee Benefit and Retirement Plans

Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS
No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 required the
Company to recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets
and the projected benefit obligations) of its pension plans in the consolidated balance sheet, with
a corresponding adjustment of $32.4 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax.
The adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss at adoption represented the net unrecognized
actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs, and unrecognized transition obligation
remaining from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (SFAS 87).
Further, actuarial gains and losses in subsequent periods that are not recognized as net periodic
pension cost will be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax.
Those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost on the
same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon adoption of SFAS
158. SFAS 158 also requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of
the date of the employer’s fiscal year end statement of financial position beginning December 31,
2008. The Company has historically measured defined benefit plan assets and liabilities for the
majority of its plans on September 30 and has adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158
beginning January 1, 2008. The impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the adoption of
the change in measurement date to December 31 will result in an adjustment to beginning retained
earnings that is not material.

Included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2007 is $314.3 million ($202.4
million net of tax) related to net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service
credit that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension or benefit cost. The Company
expects to recognize $9.8 million ($6.4 million net of tax) of costs in 2008 associated with net
actuarial losses and prior service credit.

Effective December 31, 2004, the Company froze its defined benefit pension plan for its entire
non-union U.S. workforce. As a result of this curtailment, the Company reduced its pension
obligation by $50.3 million and recorded a curtailment gain related to negative prior service cost
in 2005 of $15.8 million. In conjunction with this action, the Company offered special termination
benefits to certain employees who accepted early retirement. The Company replaced the defined
benefit pension plan with an additional defined contribution benefit, whereby the Company will make
additional contributions to the Company sponsored profit sharing plan. The new defined
contribution plan has a three year cliff-vesting schedule, but allows credit for service rendered
prior to the inception of the defined contribution benefit arrangement. The Company recorded $19.9
million, $19.6 million and $21.4 million in expense for the defined contribution benefit
arrangement for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The liability
associated with the defined contribution benefit arrangement as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 is
$19.9 million and $19.6 million, respectively, and is included in other accrued liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company maintained various non-qualified deferred
compensation plans with varying terms. The total liability associated with these plans was $77.8
million and $75.1 million as of

- 59 -


December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These liabilities are included in other noncurrent
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These plans are partially funded with asset
balances of $44.1 million and $38.9 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These
assets are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which is a nonqualified defined
benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key
employees upon retirement based upon the employees’ years of service and compensation. The SERP is
partially funded through a trust agreement with the Northern Trust Company, as trustee, that owns
life insurance policies on key employees. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the life insurance
contracts had a cash surrender value of $78.8 million and $77.7 million, respectively. These
assets are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The projected benefit
obligation was $85.1 million and $78.2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
SERP liabilities are included in the pension table below; however, the Company’s investment in the
life insurance contracts is excluded from the table as they do not qualify as plan assets under
SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.”

The Company and its subsidiaries have noncontributory pension, profit sharing and contributory
401(k) plans covering substantially all of their foreign and domestic employees. Plan benefits are
generally based on years of service and/or compensation. The Company’s funding policy is to
contribute not less than the minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or foreign statutes to
assure that plan assets will be adequate to provide retirement benefits.

The Company’s matching contributions to the contributory 401(k) plans were $15.6 million, $15.9
million, and $15.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company used a September 30 measurement date for the majority of its pension plans in 2007 and
2006. The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded
status of the Company’s noncontributory defined benefit pension plans, including the SERP, as of

The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income
investments is used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded
status, and corporate financial condition. The investment portfolio is comprised of a diversified
blend of equity, real estate, fixed income investments, and cash investments. Equity investments
include large and small market capitalization stocks as well as growth, value and international
stock positions.

The Company employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return for plan
assets. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and
fixed-income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets
with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors, such
as inflation and interest rates, are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are
determined. The long-term portfolio return is established via a building block approach with
proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing. Peer data and historical returns are
reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

The Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately $23.8 million to its defined
benefit pension plans in 2008.

There are no plan assets associated with the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans.

The weighted average discount rate at the measurement dates for the Company’s other postretirement
benefit plans is developed using a spot interest yield curve based upon a broad population of
corporate bonds rated AA or higher, adjusted to match the duration of each plan’s benefits. The

Assumed health care cost trends have been used in the valuation of the benefit obligations for
postretirement benefits. The trend rate used to measure the benefit obligation was 9% for all
retirees in 2007, declining by 0.5% each year to 5% in 2016 and thereafter.

The health care cost trend rate significantly affects the reported postretirement benefit costs and

The convertible preferred securities are anti-dilutive for 2006 and 2005, and therefore have
been excluded from diluted earnings per share. Had the convertible preferred securities been
included in the diluted earnings per share calculation, net income would be increased by $14.2
million and $14.4 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Weighted average shares
outstanding would have increased by 8.3 million shares and 8.4 million shares for 2006 and
2005, respectively.

(2)

Dilutive securities include “in the money options” and restricted stock awards. The
weighted-average shares outstanding for 2007, 2006 and 2005 exclude the effect of
approximately 9.5 million, 11.1 million and 9.6 million stock options, respectively, because
such options were anti-dilutive.

FOOTNOTE 15

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company offers stock-based compensation to its employees that includes stock options,
restricted stock awards, performance share awards and an employee stock purchase plan, as follows:

Stock Options

The Company’s stock plans include plans adopted in 1993 and 2003. The Company has issued both
non-qualified and incentive stock options at exercise prices equal to the Company’s common stock
price on the date of grant with contractual terms of ten years that generally vest and are expensed
ratably over five years. Stock option grants are generally subject to forfeiture if employment
terminates prior to vesting.

Restricted Stock

Restricted stock awards are independent of stock option grants and are subject to forfeiture if
employment terminates prior to vesting. The awards generally cliff-vest three years from the date
of grant. Prior to vesting, ownership of the shares cannot be transferred. The restricted stock
has the same dividend and voting rights as the common stock. The Company expenses the cost of
these awards ratably over the vesting period.

Performance Shares

Performance share awards issued under the 2003 Stock Plan represent the right to receive
unrestricted shares of stock based on the achievement of Company performance objectives and/or
individual performance goals established by the Organizational Development & Compensation Committee
and the Board of Directors. The

- 64 -


Company awarded performance shares in February 2007 based on 2006 performance and awarded
performance shares in 2006 related to a transition grant as the Company moved to a new cash bonus
structure.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) effective August 1, 2006. The ESPP
allows all employees the ability to purchase shares of the Company’s $1.00 par value per share
common stock at a 5% discount at the end of each quarter. Pursuant to the ESPP, $0.9 million of
shares were purchased during 2007.

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense by applying the
intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25. Under APB 25, the Company generally recognized
compensation expense only for restricted stock grants. The Company recognized the compensation
expense associated with the restricted stock ratably over the associated service period.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified
prospective transition method, and therefore has not restated the results of prior periods. Under
this transition method, stock-based compensation expense for 2007 and 2006 includes (i)
compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted prior to, but not yet vested
as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and (ii) compensation
expense for all share-based payment awards granted after January 1, 2006 based on estimated
grant-date fair values estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R).

Income Taxes

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not
result in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. However, the adoption of FIN 48 did result
in the reclassification of certain income tax assets and liabilities from current to long-term in
the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

As of January 1, 2007, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $161.8 million, of which $160.7
million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2007, the Company
had unrecognized tax benefits of $145.8 million, all of which, if recognized, would affect the
effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized
tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007, the
Company had recorded accrued interest expense related to the
unrecognized tax benefits of up to $18.6
million and $12.6 million, respectively. Due to statute expirations and examinations by various
worldwide taxing authorities, $18.8 million of the unrecognized tax benefits could reasonably
change in the coming year.

tax benefits, including interest, is as follows (

The Company files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal
jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for the
Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns has expired for years prior to 2004, and the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examination of the Company’s 2004 federal income tax
return. The Company’s Canadian income tax returns are subject to examination for years after 2000.
With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to other income tax examinations for years
before 2004.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had foreign net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of
approximately $619.5 million, most of which carryforward without expiration. The potential tax
benefits associated with those foreign NOLs are approximately $201.8 million. The valuation
allowance on NOLs decreased $10.1 million during 2007 to $199.8 million at December 31, 2007. This
decrease is primarily due to foreign NOLs utilized during the year.

Resolution of Tax Contingencies


In 2007, the Company recorded a benefit of $35.0 million due to the Company entering into an
agreement with the IRS relating to the appropriate treatment of a specific deduction included in
the Company’s 2006 U.S. federal income tax return. The Company requested accelerated review of the
transaction under the IRS’ Pre-Filing Agreement Program that resulted in affirmative resolution in
2007.

The Company recorded a $4.4 million net benefit due to certain accrual reversals for which the
statute of limitations has expired partially offset by provisions required for tax deductions
recorded in prior periods.

The Company recorded a benefit of $1.9 million due to the receipt of an income tax refund,
resulting in a reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.


In 2006, the Company determined that it would be able to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards
that it previously believed would expire unused. Accordingly, the Company reversed an income tax
valuation reserve of $3.6 million.

The Company completed the reorganization of certain legal entities in Europe which resulted in the
recognition of an income tax benefit of $78.0 million.

In 2006, the statute of limitations on certain tax positions for which the Company had provided tax
reserves, in whole or in part, expired resulting in the reversal of the provisions and interest
accrued thereon in the amount of $21.2 million.


In January 2005, the Company reached agreement with the IRS relating to the appropriate treatment
of a specific deduction included in the Company’s 2003 U.S. federal income tax return. The Company
requested accelerated review of the transaction under the IRS’ Pre-Filing Agreement Program that
resulted in affirmative resolution in late January 2005. A $58.6 million benefit was recorded in
income taxes for 2005 related to this issue.

In 2005, the statute of limitations on certain tax positions for which the Company had provided tax
reserves, in whole or in part, expired resulting in the reversal of the provisions and interest
accrued thereon in the amount of $15.3 million.

FOOTNOTE 19

Litigation and Contingencies

The Company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. These
proceedings include claims for damages arising out of use of the Company’s products, allegations of
infringement of intellectual property, commercial disputes and employment matters as well as
environmental matters described below. Some of

- 71 -


the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages, and certain
proceedings purport to be class actions.

The Company, using current product sales data and historical trends, actuarially calculates the
estimate of its exposure for product liability. As a result of the most recent analysis, the
Company has product liability reserves of $34.4 million as of December 31, 2007. The Company is
insured for product liability claims for amounts in excess of established deductibles and accrues
for the estimated liability as described up to the limits of the deductibles. All other claims and
lawsuits are handled on a case-by-case basis.

On July 1, 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interest of PSI System, Inc.
(“Endicia”), provider of Endicia Internet Postage, for $51.2
million plus related acquisition costs and contingent payments of up
to $25.0 million based on future revenues. Endicia is party to a
lawsuit filed against it alleging patent infringement. In this case,
Stamps.com seeks injunctive relief in order to prevent Endicia from
continuing to engage in activities that are alleged to infringe on
Stamps.com’s patents. An unfavorable outcome in this litigation,
which management does not believe is probable, could materially
adversely affect the Endicia business.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company was involved in various matters concerning federal and state
environmental laws and regulations, including matters in which the Company has been identified by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies as a potentially
responsible party (“PRP”) at contaminated sites under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and equivalent state laws.

In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has considered several factors,
including the extent of the Company’s volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of
other PRPs; the kind of waste; the terms of existing cost sharing and other applicable agreements;
the financial ability of other PRPs to share in the payment of requisite costs; the Company’s prior
experience with similar sites; environmental studies and cost estimates available to the Company;
the effects of inflation on cost estimates; and the extent to which the Company’s, and other
parties’, status as PRPs is disputed.

The Company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of December
31, 2007 ranged between $14.5 million and $33.9 million. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had
a reserve equal to $18.8 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate, which is
included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. No insurance recovery was taken into account in determining the Company’s cost estimates
or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present
value purposes, except with respect to four long-term (30 year) operations and maintenance CERCLA
matters which are estimated at their present value of $8.6 million.

Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and response activities,
the possibility that the Company could be identified as a PRP at sites identified in the future
that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the possibility that sites acquired
in business combinations may require environmental response costs, actual costs to be incurred by
the Company may vary from the Company’s estimates.

Although management of the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings
with certainty, including the items discussed above, it believes that the ultimate resolution of
the Company’s legal proceedings, including any amounts it may be required to pay in excess of
amounts reserved, will not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In the normal course of business and as part of its acquisition and divestiture strategy, the
Company may provide certain representations and indemnifications related to legal, environmental,
product liability, tax or other types of issues. Based on the nature of these representations and
indemnifications, it is not possible to predict the maximum potential payments under all of these
agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and
circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company
under these agreements did not have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial
condition or results of operations.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $87.6 million in standby letters of credit primarily
related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product
liability, and medical.

FOOTNOTE 20

Subsequent Events

On February 21, 2008, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all
of the assets of Aprica Childcare Institute Aprica Kassai, Inc. (“Aprica”), a leading maker of
strollers, car seats and other children’s products, headquartered in Osaka, Japan. Complementing
the Company’s Graco brand and its recent acquisition of

- 72 -


Germany’s Teutonia, the addition of Aprica would give the Company strong brands and distribution
channels in Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. For the most recent fiscal year ended July 31,
2007, Aprica reported net sales of approximately $122 million (unaudited). The transaction, which
is subject to certain customary and other closing conditions, is expected to close in the first
half of 2008.

On February 27, 2008, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement
to acquire Technical Concepts Holdings, LLC, (“Technical
Concepts”), a leading global provider of innovative hygiene
systems for several high-growth segments of the away-from-home
washroom category for approximately $445 million, subject to
post-closing adjustments for working capital and other matters. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
Technical Concepts reported net sales of approximately $137 million
(unaudited). The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval
and customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the first
half of 2008.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of December 31, 2007, an
evaluation was performed by the Company’s management, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the
effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that
evaluation, the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Company’s
management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth under
Item 8 of this annual report and is incorporated herein by reference.

(c)

Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The
attestation report of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public
accounting firm, on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is set forth
under Item 8 of this annual report and is incorporated herein by reference.

(d)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The internal control over
financial reporting at the Company’s North American Office Products business changed during
the quarter ended December 31, 2007 due to the implementation of SAP. The implementation
was successful and did not have an adverse effect on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. There were no other material changes in internal control over
financial reporting at the Company’s other businesses that occurred during the quarter
ended December 31, 2007. The implementation of SAP at the Company’s North American Office
Products business is the first step in the Company’s plan to replace various business
information systems worldwide with an enterprise resource planning system from SAP.
Implementation will continue to occur over several years in phases, primarily based on
geographic region and segment. This activity involves the migration of multiple legacy
systems and users to a common SAP information platform. In addition, this conversion will
impact certain interfaces with the Company’s customers and suppliers, resulting in changes
to the tools the Company uses to take orders, procure material, schedule production, remit
billings, make payments and perform other business functions.

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

Separation Agreement and General Release with Steven G. Marton

On February 28, 2008, the Company entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release (the “Separation Agreement”) with Steven G. Marton, President, Special Assignments, whereby his employment with the Company ended.  A copy of the Separation Agreement is attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 10.25 and incorporated herein by reference.

The material terms of the Separation
Agreement are as follows: (i) base salary continuation for 52 weeks which may be extended up to an
additional 26 weeks, or until Mr. Marton finds alternative employment whichever comes first (such
salary continuation period may be extended up to an additional 4 weeks); (ii) in the event Mr.
Marton finds alternative employment during the salary continuation period, payment of the
remaining value attributable to the first 52 weeks of the salary continuation period, plus a
lump sum payment equal to 50% of the value remaining with respect to the 26 week salary
continuation period; (iii) continued coverage under the Company’s health and dental programs

residence provided that (A) the sale of the residence occurs prior to his acceptance
of alternative employment, or (B) if the sale occurs after his acceptance of alternative
employment, any loss is not reimbursed by that employer’s policy or practice. The Separation
Agreement does not affect any vested rights Mr. Marton has in the Company’s Management Bonus
Plan, deferred compensation plans, pension plan or 401(k) plan.

Until February 28, 2010, Mr. Marton is prohibited from competing in the US with the Company’s Office Products business, from soliciting or hiring certain Company employees and from soliciting certain customers and suppliers of the Company.

already paid to him and to obtain all other relief provided by law or equity.  The Separation
Agreement also contains a release of claims provision.  Mr. Marton has seven days in which to
revoke his acceptance of the Separation Agreement.  If he does not revoke his acceptance, the
Separation Agreement shall become effective the day after the seven day revocation period.
