   NET SALES BY BUSINESS SEGMENT
   -----------------------------

        The following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of the
   Company's net sales for the three years ended December 31 (including
   sales of acquired businesses from the time of acquisition and sales of
   divested businesses through date of sale), for the Company's six
   business segments. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries
   amounted to approximately 15% of consolidated net sales in 2000 and
   1999, and 14% in 1998.  Sales to no other customer exceeded 10% of
   consolidated net sales.

[CAPTION]










   Certain 1999 and 1998 amounts have been reclassified to conform with
   the 2000 presentation.

   EXPORT SALES
   ------------

        The Company's export sales business, defined as sales of products
   made in the U.S. and sold abroad, is conducted primarily through its
   Newell International division.  For purposes of the table immediately
   above, sales attributable to the Newell International division are
   allocated to the business segment that manufactured the products.

                               GROWTH STRATEGY
                               ---------------

        The Company's growth strategy emphasizes internal growth and
   acquisitions.  The Company has grown internally principally by
   introducing new products, entering new domestic and international
   markets, adding new customers, cross-selling existing product lines to
   current customers and supporting its U.S.-based customers'
   international expansion.  The Company has supplemented internal
   growth, both domestically and internationally, by acquiring businesses
   with brand name product lines and improving the profitability of such
   businesses through an integration process referred to as
   "Newellization."  Since 1990, the Company has completed more than 20
   major acquisitions (excluding Rubbermaid) representing more than $3
   billion in additional sales.

   Internal Growth
   ---------------

        An important element of the Company's growth strategy is internal
   growth.  Internal growth is accomplished through introducing new
   products, entering new domestic and international markets, adding new
   customers, cross-selling existing product lines to current customers
   and supporting its U.S.-based customers' international expansion.
   Internal growth is defined by the Company as growth from its "core
   businesses," which include continuing businesses owned more than two
   years and minor acquisitions.  The Company's goal is to achieve above-
   average internal growth.

   ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION
   ----------------------------

        ACQUISITION STRATEGY
        --------------------

        The Company supplements internal growth by acquiring businesses
   and product lines with a strategic fit with the Company's existing
   businesses.  It also seeks to acquire product lines with a number one
   or two position in the markets in which they compete, [USER BRANDS], a
   low technology level, a long product life cycle and the potential to






   reach the Company's standard of profitability.  In addition to adding
   entirely new product lines, the Company uses acquisitions to round out
   existing businesses and fill gaps in its product offering, add new
   customers and distribution channels, expand shelf space for the
   Company's products with existing customers, and improve operational
   efficiency through shared resources.  The Company intends to continue
   to pursue acquisition opportunities to complement internal growth.

        NEWELLIZATION
        -------------

        "Newellization" is the Company's well-established profit
   improvement and productivity enhancement process that is applied to
   integrate newly acquired product lines.  The Newellization process
   includes establishing a more focused business strategy, improving
   customer service, reducing corporate overhead through centralization
   of administrative functions and tightening financial controls.  In
   integrating acquired businesses, the Company typically centralizes
   accounting systems, capital expenditure approval, cash management,
   order processing, billing, credit, accounts receivable and data
   processing operations.  To enhance efficiency, Newellization also
   focuses on improving manufacturing processes, eliminating
   non-productive lines, reducing inventories, increasing accounts
   receivable turnover, extending accounts payable terms and trimming
   excess costs.  The Newellization process usually takes approximately
   two to three years to complete.

   Selective Globalization
   -----------------------

        The Company is pursuing selective international opportunities to
   further its internal growth and acquisition objectives.  The rapid
   growth of consumer goods economies and retail structures in several
   regions outside the U.S., particularly Europe, Mexico and South
   America, makes them attractive to the Company by providing selective
   opportunities to acquire businesses, develop partnerships with new
   foreign customers and extend relationships with the Company's domestic
   customers whose businesses are growing internationally.  The Company's
   recent acquisitions, combined with existing sales to foreign
   customers, increased its sales outside the U.S. to approximately 25%
   of total sales in 2000 from 23% in 1999 and 22% in 1998.

        Additional information regarding acquisitions of businesses is
   included in Item 6 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial
   statements.













                         MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
                         --------------------------

   CUSTOMER SERVICE
   ----------------

        The Company believes that one of the primary ways it
   distinguishes itself from its competitors is through customer service.
   The Company's ability to provide superior customer service is a result
   of its information technology, marketing and merchandising programs
   designed to enhance the sales and profitability of its customers and
   consistent on-time delivery of its products.

   Information Technology
   ----------------------

        The Company is an industry leader in the application of
   Electronic Data Interchange ("EDI") technology, an electronic link
   between the Company and many of its retail customers and invests in
   advanced computer systems.  The Company uses EDI to receive and
   transmit purchase orders, invoices and payments.  With the replacement
   of paper-based processing with computer-to-computer business
   transactions, EDI has cut days off the order/shipping cycle.

        Building upon its EDI expertise, the Company has established
   "Quick Response" programs with several major customers.  These
   programs allow the Company to implement customized features such as
   vendor-managed inventories in which the Company manages certain or all
   aspects of inventory of several product categories at customer
   locations.  The Company's experience is that its customers benefit
   from such programs by increased inventory turnover and reduced
   customer waiting periods for out-of-stock product.

   On-Time Delivery
   ----------------

        A critical element of the Company's customer service is
   consistent on-time delivery of products to its customers.  Retailers
   are pursuing a number of strategies to deliver the highest-quality,
   lowest-cost products to their customers.  A growing trend among
   retailers is to purchase on a "just-in-time" basis in order to reduce
   inventory costs and increase returns on investment.  As retailers
   shorten their lead times for orders, manufacturers need to more
   closely anticipate consumer buying patterns.  The Company supports its
   retail customers' "just-in-time" inventory strategies through
   investments in improved forecasting systems, more responsive
   manufacturing and distribution capabilities and electronic
   communications.  The Company manufactures the vast majority of its
   products and has extensive experience in high-volume, cost-effective
   manufacturing.  The high-volume nature of its manufacturing processes
   and the relatively consistent demand for its products enables the
   Company to ship most products directly from its factories without the






   need for independent warehousing and distribution centers.  For 2000,
   approximately 98% of the items ordered by customers were shipped on
   time, typically within two to three days of the customer's order.

   Marketing
   ---------

        The Company's objective is to develop long-term, mutually
   beneficial partnerships with its customers and become their supplier
   of choice.  To achieve this goal, the Company has a value-added
   marketing program that offers a family of leading brand name staple
   products, tailored sales programs, innovative merchandising support,
   in-store services and responsive top management.

        The Company's marketing skills help customers stimulate store
   traffic and sales through timely advertising and innovative
   promotions.  The Company also assists customers in differentiating
   their offerings by customizing products and packaging.  Through
   self-selling packaging and displays that emphasize good-better-best
   value relationships, retail customers are encouraged to trade up to
   higher-value, best quality products.

        Customer service also involves customer contact with top-level
   decision makers at the Company's divisions.  As part of its
   decentralized structure, the Company's division presidents are the
   chief marketing officers of their product lines and communicate
   directly with customers.  This structure permits early recognition of
   market trends and timely response to customer problems.

   Multi-Product Offering
   ----------------------

        The Company's increasingly broad product coverage in multiple
   product lines permits it to more effectively meet the needs of its
   customers.  With families of leading, brand name products and
   profitable new products, the Company also can help volume purchasers
   sell a more profitable product mix.  As a potential single source for
   an entire product line, the Company can use program merchandising to
   improve product presentation, optimize display space for both sales
   and income and encourage impulse buying by retail customers.

   Corporate Structure
   -------------------

        By decentralizing its manufacturing and marketing efforts while
   centralizing key administrative functions, the Company seeks to foster
   a responsive entrepreneurial culture.  The Company's divisions
   concentrate on designing, manufacturing, marketing, selling their
   products and servicing their customers, which facilitates product
   development and responsiveness to customers.  Administrative functions
   that are centralized at the corporate level include cash management,
   accounting systems, capital expenditure approvals, order processing,






   billing, credit, accounts receivable, data processing operations and
   legal functions.  Centralization concentrates technical expertise in
   one location, making it easier to observe overall business trends and
   manage the Company's businesses.

   Backlog
   -------

        The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.

   Seasonal Variations
   -------------------

        The Company's product groups are only moderately affected by
   seasonal trends.  The Storage, Organization & Cleaning,
   Infant/Juvenile Care & Play and Food Preparation, Cooking & Serving
   business segments typically have higher sales in the second half of
   the year due to retail stocking related to the holiday season; the
   Home Decor and Hardware & Tools business segments have higher sales in
   the second and third quarters due to an increased level of
   do-it-yourself projects completed in the summer months; and the Office
   Product business segment has higher sales in the second and third
   quarters due to the back-to-school season.  Because these seasonal
   trends are moderate, the Company's consolidated quarterly sales do not
   fluctuate significantly, unless a significant acquisition is made.

   Foreign Operations
   ------------------

        Information regarding the Company's 2000, 1999 and 1998 foreign
   operations is included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial
   statements and is incorporated by reference herein.

   Raw Materials
   -------------

        The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply
   for substantially all of its material requirements.  The raw materials
   and various purchased components required for its products have
   generally been available in sufficient quantities.

   Patents and Trademarks
   ----------------------

        The Company has many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade
   names, none of which is considered material to the consolidated
   operations.

   Competition
   -----------
        The Company competes with numerous other manufacturers and
   distributors of consumer products, many of which are large and






   well-established.  The Company's principal customers are large mass
   merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs
   and office superstores.  The rapid growth of these large mass
   merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns,
   have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer
   products retail industry and the formation of dominant multi-category
   retailers, many of which have strong bargaining power with suppliers.
   This environment significantly limits the Company's ability to recover
   cost increases through selling prices.  Other trends among retailers
   are to foster high levels of competition among suppliers, to demand
   that manufacturers supply innovative new products and to require
   suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products
   with shorter lead times.  Another trend, in the absence of a strong
   new product development effort or strong end-user brands, is for the
   retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources.
   The combination of these market influences has created an intensely
   competitive environment in which the Company's principal customers
   continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in
   pricing pressures and the need for strong end-user brands, the ongoing
   introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in
   customer service.

        For more than 30 years, the Company has positioned itself to
   respond to the challenges of this retail environment by developing
   strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers.  The Company
   markets its strong multi-product offering through virtually every
   category of high-volume retailer, including discount, drug, grocery
   and variety chains, warehouse clubs, department, hardware and
   specialty stores, home centers, office superstores, contract
   stationers and military exchanges.  The Company's largest customer,
   Wal-Mart (including Sam's Club), accounted for approximately 15% of
   net sales in 2000.  Other top ten customers included Toys 'R Us, The
   Home Depot, Kmart, Target, Lowe's, The Office Depot, JCPenney, United
   Stationers, and Sears.

        The Company's other principal methods of meeting its competitive
   challenges are high brand name recognition, superior customer service
   (including industry leading information technology, innovative
   "good-better-best" marketing and merchandising programs), consistent
   on-time delivery, decentralized manufacturing and marketing,
   centralized administration, and experienced management.

        Net sales for 2000 were $6,934.7 million, representing an
   increase of $222.9 million or 3.3% from $6,711.8 million in 1999. Net
   sales for each of the Company's segments (and the primary reasons for
   the year-to-year changes) were as follows, in millions:








   YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                   2000      1999    % Change

                                           =======   =======


   PRIMARY REASONS FOR CHANGES:

     4% internal growth* plus sales from the Reynolds acquisition+
        (October 1999).

     Internal growth.

     6% internal growth plus sales from the McKechnie acquisition
        (October 1999).

   *    Internal growth is defined by the Company as growth from its core
        businesses, which include continuing businesses owned more than
        two years and minor acquisitions.

   +    Acquisitions and divestitures are described in note 2 to the
        consolidated financial statements.

        Gross income as a percent of net sales in 2000 was 26.4% or
   $1,831.6 million versus 25.9% or $1,741.2 million in 1999. Excluding
   costs associated with the Rubbermaid merger and certain realignment
   and other charges of $2.4 million and $106.2 million in 2000 and 1999,
   respectively, gross income as a percent of net sales was 26.4% in 2000
   versus 27.5% in 1999. This decrease in gross margins in 2000 was
   primarily attributable to lower than anticipated sales volume and
   higher than expected material costs.

        Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in 2000
   were 13.0% of net sales or $899.4 million versus 16.4% or $1,104.5 in
   1999. Excluding costs associated with the Rubbermaid merger and
   certain realignment and other charges of $8.7 million and $178.8
   million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, SG&A as a percent of net sales
   was 12.8% or $890.7 million in 2000 versus 13.8% or $925.6 million in
   1999. The decrease in SG&A expenses is primarily the result of
   integration cost savings at Rubbermaid Home Products, Rubbermaid
   Europe and Little Tikes and tight spending control throughout the rest
   of the Company's core businesses.








        The Company recorded restructuring charges of $48.6 million in
   2000 and $246.4 million in 1999.  See note 3 to the consolidated
   financial statements for a review of the charges.

        Goodwill amortization and other as a percentage of net sales was
   0.7% in 2000 and 1999.

        Operating income in 2000 was 12.0% of net sales or $831.7 million
   versus 5.1% of net sales or $343.6 million in 1999. Excluding
   restructuring and other charges of $59.7 million in 2000 and $531.4
   million in 1999, operating income was $891.4 or 12.9% of net sales in
   2000 versus $875.0 million or 13.0% of net sales in 1999.

        Other nonoperating expenses in 2000 were 2.1% of net sales or
   $146.2 million versus 1.7% or $112.7 million in 1999. The increased
   expenses in 2000 are a result of the Company's increased level of debt
   and higher interest rates.

        For 2000 and 1999 the effective tax rates were 38.5% and 58.7%,
   respectively. The higher rate in 1999 was primarily due to
   nondeductible transaction costs associated with the Rubbermaid merger.
   See note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for an
   explanation of the effective tax rate.

        Net income for 2000 was $421.6 million, representing an increase
   of $326.2 million from 1999. Basic and diluted earnings per share in
   2000 increased to $1.57 versus $0.34 in 1999. Excluding 2000 pre-tax
   charges of $59.7 million ($36.7 million after taxes) as discussed
   above, net income in 2000 was $458.3 million. Excluding 1999 pre-tax
   charges of $531.4 million ($369.6 million after taxes), net income in
   1999 was $465.0 million. Diluted earnings per share, calculated on the
   same basis, increased 3.6% to $1.71 in 2000 versus $1.65 in 1999. The
   decrease in net income for 2000 was primarily due to increased raw
   material costs and softer than expected sales volume, offset partially
   by Rubbermaid integration cost savings, tight spending control at
   other core businesses and internal growth. Diluted earnings per share
   increased in 2000 versus 1999 as a result of the lower share base due
   to the stock repurchase program.


   1999 vs. 1998
   -------------

        Net sales for 1999 were $6,711.8 million, representing an
   increase of $218.6 million or 3.4% from $6,493.2 million in 1998. Net
   sales for each of the Company's segments (and the primary reasons for
   the year-to-year changes) were as follows, in millions:

   PRIMARY REASONS FOR CHANGES:

     1998 Decora (April 1998) and Newell Plastics (September 1998)
        divestitures and weak sales performance at Rubbermaid Home
        Products, offset partially by strong sales at Rubbermaid
        Commercial Products.
     Swish (March 1998), Gardinia (August 1998) and Ateliers (April
        1999) acquisitions.
     7% Internal growth and Rotring (September 1998) and Reynolds
        (October 1999) acquisitions offset partially by Stuart Hall
        (August 1998) divestiture.
     Century (May 1998) acquisition.

        Gross income as a percent of net sales in 1999 was 25.9% or
   $1,741.2 million versus 28.1% or $1,822.8 million in 1998. Excluding
   costs associated with the Rubbermaid and Calphalon mergers and certain
   realignment and other charges of $106.2 million and $27.9 million in
   1999 and 1998, respectively, gross income as a percent of net sales
   was 27.5% in 1999 versus 28.5% in 1998. This decrease in gross margins
   in 1999 was primarily attributable to promotional commitments made
   prior to the Rubbermaid merger, which affected first half 1999 results
   at Rubbermaid Home Products, higher than expected resin and other
   material costs, which affected second half 1999 results, and operating
   inefficiencies at certain glassware and window treatments facilities.

        Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in 1999
   were 16.4% of net sales or $1,104.5 million versus 14.9% or $967.9
   million in 1998. Excluding costs associated with the Rubbermaid and
   Calphalon mergers and certain realignment and other charges of $178.8
   million and $23.6 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively, SG&A as a
   percent of net sales was 13.8% or $925.7 million versus 14.5% or
   $944.3 million in 1998. This decrease in SG&A expenses is primarily
   due to SG&A savings as a result of integrating Rubbermaid into Newell.

        The Company recorded restructuring charges of $246.4 million in
   1999 and $115.2 million in 1998. See note 3 to the consolidated
   financial statements for a review of the charges.

        Goodwill amortization and other as a percentage of net sales was
   0.7% in 1999 and 0.9% in 1998. Excluding charges of $15.0 million in







   1998 (which included write-offs of intangible assets), goodwill
   amortization and other was 0.7% of net sales.

        Operating income in 1999 was 5.1% of net sales or $343.6 million
   versus 10.5% or $680.3 million in 1998. Excluding charges as discussed
   above of $531.4 million in 1999 and $181.7 million 1998, operating
   income was $875.0 million or 13.0% in 1999 versus $862.0 million or
   13.3% in 1998.

        Other nonoperating expenses in 1999 were 1.7% of net sales or
   $112.7 million versus other nonoperating income of 2.1% or $136.6
   million in 1998. The $249.3 million difference was due primarily to a
   1998 net pre-tax gain of $191.5 million on the sale of the Company's
   stake in The Black & Decker Corporation and 1998 net pre-tax gains of
   $59.8 million on the divestitures of Stuart Hall, Newell Plastics and
   Decora. This was offset partially by $3.7 million of Rubbermaid merger
   transaction costs in 1998.

        For 1999 and 1998, the effective tax rates were 58.7% and 41.0%,
   respectively. The increase in 1999 was primarily due to nondeductible
   transaction costs related to the Rubbermaid merger. See note 12 to the
   consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the effective
   tax rate.

        Net income for 1999 was $95.4 million, representing a decrease of
   $386.4 million or 80.2% from 1998. Basic earnings per share in 1999
   decreased 80.2% to $0.34 versus $1.72 in 1998; diluted earnings per
   share in 1999 decreased 80.0% to $0.34 versus $1.70 in 1998. Excluding
   1999 pre-tax charges of $531.4 million ($369.6 million after taxes) as
   discussed above, net income in 1999 was $465.0 million. Excluding 1998
   pre-tax charges of $185.4 million ($119.4 million after taxes), the
   net pre-tax gain on the sale of Black & Decker Common Stock of $191.5
   million ($116.8 million after taxes) and net pre-tax gains of $59.8
   million ($15.1 million after taxes) on the sales of businesses as
   discussed above, net income in 1998 was $469.3 million.


   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

   Sources
   -------

        The Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital resources
   include cash provided from operations and use of available borrowing
   facilities.

        Cash provided by operating activities in 2000 was $623.5 million,
   representing an increase of $69.5 million from $554.0 million for
   1999.

        The Company has short-term foreign and domestic committed and
   uncommitted lines of credit with various banks which are available for






   short-term financing. Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines
   of credit are subject to discretion of the lender. The Company's lines
   of credit do not have a material impact on the Company's liquidity.
   Borrowings under the Company's lines of credit at December 31, 2000
   totaled $23.5 million.

        The Company has a revolving credit agreement of $1,300.0 million
   that will terminate in August 2002. During 2000, the Company entered
   into a new 364-day revolving credit agreement in the amount of $700.0
   million. This revolving credit agreement will terminate in October
   2001. At December 31, 2000, there were no borrowings under these
   revolving credit agreements.

        In lieu of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit
   agreements, the Company may issue up to $2,000.0 million of commercial
   paper. The Company's revolving credit agreements provide the committed
   backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly,
   commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for
   borrowing under the Company's revolving credit agreements. At December
   31, 2000, $1,503.7 million (principal amount) of commercial paper was
   outstanding. Of this amount, $1,300.0 million is classified as
   long-term debt and the remaining $203.7 million is classified as
   current portion of long-term debt.

        The revolving credit agreements permit the Company to borrow
   funds on a variety of interest rate terms. These agreements require,
   among other things, that the Company maintain a certain Total
   Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreements. As
   of December 31, 2000, the Company was in compliance with these
   agreements.

        The Company had outstanding at December 31, 2000 a total of
   $1,012.5 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes. The
   maturities on these notes range from 3 to 30 years at an average
   interest rate of 6.34%.

        A universal shelf registration statement became effective in July
   1999. As of December 31, 2000, $449.5 million of Company debt and
   equity securities may be issued under the shelf.

   Uses
   ----

        The Company's primary uses of liquidity and capital resources
   include acquisitions, dividend payments and capital expenditures.

        In 2000, the Company acquired Mersch, Brio and Paper Mate/Parker
   and made other minor acquisitions for cash purchase prices totaling
   $582.7 million. In 1999, the Company acquired Ateliers, Reynolds,
   McKechnie, Ceanothe and made other minor acquisitions for cash
   purchase prices totaling $400.1 million. In 1998, the Company acquired







   Curver, Swish, Century, Panex, Gardinia and Rotring and made other
   minor acquisitions for cash purchase prices totaling $615.7 million.

        Capital expenditures were $316.6 million, $200.1 million and
   $318.7 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Aggregate
   dividends paid during 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $225.1 million, $225.8
   million and $212.5 million, respectively.

        On February 7, 2000, the Company announced a stock repurchase
   program of up to $500.0 million of the Company's outstanding Common
   Stock. During 2000, the Company repurchased 15.5 million shares of its
   Common Stock at an average price of $26 per share, for a total cash
   price of $403.0 million under the program. The repurchase program
   remained in effect until December 31, 2000 and was financed through
   the use of working capital and commercial paper.

        Retained earnings increased in 2000 by $196.3 million and
   decreased in 1999 by $130.5 million. The difference between 2000 and
   1999 was primarily due to restructuring costs and other pre-tax
   charges relating to recent acquisitions of $59.7 million ($36.7
   million after tax) in 2000 versus $531.4 million ($369.6 million after
   tax) in 1999. The dividend payout ratio to common stockholders in
   2000, 1999 and 1998 was 54%, 235%, and 45%, respectively (represents
   the percentage of diluted earnings per share paid in cash to
   stockholders).

        Working capital at December 31, 2000 was $1,345.8 million
   compared to $1,108.7 million at December 31, 1999 and $1,278.8 million
   at December 31, 1998. The current ratio at December 31, 2000 was
   1.87:1 compared to 1.68:1 at December 31, 1999 and 2.09:1 at December
   31, 1998.

        Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and
   cash equivalents, and total capitalization includes total debt,
   company-obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred
   securities of a subsidiary trust and stockholders' equity) was .46:1
   at December 31, 2000, .33:1 at December 31, 1999 and .30:1 at December
   31, 1998.

        The Company believes that cash provided from operations and
   available borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate
   support for the cash needs of existing businesses; however, certain
   events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional
   external financing.

   LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

        The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims,
   including various environmental matters, that have arisen in the
   ordinary conduct of its business or have been assumed by the Company
   when it purchased certain businesses. Such matters are more fully
   described in note 15 to the Company's consolidated financial






   statements. Although management of the Company cannot predict the
   ultimate outcome of these matters with certainty, it believes that
   their ultimate resolution, including any amounts it may have to pay in
   excess of amounts reserved, will not have a material effect on the
   Company's consolidated financial statements.

   INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

        The Company's non-U.S. business is growing at a faster pace than
   its business in the United States. This growth outside the U.S. has
   been fueled by recent international acquisitions, primarily in Europe.
   For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company's non-U. S. business
   accounted for approximately 25% of net sales (see note 14 to the
   consolidated financial statements). Growth of both U.S. and non-U.S.
   businesses is shown below:

   MARKET RISK

        The Company's market risk is impacted by changes in interest
   rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices.
   Pursuant to the Company's policies, natural hedging techniques and
   derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact
   of adverse changes in market prices. The Company does not hold or
   issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.

        The Company's primary market risk is interest rate exposure,
   primarily in the United States. The Company manages interest rate
   exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of






   fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate exposure was reduced
   significantly in 1997 from the issuance of $500.0 million 5.25%
   Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred
   Securities of a Subsidiary Trust, the proceeds of which reduced
   commercial paper. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest
   rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for
   qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in
   interest expense.

        The Company's foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes
   hedging anticipated intercompany and third-party commercial
   transaction exposures of one year duration or less. The Company
   focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form:

        *    offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows,

        *    structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with
             appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net
             investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion
             risk,

        *    converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S.
             dollars or the relevant functional currency and

        *    avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the
             appropriate functional currency.

        In addition, the Company utilizes forward contracts and purchased
   options to hedge commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and
   losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany
   transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying
   transactions. Derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked
   to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the
   consolidated statements of income.

        Due to the diversity of its product lines, the Company  does not
   have material sensitivity to any one commodity. The Company manages
   commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of
   its vendor contracts.

        The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential
   economic loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in
   either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the
   value-at-risk estimation model. The value-at-risk model uses
   historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the
   volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It
   estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling
   techniques and including substantially all market risk exposures
   (specifically excluding equity-method investments). The fair value
   losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of
   operations or financial condition as they represent economic not
   financial losses.






                                            Time       Confidence
                                Amount     Period        Level
                                ------     ------      ----------

    (In millions)
    Interest rates              $7.4       1 day         95%
    Foreign exchange            $1.9       1 day         95%


        The 95% confidence interval signifies the Company's degree of
   confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses
   shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that
   interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the
   Company's favor. The value-at-risk model assumes that all movements in
   these rates will be adverse. Actual experience has shown that gains
   and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly
   unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over
   an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered
   projections of future losses, since actual results may differ
   significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets.

   EURO CURRENCY CONVERSION

        On January 1, 1999, the "Euro" became the common legal currency
   for 11 of the 15 member countries of the European Union. On that date,
   the participating countries fixed conversion rates between their
   existing sovereign currencies ("legacy currencies") and the Euro. On
   January 4, 1999, the Euro began trading on currency exchanges and
   became available for non-cash transactions, if the parties elected to
   use it. The legacy currencies will remain legal tender through
   December 31, 2001. Beginning January 1, 2002, participating countries
   will introduce Euro-denominated bills and coins, and effective July 1,
   2002, legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender.

        After the dual currency phase, all businesses in participating
   countries must conduct all transactions in the Euro and must convert
   their financial records and reports to be Euro-based. The Company has
   commenced an internal analysis of the Euro conversion process to
   prepare its information technology systems for the conversion and
   analyze related risks and issues, such as the benefit of the decreased
   exchange rate risk in cross-border transactions involving
   participating countries and the impact of increased price transparency
   on cross-border competition in these countries.

        The Company believes that the Euro conversion process will not
   have a material impact on the Company's businesses or financial
   condition on a consolidated basis.

             ----------------------------------------------------------

        The information required by this item is incorporated herein by
   reference to the section entitled "Market Risk" in the Company's
   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and

   ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
            --------------------------------

   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   To the Stockholders of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.:

        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
   Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of
   December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 and the related consolidated
   statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income
   and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
   December 31, 2000. We did not audit the financial statements of
   Rubbermaid Incorporated for the year and period ended December 31,
   1998. Rubbermaid was acquired on March 24, 1999 in a transaction
   accounted for as a pooling of interests, as discussed in note 1 to the
   consolidated financial statements. Such statements are included in the
   consolidated financial statements of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. and
   subsidiaries and reflect total assets and total revenues of 34 percent
   and 40 percent, respectively, in 1998 of the related consolidated
   totals. These statements were audited by other auditors whose report






   has been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the
   amounts included for Rubbermaid Incorporated, is based solely upon the
   report of the other auditors. These consolidated financial statements
   are the responsibility of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.'s management. Our
   responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
   financial statements based on our audits.

        We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
   generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that
   we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
   whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
   audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
   amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
   includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
   estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
   financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the
   report of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
   opinion.

        In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other
   auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
   in all material respects, the financial position of Newell Rubbermaid
   Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 and the
   results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
   years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with
   accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

        Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
   basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in
   Part IV Item 14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K is presented for the purposes
   of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
   is not a required part of the basic financial statements.  This
   schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our
   audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly
   states in all material respects the financial data required to be set
   forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
   whole.

   INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

   Shareholders and Board of Directors
   Rubbermaid Incorporated:

   We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Rubbermaid
   Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 1, 1999, and
   the related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity






   and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the year then ended (the
   consolidated financial statements are not included herein).  These
   consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
   Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
   these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

   We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
   accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards require
   that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
   about whether the financial statements are free of material
   misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
   supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
   An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
   significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
   overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit
   provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
   above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
   of Rubbermaid Incorporated and subsidiaries as of January 1, 1999, and
   the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then
   ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
   the United States of America.

   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999,

   1.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The consolidated financial
   statements include the accounts of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. and its
   majority owned subsidiaries (the "Company") after elimination of
   intercompany accounts and transactions.

        On March 24, 1999, Newell Co. ("Newell") completed a merger with
   Rubbermaid Incorporated ("Rubbermaid") in which Rubbermaid became a
   wholly owned subsidiary of Newell. Simultaneously with the
   consummation of the merger, Newell changed its name to Newell
   Rubbermaid Inc. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests
   and the financial statements have been restated to combine
   retroactively Rubbermaid's financial statements with those of Newell
   as if the merger had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period
   presented.

        USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of these financial statements
   required the use of certain estimates by management in determining the
   Company's assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related
   disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

        RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain 1999 and 1998 amounts have been
   reclassified to conform with the 2000 presentation.

        REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales of merchandise are recognized upon
   shipment to customers and when all substantial risks of ownership
   change.

        In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
   Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, which clarified the
   existing accounting rules for revenue recognition. SAB No. 101 (as
   modified by SAB No. 101 A and B) was adopted by the Company in the
   first quarter of 2000. The Company's revenue recognition policy did
   not change with the adoption of SAB No. 101.

        DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The
   following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
   of each class of financial instruments:

        LONG-TERM DEBT: The fair value of the Company's long-term debt
        issued under the medium-term note program is estimated based on
        quoted market prices which approximate cost. All other
        significant long-term debt is pursuant to floating rate
        instruments whose carrying amounts approximate fair value.

        COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED
        SECURITIES OF A SUBSIDIARY TRUST: The fair value of the $500.0
        million company-obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible







        preferred securities of a subsidiary trust was $328.1 million at
        December 31, 2000 based on quoted market prices.

        CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash and highly liquid short-term
   investments having a maturity of three months or less.

        ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS:  Allowances for doubtful
   accounts at December 31 totaled $36.1 million in 2000, $41.9 million
   in 1999 and $34.2 million in 1998.

        INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
   market value. Cost of certain domestic inventories (approximately 64%,
   72% and 72% of total inventories at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
   respectively) was determined by the "last-in, first-out" ("LIFO")
   method; for the balance, cost was determined using the "first-in,
   first-out" ("FIFO") method. If the FIFO inventory valuation method had
   been used exclusively, inventories would have increased by $15.9
   million, $11.4 million and $14.2 million at December 31, 2000, 1999
   and 1998, respectively. Inventory reserves (excluding LIFO reserves)
   at December 31 totaled $114.6 million in 2000, $119.4 million in 1999
   and $113.8 million in 1998.  The components of inventories, net of the
   LIFO reserve, were as follows:

                                       ========   ========   ========

        OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS: The Company has a 49% ownership
   interest in American Tool Companies, Inc., a manufacturer of hand
   tools and power tool accessory products marketed primarily under the
   Vise-Grip{R} and Irwin{R} trademarks. This investment is accounted for
   on the equity method with a net investment of $72.8 million at
   December 31, 2000.

        LONG-TERM MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES: Long-term marketable
   equity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair
   value with adjustments to fair value reported separately, net of tax,
   as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (and excluded
   from earnings). Gains and losses on the sales of long-term marketable
   equity securities are based upon the average cost of securities sold.
   On March 8, 1998, the Company sold 7,862,300 shares it held in The
   Black & Decker Corporation. The Black & Decker transaction resulted in
   net proceeds of approximately $378.3 million and a net pre-tax gain,
   after fees and expenses, of approximately $191.5 million. Long-term
   marketable equity securities are summarized as follows:

                                       =======    =======    =======

        Replacements and improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for
   maintenance and repairs are charged to expense. The components of
   depreciation are provided by annual charges to income calculated to
   amortize, principally on the straight-line basis, the cost of the
   depreciable assets over their depreciable lives. Estimated useful
   lives determined by the Company are: buildings and improvements (5-40
   years) and machinery and equipment (2-15 years).

        TRADE NAMES AND GOODWILL:  The cost of trade names and goodwill
   represents the excess of cost over identifiable net assets of
   businesses acquired. The Company does not allocate such excess cost to
   trade names separate from goodwill. In addition, the Company may
   allocate excess cost to other identifiable intangible assets and
   record such intangible assets in Other Assets (long-term). Trade names
   and goodwill are amortized over 40 years and other identifiable
   intangible assets are amortized over 5 to 40 years. Trade names and
   goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, respectively,
   consisted of the following:

    Recorded in Other Assets

        LONG-LIVED ASSETS: Subsequent to an acquisition, the Company
   periodically evaluates whether later events and circumstances have
   occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-
   lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of
   long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If factors indicate that
   long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the
   Company would use an estimate of the relevant business' undiscounted
   net cash flow over the remaining life of the long-lived assets in
   measuring whether the carrying value is recoverable. An impairment
   loss would be measured by reducing the carrying value to fair value,
   based on a discounted cash flow analysis.

        ACCRUED LIABILITIES: Accrued liabilities included the following:

   DECEMBER 31,                          2000       1999       1998
   ------------                          ----       ----       ----
   (In millions)

   Customer accruals                   $240.7     $296.6     $190.2
   Accrued self-insurance liability      99.9       92.0       80.2


        Customer accruals are promotional allowances and rebates given to
   customers in exchange for their selling efforts. The self-insurance
   accrual is primarily for workers' compensation and product liability
   and is estimated based upon historical claim experience.






        FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Foreign currency balance sheet
   accounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in
   effect at fiscal year end. Income and expenses are translated at the
   average rates of exchange in effect during the year. The related
   translation adjustments are made directly to accumulated other
   comprehensive income. International subsidiaries operating in highly
   inflationary economies translate non-monetary assets at historical
   rates, while net monetary assets are translated at current rates, with
   the resulting translation adjustment included in net income as other
   nonoperating (income) expenses. Foreign currency transaction gains and
   losses were immaterial in 2000, 1999 and 1998.

        ADVERTISING COSTS: The company expenses advertising costs as
   incurred, including cooperative advertising programs with customers.
   Total advertising expense was $289.2 million, $285.3 million and
   $281.5 million for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Cooperative
   advertising is recorded in the financial statements as a reduction of
   sales because it is viewed as part of the negotiated price of
   products. All other advertising costs are charged to selling, general
   and administrative expenses.

        RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS: Research and development costs
   relating to both future and present products are charged to selling,
   general and administrative expenses as incurred. These costs
   aggregated $49.4 million, $49.9 million and $44.5 million in 2000,
   1999 and 1998, respectively.

        EARNINGS PER SHARE: The earnings per share amounts are computed
   based on the weighted average monthly number of shares outstanding
   during the year. "Basic" earnings per share is calculated by dividing
   net income by weighted average shares outstanding. "Diluted" earnings
   per share is calculated by dividing net income by weighted average
   shares outstanding, including the assumption of the exercise and/or
   conversion of all potentially dilutive securities ("in the money"
   stock options and company-obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible
   preferred securities of a subsidiary trust).

        A reconciliation of the difference between basic and diluted
   earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
   1998, respectively, is shown below (in millions, except per share
   data):

   

       Diluted earnings per share for 1999 exclude the impact of "in the
        money" stock options and convertible preferred securities because
        they are antidilutive.

        COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Comprehensive income and accumulated other
   comprehensive income encompass net income, net after-tax unrealized
   gains on securities available for sale and foreign currency transla-
   tion adjustments in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders'
   Equity and Comprehensive Income.

        The following table displays the components of accumulated other
   comprehensive income:

        ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: Since June 1998, the Financial
   Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") has issued SFAS Nos. 133, 137 and
   138 related to "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
   Activities" ("SFAS No. 133, as amended" or "Statements"). These
   Statements establish accounting and reporting standards requiring that
   every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either
   an asset or liability measured at its fair value. The Statements
   require that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized
   currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are
   met, in which case the gains or losses would offset the related
   results of the hedged item. These Statements require that, as of the
   date of initial adoption, the impact of adoption be recorded as a
   cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. To the extent
   that these amounts are recorded in other comprehensive income, they
   will be reversed into earnings in the period in which the hedged
   transaction occurs. The impact of adopting these Statements on January
   1, 2001 resulted in a cumulative after-tax gain of approximately $13.0
   million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and had no
   material impact on net income. The adoption resulted in an increase in
   assets and liabilities of approximately $99.0 million and $86.0
   million, respectively.

        In May 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF"), a
   subcommittee of the FASB, issued EITF No. 00-10 "Accounting for
   Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs." EITF No. 00-10 requires that
   amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs be
   classified as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and
   handling be classified as a cost of products sold. Historically, these
   revenues and costs have been netted together and deducted from gross
   sales to arrive at net sales. The net sales and cost of products sold
   have been restated for this change. The impact of this change
   increased net sales and costs of products sold by $286.1 million,
   $298.7 million and $309.5 million for the years ended December 2000,
   1999 and 1998, respectively. There is no impact on gross income
   resulting from this change.

        Also in May 2000, the EITF issued EITF No. 00-14 "Accounting for
   Certain Sales Incentives." The EITF subsequently amended the
   transition provisions of this issue in November 2000. EITF No. 00-14
   prescribes guidance regarding timing of recognition and income
   statement classification of costs incurred for certain sales incentive
   programs. This guidance requires certain coupons, rebate offers and
   free products offered concurrently with a single exchange transaction
   to be recognized when incurred, and reported as a reduction of
   revenue.






        In January 2001, the EITF issued EITF No. 00-22 "Accounting for
   'Points' and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentive
   Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in
   the Future." EITF No. 00-22 prescribes guidance regarding timing of
   recognition and income statement classification of costs incurred in
   connection with offers of "free" products or services that are
   exercisable by an end consumer as a result of a single exchange
   transaction with the retailer which will not be delivered by the
   vendor until a future date. This guidance requires certain rebate
   offers and free products that are delivered subsequent to a single
   exchange transaction to be recognized when incurred, and reported as a
   reduction of revenue.

        The effective dates of EITF No. 00-14 and EITF No. 00-22 are
   March 31, 2001 and June 30, 2001, respectively. The Company's adoption
   of both EITF No. 00-14 and EITF No. 00-22 on December 31, 2000 did not
   impact the results of operations, because the Company's past and
   current accounting policy is to report such costs as reductions in
   revenue.


   2.   ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES

   ----

        The Company acquired Mersch SA on January 24, 2000 and Brio on
   May 24, 2000.  Both are manufacturers and suppliers of picture frames
   in Europe, and now operate as part of Newell Photo Fashion Europe.

        The Company acquired the stationery products business of The
   Gillette Company ("Paper Mate/Parker") on December 29, 2000. The U.S.
   and Canadian operations were merged into Sanford North America, while
   all other operations were consolidated into Sanford International.

        For these and for other minor acquisitions, the Company paid
   $582.7 million in cash and assumed $15.5 million of debt. The
   transactions were accounted for as purchases; therefore, results of
   operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
   statements since their respective acquisition dates. The acquisition
   costs were allocated on a preliminary basis to the fair market value
   of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted in trade
   names and goodwill of approximately $241.3 million.

        The Company's finalized integration plans may include exit costs
   for certain plants and product lines and employee terminations
   associated with the integration of Mersch and Brio into Newell Photo
   Fashion Europe and Paper Mate/Parker into Sanford North America and
   Sanford International. The final adjustments to the purchase price
   allocations are not expected to be material to the consolidated
   financial statements.







        The unaudited consolidated results of operations for the years
   ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 on a pro forma basis, as though the
   Mersch, Brio and Paper Mate/Parker businesses (as well as the 1999
   acquisitions of Ateliers, Reynolds, McKechnie and Ceanothe) had been
   acquired on January 1, 1999, are as follows (unaudited):

        For these and for other minor acquisitions, the Company paid
   $400.1 million in cash and assumed $45.1 million of debt. The
   transactions were accounted for as purchases; therefore, results of
   operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
   statements since their respective dates of acquisition. The
   acquisition costs were allocated on a preliminary basis to the fair
   market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and
   resulted in trade names and goodwill of approximately $296.7 million.

        The Company began to formulate integration plans for these
   acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates. The integration
   plans for these acquisitions were finalized during 2000 and resulted






   in total integration liabilities of $37.6 million for exit costs and
   employee terminations. As of December 31, 2000, $9.7 million of
   reserves remain for the restructuring charges recorded in 1999.

   writing and drawing instruments portion of Rotring operates as part of
   Sanford International. The art materials portion of Rotring operates
   as part of Sanford North America. The color cosmetic products portion
   of Rotring operates as a separate U.S. division, Cosmolab.

        For these and for other minor acquisitions, the Company paid
   $615.7 million in cash and assumed $99.5 million of debt. The
   transactions were accounted for as purchases; therefore, results of
   operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
   statements since their respective dates of acquisition. The
   acquisition costs were allocated on a preliminary basis to the fair
   market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and
   resulted in trade names and goodwill of approximately $387.1 million.

        The Company began to formulate integration plans for these and
   other minor acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates. The
   integration plans for these acquisitions were finalized during 1999
   and resulted in total integration liabilities of $84.7 million for
   exit costs and employee terminations. As of December 31, 2000, no
   reserves remain for the restructuring charges recorded in 1998.






   MERGERS

        On May 7, 1998, a subsidiary of the Company merged with Calphalon
   Corporation, a manufacturer and marketer of gourmet cookware. The
   Company issued approximately 3.1 million shares of Common Stock for
   all of the Common Stock of Calphalon. This transaction was accounted
   for as a pooling of interests; therefore, prior financial statements
   were restated to reflect this merger. Calphalon now operates as a
   separate division of the Company.

        On March 24, 1999, the Company completed the Rubbermaid merger.
   The merger qualified as a tax-free exchange and was accounted for as a
   pooling of interests. Newell issued .7883 Newell Rubbermaid shares for
   each outstanding share of Rubbermaid Common Stock. A total of 119.0
   million shares (adjusted for fractional and dissenting shares) of the
   Company's Common Stock were issued as a result of the merger, and
   Rubbermaid's outstanding stock options were converted into options to
   purchase approximately 2.5 million Newell Rubbermaid common shares.

        No adjustments were made to the net assets of the combining
   companies to adopt conforming accounting practices or fiscal years
   other than adjustments to eliminate the accounting effects related to
   Newell's purchase of Rubbermaid's office products business ("Eldon")
   in 1997. Because the Newell Rubbermaid merger was accounted for as a
   pooling of interests, the accounting effects of Newell's purchase of
   Eldon have been eliminated as if Newell had always owned it.

        The following table presents a reconciliation of net sales and
   net income (loss) for Newell, Rubbermaid and Calphalon individually to
   those presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements:

   DIVESTITURES

        On April 29, 1998, the Company sold its Decora decorative
   coverings product line. On August 21, 1998, the Company sold its
   Stuart Hall school supplies and stationery business. On September 9,
   1998, the Company sold its Newell Plastics plastic storage and
   serveware business. The pre-tax net gain on the sales of these
   businesses was $59.8 million, which was primarily offset by
   nondeductible goodwill, resulting in a net after-tax gain of $15.1
   million. Sales for these businesses prior to their divestitures were
   approximately $136 million in 1998.


   3.   RESTRUCTURING COSTS

   ----

        During 2000, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   of $48.6 million ($29.9 million after taxes) related primarily to the
   continued Rubbermaid integration and plant closures in the Home Decor
   segment. The Company incurred employee severance and termination
   benefit costs of $26.8 million related to approximately 700 employees
   terminated in 2000. Such costs included $10.2 million of severance and
   government mandated settlements for facility closures at Rubbermaid
   Europe, $6.7 million of change in control payments made to former
   Rubbermaid executives, $6.3 million for employee terminations at the
   domestic Rubbermaid divisions and $3.6 million in severance at the
   Home Decor segment. The Company incurred merger transaction costs of
   $11.2 million related primarily to legal settlements for Rubbermaid's
   1998 sale of a former division and other merger related contingencies
   resolved in 2000. Additionally, the Company incurred facility and
   product line exit costs of $10.6 million related primarily to the
   closure of five European Rubbermaid facilities, three window
   furnishings facilities and the exit of various Rubbermaid product
   lines.

        As of December 31, 2000, $21.9 million of reserves remain for
   restructuring charges recorded during 2000, 1999 and 1998. These
   reserves consist of $11.4 million for facility and product line exit
   costs, $4.6 million in contractual future maintenance costs on
   abandoned Rubbermaid computer software, $3.3 million for employee
   severance and termination benefits, and $2.6 million in other merger
   transaction costs.

   ----

        During 1999, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   of $246.4 million ($195.7 million after tax) related primarily to the
   integration of the Rubbermaid businesses into Newell. Merger
   transaction costs of $39.9 million related primarily to investment






   banking, legal and accounting costs for the Newell/Rubbermaid merger.
   Employee severance and termination benefits of $101.9 million related
   to approximately 750 employees terminated in 1999. Such costs include
   $80.9 million of change in control payments made to former Rubbermaid
   executives and $21.0 million in severance and termination costs at
   Rubbermaid's former headquarters ($5.5 million), Rubbermaid Home
   Products division ($6.9 million), Rubbermaid Europe division ($4.0
   million), Little Tikes division ($2.7 million), Rubbermaid Commercial
   Products division ($0.7 million) and Newell divisions ($1.2 million).
   Facility and product line exit costs totaled $104.6 million,
   representing $72.0 million of impaired Rubbermaid centralized computer
   software (abandoned as a result of converting Rubbermaid onto existing
   Newell centralized computer software) and $32.6 million in costs
   related to discontinued product lines ($4.8 million), the closure of
   seven Rubbermaid facilities ($10.2 million), write-off of assets
   associated with abandoned projects ($10.3 million) and impaired assets
   ($5.7 million) and other exit costs ($1.6 million).

   ----

        During January 1998, Rubbermaid announced a series of
   restructuring initiatives to establish a central global procurement
   organization and to consolidate, automate and/or relocate its
   worldwide manufacturing and distribution operations. During 1998,
   Rubbermaid recorded pre-tax charges of $115.2 million ($74.9 million
   after tax). The 1998 restructuring charge included $16.0 million
   relating to employee severance and termination benefits for
   approximately 600 sales and administrative employees, $53.4 million
   for costs to exit business activities at five facilities and $45.8
   million to write-down impaired long-lived assets to their fair value.
   The $53.4 million charge for costs to exit business activities related
   to exit plans for the closure of a plastics houseware molding and
   warehouse operation in the State of New York, the closure of a
   commercial play systems warehouse and manufacturing facility in
   Australia, the closure of a cleaning products manufacturing operation
   in North Carolina, the elimination of Rubbermaid's Asia Pacific
   regional headquarters and the related joint venture in Japan and the
   closure of a distribution facility in France. The exiting of the
   operations described above necessitated a revaluation of cash flows
   related to those operations, resulting in a $45.8 million charge to
   write-down $26.0 million of fixed assets and $19.8 million of goodwill
   to fair value. Rubbermaid determined that the future cash flows on an
   undiscounted basis (before taxes and interest) were not sufficient to
   cover the carrying value of the long-lived assets affected by those
   decisions. Management determined the fair value of these assets using
   discounted cash flows.











   4.   CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

        The Company has short-term foreign and domestic committed and
   uncommitted lines of credit with various banks which are available for
   short-term financing. Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines
   of credit are subject to the discretion of the lender. The Company's
   lines of credit do not have a material impact on the Company's
   liquidity. Borrowings under these lines of credit at December 31, 2000
   totaled $23.5 million. The following is a summary of borrowings under
   foreign and domestic lines of credit:

                                     ========     ========    ========


        The Company has a revolving credit agreement of $1,300.0 million
   that will terminate in August 2002. During 2000, the Company entered
   into a new 364-day revolving credit agreement in the amount of $700.0
   million. This revolving credit agreement will terminate in October
   2001. At December 31, 2000, there were no borrowings under these
   revolving credit agreements.

        In lieu of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit
   agreements, the Company may issue up to $2,000.0 million of commercial
   paper. The Company's revolving credit agreements provide the committed
   backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly,
   commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for
   borrowing under the Company's revolving credit agreements. At December
   31, 2000, $1,503.7 million (principal amount) of commercial paper was
   outstanding. Of this amount, $1,300.0 million is classified as long-
   term debt and the remainder of $203.7 million is classified as current
   portion of long-term debt.

        The revolving credit agreements permit the Company to borrow
   funds on a variety of interest rate terms. These agreements require,
   among other things, that the Company maintain a certain Total
   Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreements. As
   of December 31, 2000, the Company was in compliance with these
   agreements.

        The Company had outstanding at December 31, 2000 a total of
   $1,012.5 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes. The
   maturities on the Company's medium-term notes range from 3 to 30 years
   at an average interest rate of 6.34%.

        A universal shelf registration statement became effective in July
   1999. As of December 31, 2000, $449.5 million of Company debt and
   equity securities may be issued under the shelf.








        The aggregate maturities of long-term debt outstanding are as
   follows:

   6.   COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED
        SECURITIES OF A SUBSIDIARY TRUST

        In 1997, a wholly owned trust of the Company issued 10.0 million
   of 5.25% convertible quarterly income preferred securities ("Preferred
   Securities") to certain institutional buyers. Each of the Preferred
   Securities represents an undivided beneficial interest in the assets
   of the trust, is convertible at the option of the holder into shares
   of the Company's Common Stock at the rate of 0.9865 shares of Common
   Stock (equivalent to the approximate conversion price of $50.685 per
   share of Common Stock), subject to adjustment in certain
   circumstances, has a $50 liquidation preference and is entitled to a
   quarterly cash distribution at the annual rate of $2.625 per share.
   The Preferred Securities are guaranteed by the Company and are
   callable initially at 103.15% of the liquidation preference beginning
   in December 2001 and decreasing over time to 100% in December 2007.

        The trust invested the proceeds of the Preferred Securities in
   $500.0 million Company 5.25% Junior Convertible Subordinated
   Debentures due 2027 ("Debentures"). The Debentures are the sole assets
   of the trust, mature on December 1, 2027, bear interest at the annual
   rate of 5.25%, payable quarterly, and are redeemable by the Company
   beginning in December 2001. The Company may defer interest payments on
   the Debentures, but has no current intention to, for a period of up to
   20 consecutive quarters during which distribution payments on the
   Preferred Securities are also deferred. Under this circumstance, the
   Company may not declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to
   its capital stock or debt securities that do not rank senior to the
   Debentures.











   7.   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

        The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
   financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. They
   are used to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency risks.

        The Company has entered into several interest rate swap
   agreements as a means of converting certain floating rate debt
   instruments into fixed rate debt. Cash flows related to these interest
   rate swap agreements are included in interest expense over the terms
   of the agreements, which range from three to seven years in maturity.
   At December 31, 2000, the Company had an outstanding notional
   principal amount of $912.6 million, with a net accrued interest
   receivable of $3.4 million. The termination value of these contracts
   is not included in the consolidated financial statements since these
   contracts represent the hedging of long-term activities to be
   amortized in future reporting periods.

        The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts to manage foreign
   exchange risk related to both known and anticipated intercompany and
   third-party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or
   less.

        The Company also utilizes cross-currency swaps to hedge long-term
   intercompany transactions. The maturities on these cross-currency
   swaps range from three to five years.

        The following table summarizes the Company's forward exchange
   contracts, foreign currency swaps and long-term cross-currency swaps
   in U.S. dollars by major currency and contractual amount. The "buy"
   amounts represent the U.S. equivalent of commitments to purchase
   foreign currencies, and the "sell" amounts represent the U.S.
   equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies according to
   local needs in foreign subsidiaries. The contractual amounts of
   significant forward exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and
   long-term cross-currency swaps and their fair value were as follows:

        The Company's forward exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps
   and long-term cross-currency swaps do not subject the Company to risk
   due to foreign exchange rate movement, since gains and losses on these
   contracts generally offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities
   and other transactions being hedged. The Company does not obtain
   collateral or other security to support derivative financial
   instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of
   the counterparties.

        Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and
   intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of
   the underlying transactions. Derivatives used to hedge intercompany
   loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses
   included in the consolidated statements of income.


   8.   LEASES

        The Company leases manufacturing and warehouse facilities, real
   estate, transportation, data processing and other equipment under
   leases which expire at various dates through the year 2018. Rent
   expense was $102.9 million, $91.9 million and $79.7 million in 2000,
   1999 and 1998, respectively. Future minimum rental payments for
   operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year
   are as follows:

   9.   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS

        The Company and its subsidiaries have noncontributory pension and
   profit sharing plans covering substantially all of their foreign and
   domestic employees. Pension plan benefits are generally based on years
   of service and/or compensation. The Company's funding policy is to
   contribute not less than the minimum amounts required by the Employee
   Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or local statutes to assure
   that plan assets will be adequate to provide retirement benefits. The
   Company's Common Stock comprised $46.7 million, $48.7 million and
   $69.3 million of pension plan assets at December 31, 2000, 1999 and
   1998, respectively.

        Total expense under all profit sharing plans was $14.5 million,
   $12.3 million and $25.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2000,
   1999 and 1998, respectively.
   ^G63

        In addition to the Company's pension and profit sharing plans,
   several of the Company's subsidiaries currently provide retiree health
   care benefits for certain employee groups.

        The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations,
   plan assets and funded status of the plans within the guidelines of
   SFAS No. 132:

















     

        Net pension (income) expenses and other postretirement benefit
   expenses include the following components:

   

              The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
   and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated
   benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:










    DECEMBER 31,                              2000      1999      1998
    ------------                              ----      ----      ----
    (In millions)
    Projected benefit obligation             $103.7    $145.2    $147.1
    Accumulated benefit obligation             85.3     131.0     127.5
    Fair value of plan assets                   -        50.8      52.1

   The health care cost trend rate significantly affects the reported
   postretirement benefit costs and obligations. A one percentage point
   change in the assumed rate would have the following effects:

                                         1% Increase      1% Decrease
                                         -----------      -----------

    Effect on total of service and
      interest cost components               $1.8            $(1.6)
    Effect on postretirement benefit
      obligations                            11.9            (11.0)


   10.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

        At December 31, 2000, the Company's Common Stock consists of
   800.0 million authorized shares with a par value of $1 per share.

        On February 7, 2000, the Company announced a stock repurchase
   program of up to $500.0 million of the Company's outstanding Common
   Stock. During 2000, the Company repurchased 15.5 million shares of its
   Common Stock at an average price of $26 per share, for a total cash
   price of $403.0 million under the program. The repurchase program
   remained in effect until December 31, 2000 and was financed through
   the use of working capital and commercial paper.

        Each share of Common Stock includes a stock purchase right (a
   "Right"). Each Right will entitle the holder, until the earlier of
   October 31, 2008 or the redemption of the Rights, to buy the number of
   shares of Common Stock having a market value of two times the exercise
   price of $200, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The
   Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or
   more of voting power of the Company or announces a tender offer after
   which it would hold 15% or more of the Company's voting power. The
   Rights held by the 15% stockholder would not be exercisable in this
   situation.

        Furthermore, if, following the acquisition by a person or group
   of 15% or more of the Company's voting stock, the Company was acquired
   in a merger or other business combination or 50% or more of its assets
   were sold, each Right (other than Rights held by the 15% stockholder)
   would become exercisable for that number of shares of Common Stock of
   the Company (or the surviving company in a business combination)
   having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.







        The Company may redeem the Rights at $0.001 per Right prior to
   the occurrence of an event that causes the Rights to become
   exercisable for Common Stock.

   11.  STOCK OPTIONS

        The Company's stock option plans are accounted for under
   Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. As a result, the Company
   grants fixed stock options under which no compensation cost is
   recognized. Had compensation cost for the plans been determined
   consistent with FASB Statement No. 123, the Company's net income and
   earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma
   amounts:

    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,                  2000       1999      1998
    -----------------------                  ----       ----      ----
    (In millions, except per share data)

    Net income:
        As reported                          $421.6     $95.4    $481.8
        Pro forma                             410.5      88.2     477.5
    Diluted earnings per share:
        As reported                            $1.57     $0.34     $1.70

        Pro forma                               1.53      0.31      1.69

        Because the FASB Statement No. 123 method of accounting has not
   been applied to options granted prior to January 1, 1995, the
   resulting pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of
   that to be expected in future years.

        The Company has authorized 16.3 million shares of Common Stock to
   be issued under various stock option plans. Under the Company's
   primary plan (1993 Stock Option Plan) the Company may grant options
   for up to 14.1 million shares, of which the Company has granted 7.7
   million options, and canceled 1.1 million options through December 31,
   2000. Under this plan, the option exercise price equals the Common
   Stock's closing price on the date of the grant, and options vest over
   a five-year period and expire after ten years.

        The following summarizes the changes in the number of shares of
   Common Stock under option, including options to acquire Common Stock
   resulting from the conversion of options under pre-merger Rubbermaid
   option plans:

        The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
   grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
   assumptions used for grants in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively:
   risk-free interest rate of 6.5%, 6.6% and 4.1-6.4%; expected dividend
   yields of 3.0%, 2.0%, and 1.6-2.0%; expected lives of 9.0, 9.0 and
   5.0-9.9 years; and expected volatility of 28%, 25% and 20-34%.

   15.  LITIGATION

        The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims,
   including the environmental matters described below, that have arisen
   in the ordinary conduct of its business or have been assumed by the
   Company when it purchased certain businesses. Although management of
   the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters with
   certainty, it believes that their ultimate resolution, including any
   amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts reserved, will
   not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
   statements.

        As of December 31, 2000, the Company was involved in various
   matters concerning federal and state environmental laws and
   regulations, including matters in which the Company has been
   identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain
   state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party
   ("PRP") at contaminated sites under the Federal Comprehensive
   Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and
   equivalent state laws.

        In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has
   considered several factors, including: the extent of the Company's
   volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other PRPs;
   the kind of waste; the terms of existing cost sharing and other
   applicable agreements; the financial ability of other PRPs to share in
   the payment of requisite costs; the Company's prior experience with
   similar sites; environmental studies and cost estimates available to
   the Company; the effects of inflation on cost estimates; and the
   extent to which the Company's and other parties' status as PRPs is
   disputed.






        Based on information available to it, the Company's estimate of
   environmental response costs associated with these matters as of
   December 31, 2000 ranged between $15.7 million and $21.6 million. As
   of December 31, 2000, the Company had a reserve equal to $20.0 million
   for such environmental response costs in the aggregate. No insurance
   recovery was taken into account in determining the Company's cost
   estimates or reserve, nor do the Company's cost estimates or reserve
   reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with
   respect to two long term (30 years) operation and maintenance CERCLA
   matters which are estimated at present value.

        Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental
   investigations and response activities, the possibility that the
   Company could be identified as a PRP at sites identified in the future
   that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the
   possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses acquired,
   actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from the Company's
   estimates.

        Subject to difficulties in estimating future environmental
   response costs, the Company does not expect that any amount it may be
   required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of
   amounts reserved will have a material adverse effect on its
   consolidated financial statements.

        Eight complaints were filed against the Company and certain of
   its officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
   District of Illinois on behalf of a purported class consisting of
   persons who purchased Common Stock of the Company, Newell Co. or
   Rubbermaid Incorporated during the period from October 21, 1998
   through September 3, 1999 or exchanged shares of Rubbermaid Common
   Stock for the Company's Common Stock as part of the Newell Rubbermaid
   merger. The complaints alleged that during this time period the
   defendants violated federal securities laws by issuing false and
   misleading statements concerning the Company's financial condition and
   results of operations. After the cases were consolidated before a
   single judge, the court appointed lead plaintiffs for the uncertified
   class. Plaintiffs then filed a consolidated amended class action
   complaint consisting of six counts asserting claims under Sections 11,
   12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
   the Securities Exchange Act. All defendants moved to dismiss that
   amended complaint. On October 2, 2000, the court dismissed the amended
   complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be
   granted and on November 14, 2000 rejected the plaintiffs' motion for
   reconsideration of the prior dismissal. The court dismissed the
   action, and the time for filing an appeal expired with no appeal
   having been filed. The case is therefore terminated in favor of the
   Company and the other defendants.
