   GENERAL
   -------

   The Company is a global manufacturer and full-service marketer of
   name-brand consumer products serving the needs of volume purchasers,
   including department/specialty stores and warehouse clubs, home
   centers and hardware stores, and office superstores and contract
   stationers.  The Company's basic business strategy is to merchandise a
   multi-product offering of everyday consumer products, backed by an
   obsession with customer service excellence and new product
   development, in order to achieve maximum results for its stockholders.
   The Company's multi-product offering consists of name-brand consumer
   products in four business segments: Rubbermaid; Sharpie; Irwin and
   Calphalon Home.  The Company's financial objectives are to achieve
   above-average sales and earnings per share growth, maintain a superior
   return on investment and maintain a conservative level of debt.  To
   accomplish these objectives, the Company established five key measures
   to measure financial performance: internal sales growth, operating
   income as a percent of sales, working capital as a percent of sales,
   free cash flow and return on invested capital.  The Company defines
   free cash flow as cash provided from operating activities less capital
   expenditures and dividends.

   In an effort to achieve superior performance in the five key financial
   measures, the Company introduced six transformational strategic
   initiatives in 2001 as follows: Productivity, Streamlining, New
   Product Development, Marketing, Strategic Account Management, and
   Collaboration.





   Productivity is the initiative to reduce the cost of manufacturing a
   product by at least five percent per year, every year in order to
   become the best cost supplier.  Streamlining is the commitment to
   reduce non-value added costs and cut out excess layers.  New Product
   Development represents the commitment to develop and introduce
   cutting-edge, innovative new products to the market and develop best-
   cost products to meet end-user needs.  The Marketing initiative
   represents the Company's commitment to transform from a "push" to
   "pull" marketing organization, focusing on the end-user.  The
   Strategic Account Management initiative represents the Company's
   program to allocate resources to those strategic retailers the Company
   believes will continue to grow in the future.  Collaboration is the
   Company's initiative for the divisional operating units to work
   together and maximize economies of scale and the use of best
   practices.

   consolidated net sales.









   Certain 2001 and 2000 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
   2002 presentation.

   GROWTH STRATEGY
   ---------------

   The Company's growth strategy emphasizes internal growth and
   acquisitions.

   Internal Growth
   ---------------

   The Company has grown internally principally by introducing new
   products, entering new domestic and international markets, adding new
   customers, cross-selling existing product lines to current customers
   and supporting its U.S.-based customers' international expansion.
   Internal growth is defined by the Company as growth from its "core
   businesses," which include continuing businesses owned more than one
   year and minor acquisitions.  The Company's goal is to achieve above-
   average internal growth.

   Acquisition Strategy
   --------------------

   The Company supplements internal growth by acquiring businesses with
   prominent consumer-focused, retail brands and improving the
   profitability of such businesses through the implementation of the
   Company's Strategic Initiatives.  Other strategic criteria for an
   acquisition include the Company's ability to grow the business, its
   importance to key customers, its relationship to existing product
   lines, its function as a low-cost source of supply, its ability to
   provide the Company with an entrance into a new market, and the extent
   to which the Company can utilize the Phoenix Program in operating the
   business.  In addition, the Company will consider the business' actual
   and potential impact on the Key Financial Measures, as well as the
   operating performance of the Company's Group at issue.  While the
   Company evaluates alternatives continuously, its priority will be to
   reduce debt rather than invest in significant acquisitions over the
   next 12-18 months.  See Item 6 and Footnote 2 to the Consolidated
   Financial Statements for a description of recent transactions.



   Selective Globalization
   -----------------------

   The Company is pursuing selective international opportunities to
   further its internal growth and acquisition objectives.  The rapid
   growth of consumer goods economies and retail structures in several
   regions outside the U.S., particularly Europe, Mexico and South
   America, makes them attractive to the Company by providing selective
   opportunities to acquire businesses, develop partnerships with new
   foreign customers and extend relationships with the Company's domestic
   customers whose businesses are growing internationally.  The Company's
   recent acquisitions, combined with existing sales to foreign
   customers, increased its sales outside the U.S. to approximately 27%
   of total sales in 2002 and 2001 from 25% in 2000.

   Additional information regarding acquisitions of businesses is
   included in Item 6 and Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial
   Statements.

   Key Financial Measures
   ----------------------

   The Company established five key measures to evaluate financial
   performance:  internal sales growth, operating income as a percent of
   sales, working capital as a percent to sales, free cash flow, and
   return on invested capital.

   STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
   ---------------------

   Productivity
   ------------

   The Company's objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing a
   product by at least five percent per year on an ongoing basis in order
   to become the best-cost supplier to our customers.  To achieve
   productivity, the Company focuses on reducing purchasing costs,
   materials handling costs, manufacturing inefficiencies, and excess
   overhead costs to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing products.

   Streamlining
   ------------

   The streamlining initiative represents the Company's commitment and
   focus on reducing non-value added activities and excess layers within
   the organization.  The Company's goal is to use the savings generated
   from streamlining to fund marketing and other key initiatives, without
   increasing total expenses.  The Company is vigilant in creating a
   leaner organization that is more flexible in its response time, both
   internally and externally.





   New Product Development
   -----------------------

   The Company is determined to become the leader in introducing cutting-
   edge, innovative, and patented new products to the marketplace.  The
   Company seeks to employ the best and brightest new product engineers
   in order to achieve this goal through the implementation and execution
   of a world-class product development process.  The Company's intention
   is to become a "new product machine" that will enhance the brand image
   and help secure additional store listings.

   Marketing
   ---------

   The Company's objective is to develop long-term, mutually beneficial
   partnerships with its customers and become their supplier of choice.
   To achieve this goal, the Company has a value-added marketing program
   that offers a family of leading brand name staple products, tailored
   sales programs, innovative merchandising support, in-store services
   and responsive top management.

   The Company's marketing skills help customers stimulate store traffic
   and sales through timely advertising and innovative promotions.  The
   Company also assists customers in differentiating their offerings by
   customizing products and packaging.  Through self-selling packaging
   and displays that emphasize good-better-best value relationships,
   retail customers are encouraged to trade up to higher-value, best
   quality products.

   The Company is also committed to selective media advertising,
   including national television advertising where appropriate, in order
   to increase brand awareness among end-users of the product.

   Customer service also involves customer contact with top-level
   decision makers at the Company's divisions.  As part of its
   decentralized structure, the Company's division presidents are the
   chief marketing officers of their product lines and communicate
   directly with customers.  This structure permits early recognition of
   market trends and timely response to customer problems.

   Phoenix Program

   The marketing effort focuses largely on an extensive grass roots
   marketing campaign, highlighted by our Phoenix Program, which was
   introduced in 2001.  This initiative is an action-oriented field sales
   force consisting of approximately 500 recent university graduates.
   The team works in the field, primarily within our Strategic Account
   structure, performing in-store product demonstrations, event
   marketing, on-shelf merchandising, interacting with the end-user, and
   maintaining an ongoing relationship with store personnel.  This
   initiative allows the Company to enhance product placement and



   minimize stock outages and, together with the Strategic Account
   Management Program, to maximize shelf space potential.  This program
   continues to gain traction throughout several accounts and is expected
   to translate to the Consolidated Financial Statements through the
   impact of shelf space gains going forward.

   Strategic Account Management
   ----------------------------

   In 2001, the Company introduced the Strategic Account Management
   Program.  The Strategic Account Management Program is the Company's
   sales and marketing approach that focuses growth efforts on strategic
   accounts with high long-term growth potential.  Separate sales
   organizations have been established to more effectively manage the
   relationship at the largest strategic accounts, specifically Wal*Mart,
   The Home Depot and Lowe's.  As part of this program, the Company
   established President level positions to more effectively manage the
   relationships with these accounts.  The program allows the Company to
   present these customers with "one face" to enhance the Company's
   response time, understand the customer's needs and support the best
   possible customer relationship.

   Collaboration
   -------------

   Collaboration represents the Company's focus to benefit from the
   sharing of best practices and the reduction of costs achieved through
   economies of scale.  For example, functions, such as purchasing and
   distribution and transportation, have been centralized to increase
   buying power across the Company.

   Additionally, certain administrative functions are centralized at the
   corporate level including cash management, accounting systems, capital
   expenditure approvals, order processing, billing, credit, accounts
   receivable, data processing operations and legal functions.
   Centralization concentrates technical expertise in one location,
   making it easier to observe overall business trends and manage the
   Company's businesses.


   OTHER INFORMATION
   -----------------

   Multi-Product Offering
   ----------------------

   The Company's increasingly broad product coverage in multiple product
   lines permits it to more effectively meet the needs of its customers.
   With families of leading, brand name products and profitable new
   products, the Company also can help volume purchasers sell a more
   profitable product mix.  As a potential single source for an entire
   product line, the Company can use program merchandising to improve



   product presentation, optimize display space for both sales and income
   and encourage impulse buying by retail customers.

   Customer Service
   ----------------

   The Company believes that one of the primary ways it distinguishes
   itself from its competitors is through customer service. The Company's
   ability to provide superior customer service is a result of its
   information technology, marketing and merchandising programs designed
   to enhance the sales and profitability of its customers and consistent
   on-time delivery of its products.

   On-Time Delivery
   ----------------

   A critical element of the Company's customer service is consistent
   on-time delivery of products to its customers.  Retailers are pursuing
   a number of strategies to deliver the highest-quality, best-cost
   products to their customers.  A growing trend among retailers is to
   purchase on a "just-in-time" basis in order to reduce inventory costs
   and increase returns on investment.  As retailers shorten their lead
   times for orders, manufacturers need to more closely anticipate
   consumer-buying patterns.  The Company supports its retail customers'
   "just-in-time" inventory strategies through investments in improved
   forecasting systems, more responsive manufacturing and distribution
   capabilities and electronic communications.  The Company manufactures
   the vast majority of its products and has extensive experience in
   high-volume, cost-effective manufacturing.  The high-volume nature of
   its manufacturing processes and the relatively consistent demand for
   its products enables the Company to ship most products directly from
   its factories without the need for independent warehousing and
   distribution centers.

   Foreign Operations
   ------------------

   Information regarding the Company's 2002, 2001 and 2000 foreign
   operations is included in Footnote 14 to the Consolidated Financial
   Statements and is incorporated by reference herein.

   Raw Materials
   -------------

   The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for
   substantially all of its material requirements.  The raw materials and
   various purchased components required for its products have generally
   been available in sufficient quantities.







   Backlog
   -------

   The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.

   Seasonal Variations
   -------------------

   The Company's product groups are only moderately affected by seasonal
   trends.  The Rubbermaid and Calphalon Home business segments typically
   have higher sales in the second half of the year due to retail
   stocking related to the holiday season; the Irwin business segment has
   higher sales in the second and third quarters due to an increased
   level of do-it-yourself projects completed in the summer months; and
   the Sharpie business segment has higher sales in the second and third
   quarters due to the back-to-school season.  Because these seasonal
   trends are moderate, the Company's consolidated quarterly sales do not
   fluctuate significantly, unless a significant acquisition is made.

   Patents and Trademarks
   ----------------------

   The Company has many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names
   that are, in the aggregate, increasingly important to its business.
   The Company believes that no individual patent, trademark, brand name
   or trade name, other than the United States registered "Rubbermaid"
   trademark, is material to its consolidated operations.

   Competition
   -----------

   The Company competes with numerous other manufacturers and
   distributors of consumer products, many of which are large and
   well-established.  The Company's principal customers are large mass
   merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs
   and office superstores.  The rapid growth of these large mass
   merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns,
   have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer
   products retail industry and the formation of dominant multi-category
   retailers, many of which have strong bargaining power with suppliers.
   This environment significantly limits the Company's ability to recover
   cost increases through selling prices.  Other trends among retailers
   are to foster high levels of competition among suppliers, to demand
   that manufacturers supply innovative new products and to require
   suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products
   with shorter lead times.  Another trend, in the absence of a strong
   new product development effort or strong end-user brands, is for the
   retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources.
   The combination of these market influences has created an intensely
   competitive environment in which the Company's principal customers
   continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in
   pricing pressures and the need for strong end-user brands, the ongoing



   introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in
   customer service.

   For more than 30 years, the Company has positioned itself to respond
   to the challenges of this retail environment by developing strong
   relationships with large, high-volume purchasers.  The Company markets
   its strong multi-product offering through virtually every category of
   high-volume retailer, including discount, drug, grocery and variety
   chains, warehouse clubs, department, hardware and specialty stores,
   home centers, office superstores, contract stationers and military
   exchanges.  The Company's largest customer, Wal*Mart (which includes
   Sam's Club), accounted for approximately 15% of net sales in 2002.
   Other top ten customers included (IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER): JC Penney,
   Kmart, Lowe's, Staples, Target, The Home Depot, The Office Depot, Toys
   'R Us and United Stationers.

   The Company's other principal methods of meeting its competitive
   challenges are high brand name recognition, superior customer service
   (including industry leading information technology, innovative
   "good-better-best" marketing and merchandising programs), consistent
   on-time delivery, decentralized manufacturing and marketing,
   centralized administration, and experienced management.

   Employees
   ---------

   As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 47,000
   employees worldwide, of whom approximately 9,000 are covered by
   collective bargaining agreements or, in certain countries, other
   collective arrangements decreed by statute.

















   ITEM 2.   REAL PROPERTIES

   administrative offices and warehouses used for distribution of our
   products.  The Company also maintains sales offices throughout the
   United States and the world.  The corporate offices are located in
   Illinois in owned facilities at Freeport (approximately 91,000 square
   feet) and in owned and leased space in Rockford (approximately 8,700
   square feet).  Most of the idle facilities, which are excluded from
   the following list, are subleased while being held pending sale or

   ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF
   -------   OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
             --------------------------------------------------

   The following discussion and analysis provides information which
   management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of
   the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial
   condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the
   Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto.

   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   The following table sets forth for the periods indicated items from
   the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a percentage of net sales
   for the years ended December 31,:



   2002 VERSUS 2001

   Net sales for 2002 were $7,453.9 million, representing an increase of
   $544.6 million, or 7.9%, from $6,909.3 million in 2001. The increase
   primarily resulted from internal sales growth of 3.3% and sales
   contribution from American Tool Companies, Inc. of $318.3 million
   (acquired April 2002).




   Gross income as a percentage of net sales in 2002 was 27.6%, or
   $2,059.7 million, versus 27.0%, or $1,862.7 million, in 2001. Gross
   income includes restructuring related and other charges relating to
   integration costs of recent acquisitions of $13.8 million ($9.2
   million after taxes) and $7.4 million ($4.7 million after taxes) in
   2002 and 2001, respectively.  The improvement in gross income is
   primarily related to the implementation of a productivity initiative
   throughout the Company and higher margins from our new products.  The
   Company's productivity objective is to reduce the cost of
   manufacturing a product by at least five percent per year on an
   ongoing basis in order to become the best-cost supplier to our
   customers.  To achieve productivity improvements, the Company is
   focusing on reducing purchasing costs, materials handling costs,
   manufacturing inefficiencies, and excess overhead costs to reduce the
   overall cost of manufacturing products.

   Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in 2002 were
   17.5% of net sales, or $1,307.3 million, versus 16.9%, or $1,168.2
   million, in 2001.  SG&A includes charges relating to integration costs
   of recent acquisitions of $7.4 million ($4.9 million after taxes) and
   $12.0 million ($7.7 million after taxes) in 2002 and 2001,
   respectively.  The increase in SG&A is a result of the American Tool
   Companies, Inc. acquisition ($75.5 million) and planned investments in
   marketing initiatives, including the Company's Strategic Account
   Management Program, television advertising program and Phoenix
   Program, supporting the Company's brand portfolio and strategic
   account management strategy.

   The Company continues to invest in several programs launched in 2001.
   The Strategic Account Management Program is the Company's sales and
   marketing approach that focuses growth efforts on strategic accounts
   with high long-term growth potential.  Separate sales organizations
   have been established to more effectively manage the relationship at
   the largest strategic accounts, specifically Wal*Mart, The Home Depot
   and Lowe's.  As part of this program, the Company established
   President level positions to more effectively manage the relationships
   with these accounts.  The program allows the Company to present these
   customers with "one face" to enhance the Company's response time,
   understand the customer's needs and support the best possible customer
   relationship.

   In addition to the Strategic Account Management Program, the Company
   also continues to invest in its Phoenix Program.  This initiative is
   an action-oriented field sales force consisting of approximately 500
   recent university graduates.  The team works in the field, primarily
   within our Strategic Account structure, performing in-store product
   demonstrations, event marketing, on-shelf merchandising, interacting
   with the end-user, and maintaining an ongoing relationship with store
   personnel.  This initiative allows the Company to enhance product
   placement and minimize stock outages and, together with the Strategic
   Account Management Program, to maximize shelf space potential.  This
   program continues to gain traction throughout several accounts and is



   expected to translate to the Consolidated Financial Statements through
   the impact of shelf space gains going forward.

   During 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of
   $122.7 million associated with the Company's strategic restructuring
   plan.  The restructuring plan is intended to streamline the Company's
   supply chain to ensure its position as the best-cost global provider
   throughout the Company's product portfolio.  The plan consists of
   reducing worldwide headcount over the three years beginning in 2001,
   and includes consolidating duplicate manufacturing facilities.  As
   part of this plan, the Company incurred employee severance and
   termination benefit costs for approximately 3,100 employees.
   Additionally, the Company incurred facility exit costs related
   primarily to the closure of 43 facilities (seven at Rubbermaid, eight
   at Sharpie, fourteen at Irwin, twelve at Calphalon Home and two
   corporate administrative offices).  See Footnote 3 to the
   Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of these charges.

   Operating income in 2002 was 8.5% of net sales, or $629.7 million,
   versus 8.3% of net sales, or $570.9 million, in 2001. Operating income
   includes restructuring and other charges of $143.9 million ($95.8
   million after taxes) and $86.1 million ($54.8 million after taxes) in
   2002 and 2001, respectively.  The increase in operating margins was
   primarily due to improvement in gross margin and the elimination of
   amortization expense associated with goodwill (see Footnote 1 to the
   Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion) offset by
   planned investment in marketing initiatives supporting the Company's
   brand portfolio and strategic account management strategy and
   restructuring charges to streamline the Company's supply chain.

   Net nonoperating expenses in 2002 were 2.2% of net sales, or $161.2
   million, versus 2.3%, or $155.0 million, in 2001. Net nonoperating
   expense includes charges relating to integration costs of recent
   acquisitions and costs related to the Anchor Hocking withdrawn
   divestiture of $23.7 million ($15.9 million after tax) in 2002.  These
   costs were partially offset by lower interest rates.  See Footnotes
   2 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
   details.

   The effective tax rate was 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002
   versus 36.4% in the prior year.  See Footnote 12 to the Consolidated
   Financial Statements for an explanation of the effective tax rate.

   Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change in 2002 was
   $311.5 million, a $46.9 million, or 17.7% increase from $264.6 million
   in 2001. Diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of
   accounting change was $1.16 in 2002 compared to $0.99 in 2001.

   During the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the required
   impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets,
   which resulted in an impairment charge of $514.9 million, net of tax.
   See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further



   information on the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial
   Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and other Intangible
   Assets."

   Net loss for 2002 was $203.4 million compared to net income of $264.6
   million in 2001. Basic and diluted loss/earnings per share in 2002
   decreased to a loss of $0.76 versus income of $0.99 in 2001. The
   decrease in net income and earnings per share in 2002 was primarily
   due to the cumulative effect of accounting changes related to
   goodwill, and increased restructuring charges to streamline the
   Company's supply chain, partially offset by an improvement in gross
   margins, the elimination of amortization expense associated with
   goodwill, lower interest rates and a reduction in income tax expense.
   See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
   details related to cumulative effect of accounting change charge for
   goodwill.

   RUBBERMAID

   Net sales for 2002 were $2,592.4 million, an increase of $26.8
   million, or 1.0%, from $2,565.6 million in 2001.  The 1.0% sales
   growth was primarily due to 5.6% sales growth at the Rubbermaid Home
   Products division, partially offset by an 11.5% sales decline at
   Graco.  The decline at Graco was primarily due to an increase in
   competitive pressures.  The primary reasons for the overall sales
   increase were sales gains at strategic accounts and new product
   introductions, such as the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs{R}, the Slim
   Cooler{TM}, Stain Shield{TM}, and the Tool Tower{TM} and growth in
   existing products, partially offset by product price reductions.

   Operating income for 2002 was $214.5 million, an increase of $13.6
   million, or 6.8%, from $200.9 million in 2001.  The increase is
   primarily related to productivity improvements and increased margin
   for new products, partially offset by product price reductions and
   continued investments in divisional growth initiatives, including
   costs related to new product development and product launches,
   primarily television advertising for featured items such as the Slim
   Cooler{TM} and the Tool Tower{TM}.

   SHARPIE

   Net sales for 2002 were $1,908.7 million, an increase of $109.3
   million, or 6.1%, from $1,799.4 million in 2001.  The 6.1% sales
   growth was fueled by 20.4% sales growth at Eldon.  The primary reasons
   for the increase were sales gains at strategic accounts, new product
   introductions (including the Sharpie{R} Chisel Tip and Liquid Paper{R}
   Backtracker{TM}), and growth in existing Paper Mate{R} pens,
   Sharpie{R} permanent markers and Colorific{R} product lines.

   Operating income for 2002 was $323.3 million, an increase of $45.0
   million, or 16.2%, from $278.3 million in 2001.  The increase is
   primarily related to productivity improvements and increased margin
   from new products, partially offset by continued investments in
   divisional growth initiatives, primarily television advertising for
   the Sharpie{R} and Paper Mate{R} brands.

   IRWIN

   Net sales for 2002 were $1,727.3 million, an increase of $344.7
   million, or 24.9%, from $1,382.6 million in 2001.  Excluding $318.3
   million in sales from the American Tool acquisition, sales increased
   $26.4 million, or 1.9%.  Sales growth was fueled primarily by 14.0%
   sales growth at the BernzOmatic division offset by a decline of 1.3%
   at the Levolor/Kirsch division.  The American Tool acquisition
   integration continues on plan.

   Operating income for 2002 was $136.4 million, an increase of $9.9
   million, or 7.8%, from $126.5 million in 2001.  Excluding $24.6
   million in operating income from the American Tool acquisition,



   operating income decreased $14.7 million, or 11.6%.  The decrease in
   operating income was primarily due to product price reductions and
   continued investment in sales and marketing growth initiatives, as
   well as start-up costs related to the American Tool acquisition,
   partially offset by cost savings from productivity initiatives.

   CALPHALON HOME

   Net sales for 2002 were $1,225.5 million, an increase of $63.8
   million, or 5.5%, from $1,161.7 million in 2001.  Sales growth related
   primarily to Calphalon and Cookware Europe divisions related to new
   product introductions and existing product sales at strategic
   accounts, partially offset by product price reductions.

   Operating income for 2002 was $119.5 million, a decrease of $0.6
   million, or 0.5%, from $120.1 million in 2001.  The slight decrease in
   operating income was due primarily to product price reductions and
   costs related to marketing growth initiatives, offset by cost savings
   from productivity initiatives and new and existing product growth.

   2001 VERSUS 2000

   Net sales for 2001 were $6,909.3 million, representing a decrease of
   $25.4 million, or 0.4%, from $6,934.7 million, in 2000.  The sales
   decline was primarily due to shelf space losses at key customers and a
   significant downturn in the U.S. economy, partially offset by $498.5
   million of sales contributions from Paper Mate/Parker (acquired
   December 2000).

   Gross income as a percentage of net sales in 2001 was 27.0%, or
   $1,862.7 million, versus 26.3%, or $1,826.0 million, in 2000. Gross
   income includes restructuring related and other charges relating to
   integration costs of recent acquisitions of $7.4 million ($4.7 million
   after taxes) and $7.9 million ($4.9 million after taxes) in 2001 and
   2000, respectively.  The gross income improvement is primarily due to
   the December 29, 2000 acquisition of the Paper Mate/Parker
   business.  Excluding this acquisition, gross income margins were flat.
   The implementation of the productivity initiative throughout the
   Company in 2001 maintained gross income margin percentages at 2000
   levels despite significant increased fixed costs as production at the
   Company's manufacturing facilities was slowed in an effort to reduce
   inventories (net inventories decreased $148.8 million during 2001).

   Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in 2001 were
   16.9% of net sales, or $1,168.2 million, versus 13.0%, or $899.4
   million, in 2000.  SG&A includes charges relating to integration costs
   of recent acquisitions of $12.0 million ($7.7 million after taxes) and
   $8.8 million ($5.4 million after taxes) in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
   The increase in SG&A is a result of the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition
   and planned investments in marketing initiatives, including the





   Company's Strategic Account Management and Phoenix Programs, supporting
   the Company's brand portfolio and strategic account strategy.

   During 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of
   $66.7 million associated with the Company's strategic restructuring
   plan.  The restructuring plan is intended to streamline the Company's
   supply chain to ensure its position as the best-cost global provider
   throughout the Company's product portfolio.  The plan consists of
   reducing worldwide headcount over the three years beginning in 2001,
   and includes consolidating duplicate manufacturing facilities.  As
   part of this plan, the Company incurred employee severance and
   termination benefit costs for approximately 1,700 employees.
   Additionally, the Company incurred facility exit costs related
   primarily to the closure of 14 facilities (four at Rubbermaid, one at
   Sharpie, six at Irwin and three at Calphalon Home).  See Footnote 3
   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of these
   charges.

   During 2000, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of
   $43.0 million related primarily to the continued Rubbermaid
   integration and plant closures at Irwin.  The Company incurred
   employee severance and termination benefit costs related to
   approximately 700 employees terminated in 2000.  Such costs included
   severance and government mandated settlements for facility closures at
   Rubbermaid Europe, change in control payments made to former
   Rubbermaid executives, employee terminations at the domestic
   Rubbermaid divisions and severance at  Irwin.  The Company incurred
   merger transaction costs related primarily to legal settlements for
   Rubbermaid's 1998 sale of a former division and other merger related
   contingencies resolved in 2000.  Additionally, the Company incurred
   facility and other exit costs related primarily to the closure of five
   European Rubbermaid facilities, three window furnishings facilities as
   well as the exit of various Rubbermaid product lines. See Footnote 3
   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of these
   charges.

   For the year ended December 31, 2001, goodwill amortization as a
   percentage of net sales was 0.8%, or $56.9 million, versus 0.7%, or
   $51.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2000.  The increase in
   goodwill amortization is a result of additional goodwill associated
   with the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition in December 2000.

   Operating income in 2001 was 8.3% of net sales, or $570.9 million,
   versus 12.0% of net sales, or $831.7 million, in 2000.  Operating
   income includes restructuring and other charges of $86.1 million
   ($54.8 million after taxes) and $59.7 million ($36.7 million after
   taxes) in 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The decrease in operating
   margins was primarily due to planned investment in marketing
   initiatives supporting the Company's brand portfolio and strategic
   account strategy.





   Net nonoperating expenses in 2001 were 2.3% of net sales, or $155.0
   million, versus 2.1%, or $146.2 million, in 2000. The increased
   expenses in 2001 are a result of the Company's increased average level
   of debt, partially offset by lower interest rates.

   The effective tax rate was 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001
   versus 38.5% in the prior year.  See Footnote 12 to the Consolidated
   Financial Statements for an explanation of the effective tax rate.

   Net income for 2001 was $264.6 million compared to net income of
   $421.6 million in 2000.  Basic and diluted earnings per share in 2001
   decreased 36.9% to $0.99 from $1.57 in 2000. Net income includes pre-
   tax restructuring and other charges of $86.1 million ($54.8 million
   after taxes) and $59.7 million ($36.7 million after taxes) in 2001 and
   2000, respectively.  The decrease in net income and earnings per
   share for 2001 was primarily due to internal sales declines, planned
   investment in the Company's marketing initiatives and increased
   restructuring charges to streamline the Company's manufacturing
   network.

   RUBBERMAID

   Net sales for 2001 were $2,565.6 million, a decrease of $243.7
   million, or 8.7%, from $2,809.3 million in 2000.  The 8.7% sales
   decline was primarily due to the Little Tikes and Graco divisions.
   The primary reasons for the overall sales decline were losses of shelf
   space at key customers and a significant downturn in the U.S. economy.

   Operating income for 2001 was $200.9 million, a decrease of $125.3
   million, or 38.4%, from $326.2 million in 2000.  The decrease resulted
   primarily from reduced margins caused by the sales declines mentioned
   above and planned investment in marketing initiatives to support the
   Company's brand portfolio and Strategic Account Management Program.

   SHARPIE

   Net sales for 2001 were $1,799.4 million, an increase of $375.9
   million, or 26.4%, from $1,423.5 million in 2000.  Excluding $498.5
   million in sales from the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition, sales
   decreased $122.6 million, or 8.6%.  The primary reasons for the
   overall sales decline was softness in the commercial channel and a
   significant downturn in the U.S. economy.

   Operating income for 2001 was $278.3 million, an increase of $27.9
   million, or 11.1%, from $250.4 million in 2000.  The increase resulted
   primarily from increased sales from the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition
   offset by reduced margins caused by sales declines in our core
   business and planned investment in marketing initiatives to support
   the Company's brand portfolio and Strategic Account Management
   Program.

   IRWIN

   Net sales for 2001 were $1,382.6 million, a decrease of $72.4 million,
   or 5.0%, from $1,455.0 million in 2000.  The 5.0% sales decline was
   primarily due to the Levolor/Kirsch and Mainland Europe divisions.
   The primary reasons for the overall sales decline was losses of shelf
   space at key customers and a significant downturn in the economy.

   Operating income for 2001 was $126.5 million, a decrease of $80.7
   million, or 38.9%, from $207.2 million in 2000.  The decrease resulted
   primarily from reduced margins caused by the sales declines mentioned
   above, product pricing reductions and planned investment in marketing
   initiatives to support the Company's brand portfolio and Strategic
   Account Management Program.






   CALPHALON HOME

   Net sales for 2001 were $1,161.7 million, a decrease of $85.2 million,
   or 6.8%, from $1,246.9 million in 2000.  The 6.8% sales decline was
   primarily due to the Mirro/Calphalon division.  The primary reasons
   for the overall sales decline was losses of shelf space at key
   customers and a significant downturn in the economy.

   Operating income for 2001 was $120.1 million, a decrease of $52.8
   million, or 30.5%, from $172.9 million in 2000.  The decrease resulted
   primarily from reduced margins caused by the sales declines mentioned
   above and planned investment in marketing initiatives to support the
   Company's brand portfolio and Strategic Account Management Program.

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

   SOURCES

   The Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital resources
   include cash provided by operations and use of available borrowing
   facilities.

   Cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was $868.9 million
   compared to $865.4 million in 2001 and $623.5 million in 2000.  The
   increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to improved earnings
   before non-cash charges and improved working capital management,
   principally in the area of accounts payable.  In 2002, the Company
   generated $136.0 million in positive cash flow by better management of
   accounts payable.  As a result, the Company generated free cash flow
   (defined by the Company as cash provided by operating activities less
   capital expenditures and dividends) of $392.4 million compared to
   $391.6 million in 2001 and $81.8 million in 2000.

   The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of
   credit with various banks that are available for short-term financing.
   Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines of credit are subject
   to the discretion of the lender. The Company's lines of credit do not
   have a material impact on the Company's liquidity.  Borrowings under
   the Company's lines of credit at December 31, 2002 totaled $25.2
   million.

   On March 14, 2002, the Company issued $500.0 million of Senior Notes
   with five-year and ten-year maturities.  The $500.0 million Senior
   Notes consist of $250.0 million in 6.00% Senior Notes due 2007 and
   $250.0 million in 6.75% Senior Notes due 2012.  On December 20, 2002,
   the Company issued $250.0 million of Senior Notes.  The seven-year
   Senior Notes were issued at 4.625% and pay interest semi-annually on
   June 15 and December 15 until final maturity on December 15, 2009.
   The proceeds of these issuances were used to pay down commercial
   paper.  These issuances are reflected in the outstanding amount of
   medium-term notes and the entire amount is considered to be long-term
   debt.



   The Company completed a $1,300.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit
   Facility (the "Revolver") on June 14, 2002, replacing the existing
   $1,300.0 million revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to
   terminate in August 2002.  The Revolver consists of a $650.0 million
   364-day credit agreement and a $650.0 million five-year credit
   agreement.  At December 31, 2002, there were no borrowings under the
   Revolver.

   In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to
   $1,300.0 million of commercial paper.  The Revolver provides the
   committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper.
   Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount
   available for borrowing under the Revolver.  At December 31, 2002,
   $140.0 million (principal amount) of commercial paper was outstanding.
   Because $650.0 million of the Revolver expires in June 2007, the
   entire $140.0 million is classified as long-term debt.

   The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of
   interest rate terms.  The Revolver requires, among other things, that
   the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness
   to Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreement.  The agreement
   also limits Subsidiary Indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2002, the
   Company was in compliance with this agreement.

   On September 18, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with a
   financial institution creating a financing entity that is consolidated
   in the Company's financial statements.  Under the agreement, the
   Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity
   to sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the Company's
   United States trade receivables to the financing entity.  In the
   quarter ended September 30, 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0
   million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution.
   Those preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed before the
   Company can have access to the financing entity's receivables.  The
   receivables and the corresponding $450.0 million preferred debt issued
   by the subsidiary to the financial institution are recorded in the
   consolidated accounts of the Company.  The proceeds of this debt were
   used to pay down commercial paper issued by the Company.  Because this
   debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to be long-term
   debt.  The provisions of the debt agreement allow the entire
   outstanding debt to be called upon certain events including the
   Company's debt rating falling below investment grade and certain
   levels of accounts receivable write-offs.  As of December 31, 2002,
   the Company was in compliance with the agreement.  As of December 31,
   2002 and 2001, the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold
   under the agreement was $738.2 million and $689.3 million,
   respectively.

   In August 2002, the Company elected to terminate certain interest rate
   swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities and received cash
   of $25.0 million.  Of this amount, $20.8 million represents the fair
   value of the swaps that were terminated and the remainder represents



   interest receivable on the swaps.  The cash received relating to the
   fair value of the swaps was included as an operating activity in the
   Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The unamortized fair value gain
   on the terminated interest rate swaps is accounted for as long-term
   debt.  As of December 31, 2002, the unamortized gain was $18.4
   million, of which $5.3 million is classified as current portion of
   long-term debt.  The unamortized gain will be amortized as a reduction
   to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt.

   In August 2002, the Company entered into several new interest rate
   swap agreements to replace the terminated interest rate swap
   agreements.  These new interest rate swaps convert certain fixed rate
   debt into floating rate debt based on a notional principal amount of
   $500.0 million.

   A $500.0 million universal shelf registration statement became
   effective in July 2002 under which debt and equity securities may be
   issued.  As of December 31, 2002, approximately $250.0 million in debt
   securities had been issued under this shelf registration statement.
   In January 2003, approximately $200.8 million in equity securities
   were issued pursuant to the shelf registration.  See Footnote 16 to
   the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

   USES

   The Company's primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include
   acquisitions, dividend payments and capital expenditures.

   Cash used for acquisitions was $242.2 million, $107.5 million and
   $597.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
   respectively.  The Company continues to invest in businesses and
   product lines that present a strategic fit with the Company's existing
   businesses.  See Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
   for further details.

   The Company repaid $901.5 million, $819.0 million and $428.2 million
   of notes payable and long-term debt for the years ended December 31,
   2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The Company's ability to pay down
   debt was due primarily to current year cash earnings and continued
   focus on working capital management.  Cash used for restructuring
   activities was $58.0 million, $49.7 million and $32.9 million in the
   years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Such cash
   payments primarily represent employee termination benefits and
   facility exit costs.

   Capital expenditures were $252.1 million, $249.8 million and $316.6
   million in the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
   respectively.  The Company continues to invest in new product
   development and productivity.  Aggregate dividends paid were $224.4
   million, $224.0 million and $225.1 million in the years ended December
   31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.




   Retained earnings decreased $428.1 million in the year ended December
   31, 2002.  The reduction in retained earnings is due primarily to the
   $514.9 million, net of tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge taken
   in 2002 and the payment of $224.4 million in dividends, partially
   offset by current year earnings.

   Working capital at December 31, 2002 was $465.6 million compared to
   $316.8 million at December 31, 2001.  The current ratio at December
   31, 2002 was 1.18:1 compared to 1.13:1 at December 31, 2001.  The
   increase in working capital and the current ratio is due to the
   American Tool acquisition, and a reduction in the current portion of
   long-term debt.

   Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash
   equivalents, and total capitalization includes total debt, company-
   obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a
   subsidiary trust and stockholders' equity) was .47:1 at December 31,
   2002 compared to .43:1 at December 31, 2001.  The increase in total
   debt to total capitalization is due to the American Tool acquisition,
   which was funded by the issuance of commercial paper.

   The Company believes that cash provided by operations and available
   borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the
   cash needs of existing businesses; however, certain events, such as
   significant acquisitions, could require additional external financing.
   In January 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of the American
   Saw & Mfg. Co. ("American Saw").  The purchase price of $450.0 million
   was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.  See Footnote 16
   to the Consolidated Financial Statement for further details.

   MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY

   The recent dramatic decline in U.S. equity markets has reduced the
   value of the Company's pension plan assets.  As a result, the
   Company's pension plan, which historically has had an over-funded
   position, currently is under-funded.  In accordance with SFAS No. 87,
   "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," the Company recorded an
   additional minimum pension liability adjustment at December 31, 2002.
   Based on plan asset values at the measurement date, the approximate
   effect of this non-cash adjustment was to increase the pension
   liability by $114.5 million, with a corresponding charge to equity,
   net of taxes, of $71.0 million.  The direct charge to stockholders'
   equity did not affect net income, but is included in other
   comprehensive income.  The Company remains confident that its pension
   plan has the appropriate long-term investment strategy and the
   Company's liquidity position is expected to remain strong.

   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote
   1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  As disclosed in Footnote
   1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with



   generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
   estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts
   reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes.
   Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute
   certainty.  Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the
   exercise of judgment.  Actual results inevitably will differ from
   those estimates, and such differences may be material to the
   Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following sections describe
   the Company's critical accounting policies.

   GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

   Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill
   and Other Intangible Assets."  Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and
   intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized
   but remain subject to periodic impairment tests in accordance with the
   statements.

   The Company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and
   indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter.  In addition,
   the Company tests for impairment periodically if events or
   circumstances occur subsequent to the Company's annual impairment
   tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
   reporting unit below its carrying amount.  In conducting this
   impairment test, the Company estimates the future cash flows of its
   businesses to which the goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles
   relate.  These cash flows are then discounted at rates ranging from 9%
   to 13%, reflecting the respective specific industry's cost of capital.
   The discounted cash flows are then compared to the carrying amount of
   the reporting unit to determine if an impairment exists.  If, upon
   review, the fair value is less than the carrying value of the
   reporting unit, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair
   value.  Reporting units are typically operating segments or operations
   one level below operating segments for which discrete financial
   information is available and for which segment management regularly
   reviews the operating results.  Because there usually is a lack of
   quoted market prices for the reporting units, the fair value usually
   is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using
   discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset
   group.  The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and
   related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of
   future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available
   information at the date of review.

   As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill
   impairment charge of $538.0 million in the first quarter of 2002 (with
   an after-tax charge totaling $514.9 million).

   The accounting estimate related to goodwill and other indefinite life
   intangible assets is highly susceptible to change from period to
   period because it requires management to make estimates of future cash
   flows and changes in cost of capital related to each of its business



   units.  There is potential for economic, regulatory, or other
   conditions that could adversely affect the ability of each business
   unit to generate future cash flows.  Should these conditions
   deteriorate, there is the potential for additional impairment losses
   to be incurred, and such losses could be material to the Company's
   Consolidated Financial Statements.

   LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

   As described in Footnote 15 to the Company's Consolidated Financial
   Statements, the Company is involved in legal proceedings in the
   ordinary course of its business.  These proceedings include claims for
   damages arising out of use of the Company's products, allegations of
   infringement of intellectual property, commercial disputes and
   employment matters as well as environmental matters.  Some of the
   legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory
   damages, and a few proceedings purport to be class actions.

   In determining the appropriate level of legal reserves, the Company
   uses outside and internal counsel to evaluate the potential exposure
   on specific claims.  The Company evaluates the range of estimated loss
   for each specific case and determines the probable exposure based on
   historical experience and the advice of counsel.  While the Company
   believes it is adequately reserved for legal exposures, management
   cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these cases,
   including any amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts
   reserved.  The ultimate outcome of these cases could exceed the
   amounts recorded and such losses could be material to the Company's
   Consolidated Financial Statements.

   The Company is involved in various matters concerning federal and
   state environmental laws and regulations, including matters in which
   the Company has been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency and certain state environmental agencies as a potentially
   responsible party ("PRP") at contaminated sites under the Federal
   Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
   ("CERCLA") and equivalent state laws.

   In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has
   considered several factors, including: the extent of the Company's
   volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other PRPs;
   the kind of waste; the terms of existing cost sharing and other
   applicable agreements; the financial ability of other PRPs to share in
   the payment of requisite costs; the Company's prior experience with
   similar sites; environmental studies and cost estimates available to
   the Company; the effects of inflation on cost estimates; and the
   extent to which the Company's and other parties' status as PRPs is
   disputed.

   The Company's estimate of environmental response costs associated with
   these matters as of December 31, 2002 ranged between $19.4 million and
   $24.6 million.  As of December 31, 2002, the Company had a reserve



   equal to $22.0 million for such environmental response costs in the
   aggregate. No insurance recovery was taken into account in determining
   the Company's cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company's cost
   estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value
   purposes, except with respect to two long-term (30 year) operations
   and maintenance CERCLA matters which are estimated at present value.

   Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental
   investigations and response activities, the possibility that the
   Company could be identified as a PRP at sites identified in the future
   that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the
   possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses acquired,
   actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from the Company's
   estimates.  The ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the
   amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be
   material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

   PRODUCT LIABILITY RESERVES

   The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that
   includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and
   aggregate risk transfer insurance.  The Company uses historical loss
   experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of
   significant individual files, application of risk transfer programs,
   and guidance from internal and external legal counsel in determining
   required product liability reserves.  As a result of the most recent
   analysis, the Company has estimated these reserves at $27.8 million.
   While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these
   claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts
   recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be material to
   the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

   RECOVERY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

   The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based
   on a combination of factors.  When aware of a specific customer's
   inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of
   bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating
   results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve
   for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the
   Company reasonably believes is collectible.  The Company also records
   reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of
   factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and
   historical collection experience.  If circumstances related to
   specific customers change, the Company's estimates of the
   recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.

   INVENTORY RESERVES

   The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and
   slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the
   cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon



   assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  If actual
   market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
   management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

   REVENUE RECOGNITION

   The Company recognizes revenues and freight billed to customers, net
   of provisions for cash discounts, returns, volume or trade customer
   discounts, co-op advertising and other sales discounts, upon shipment
   to customers when all substantial risks of ownership change. In
   accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 00-10,
   "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs," the Company
   records amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling
   as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and handling as a cost
   of products sold.  See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial
   Statements.

   further information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.

   INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

   The Company's non-U.S. business continues to grow at a steady pace.
   This growth outside the U.S. has been fueled by recent international
   acquisitions, primarily in Europe.  For the years ended December 31,
   2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company's non-U.S. business accounted for
   approximately 27%, 27% and 25% of net sales, respectively (see
   Footnote 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Growth of both
   U.S. and non-U.S. businesses is shown below for the years ended
   December 31, (IN MILLIONS):

                    ========    ========    ========      ===        ===

   MARKET RISK

   The Company's market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates,
   foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. Pursuant
   to the Company's policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative
   financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse




   changes in market prices. The Company does not hold or issue
   derivative instruments for trading purposes.

   The Company's primary market risk is interest rate exposure, primarily
   in the United States. The Company manages interest rate exposure
   through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and
   floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest
   rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for
   qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in
   interest expense.

   The Company's foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes
   hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial
   transaction exposures of one-year duration or less. The Company
   focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form:

        *    offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows,
        *    structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with
             appropriate levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net
             investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion
             risk,
        *    converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S.
             dollars or the relevant functional currency and
        *    avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the
             appropriate functional currency.

   In addition, the Company utilizes short-term forward contracts to
   hedge commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and losses
   related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany
   transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying
   transactions. Derivative instruments are recorded on the Company's
   Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, and any changes in fair
   value of these instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Statement
   of Income or other comprehensive income.

   Due to the diversity of its product lines, the Company does not have
   material sensitivity to any one commodity. The Company manages
   commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of
   its vendor contracts.

   The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic
   loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in either
   interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value-at-risk
   estimation model. The value-at-risk model uses historical foreign
   exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and
   correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in
   fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including
   substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding
   equity-method investments).  The fair value losses shown in the table
   below do not have an impact on current results of operations or
   financial condition, but are shown as an illustration of the impact of
   potential adverse changes in interest rates.  The following table



   indicates the calculated amounts for each of the years ended December
   31, 2002 and 2001 (IN MILLIONS):



   The 95% confidence interval signifies the Company's degree of
   confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses
   shown above.  The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that
   interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the
   Company's favor. The value-at-risk model assumes that all movements in
   these rates will be adverse.  Actual experience has shown that gains
   and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly
   unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over
   an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered
   projections of future losses, because actual results may differ
   significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets.

   EURO CURRENCY CONVERSION

   On January 1, 1999, the "Euro" became the common legal currency for 11
   of the 15 member countries of the European Union.  On that date, the
   participating countries fixed conversion rates between their existing
   sovereign currencies ("legacy currencies") and the Euro. On January 4,
   1999, the Euro began trading on currency exchanges and became
   available for noncash transactions, if the parties elected to use it.
   On January 1, 2001, another country (Greece) also adopted the Euro,
   fixing the conversion rate against their legacy currency.  The legacy
   currencies remained legal tender through December 31, 2001.  On January
   1, 2002, participating countries introduced Euro-denominated bills and
   coins, and effective July 1, 2002, legacy currencies were no longer
   legal tender.

   All businesses in participating countries are now required to conduct
   all transactions in the Euro and must convert their financial records
   and reports to be Euro-based.  The Company has completed this
   conversion process and has deemed its information systems to be Euro
   compliant.  As a result of the Euro conversion, the Company
   experienced no adverse impact to its business or financial condition
   on a consolidated basis.

   MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   The management of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. is responsible for the
   accuracy and internal consistency of all information contained in this
   annual report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements.
   Management has followed those generally accepted accounting principles
   that it believes to be most appropriate to the circumstances of the
   Company, and has made what it believes to be reasonable and prudent
   judgments and estimates where necessary.

   Newell Rubbermaid Inc. operates under a system of internal accounting
   controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that its financial
   records are accurate, that the assets of the Company are protected and
   that the financial statements fairly present the financial position
   and results of operations of the Company.  The internal accounting
   control system is tested, monitored and revised as necessary.

   Five directors of the Company, not members of management, serve as the
   Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and are the principal means
   through which the Board oversees the performance of the financial
   reporting duties of management.  The Audit Committee meets with
   management and the Company's independent auditors several times a year
   to review the results of the external audit of the Company and to
   discuss plans for future audits. At these meetings, the Audit
   Committee also meets privately with the independent auditors to assure
   its free access to them.

   The Company's independent auditors, Ernst and Young LLP, audited the
   financial statements prepared by the management of Newell Rubbermaid
   Inc. Their opinion on these statements is presented below.

   The Company's prior independent accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP, was
   convicted on June 15, 2002 of one count of obstruction of justice
   arising from the government's investigation of Enron Corporation.
   Events arising out of the conviction of Arthur Andersen LLP, as well
   as the volume of civil lawsuits against it, have adversely affected
   the ability of Arthur Andersen LLP to satisfy claims, if any, arising
   from its providing of auditing services to the Company, including
   claims that may arise out of Arthur Andersen LLP's audit of the
   Company's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2001
   and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001,
   which are included in this Report.  A copy of a report previously
   issued by Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with the Company's Annual
   Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 is presented
   below.  Arthur Andersen LLP has not reissued this opinion.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

   Board of Directors and Shareholders
   Newell Rubbermaid Inc.

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Newell
   Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2002, and the
   related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity,
   and cash flows for the year then ended.  Our audit also included the
   financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a).  These
   financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
   Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
   these financial statements and schedule based on our audit. The
   financial statements and schedule of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. as of
   December 31, 2001 and for each of the two years in the period ended
   December 31, 2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased
   operations and whose report dated January 25, 2002 expressed an
   unqualified opinion on those statements before the disclosure and
   restatement adjustments described in Notes 1 and 14, respectively.

   We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
   accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan
   and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
   financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
   includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
   and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
   assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
   made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
   statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a
   reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the 2002 financial statements referred to above
   present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
   position of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. at December 31, 2002, and the
   consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year
   then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
   in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related 2002 financial
   statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
   statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
   the information set forth therein.

   As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
   effective January 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of
   accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets to conform with
   FASB Statement No. 142.

   As discussed above, the financial statements of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.
   as of December 31, 2001, and for each of the two years in the period
   ended December 31, 2001, were audited by other auditors who have
   ceased operations. As described in Note 1, these financial statements
   have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by
   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (Statement) No. 142,



   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, which was adopted by the Company
   as of January 1, 2002.  Our audit procedures with respect to the
   disclosures in Note 1 with respect to 2001 and 2000 included (a)
   agreeing the previously reported net income to the previously issued
   financial statements and the adjustments to reported net income
   representing amortization expense (including any related tax effects)
   recognized in those periods related to goodwill to the Company's
   underlying records obtained from management, and (b) testing the
   mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net income to
   reported net income, and the related earnings-per-share amounts.
   Also, as described in Note 14, the Company changed the composition of
   its reportable segments in 2002, and the amounts in the 2001 and 2000
   financial statements relating to reportable segments have been
   restated to conform to the 2002 composition of reportable segments. We
   audited the adjustments that were applied to restate the disclosures
   for reportable segments reflected in the 2001 and 2000 financial
   statements. Our procedures included (a) agreeing the adjusted amounts
   of segment revenues, operating income and assets to the Company's
   underlying records obtained from management, and (b) testing the
   mathematical accuracy of the reconciliations of segment amounts to the
   consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, such adjustments
   are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were not
   engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000
   financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such
   disclosures and adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an
   opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000 financial
   statements taken as a whole.

                  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   To the Stockholders of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.:

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newell
   Rubbermaid Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of
   December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 and the related consolidated
   statements of income, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income
   and cash flows for the years then ended.  These consolidated financial
   statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility
   of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to
   express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial Statements and
   schedule based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
   generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that
   we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
   whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
   audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
   amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
   includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
   estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
   financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide
   a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
   fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newell
   Rubbermaid Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and
   1999 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
   years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
   accepted in the United States.

   Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
   basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in
   Part IV Item 14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K is presented for the purposes
   of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and

     CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND
     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS)























   FOOTNOTE 1
   ----------

   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS:  Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the "Company") is a
   global manufacturer and full-service marketer of name-brand consumer
   products serving the needs of volume purchasers, including discount
   stores and warehouse clubs, home centers and hardware stores, and
   office superstores and contract stationers.  The Company's basic
   business strategy is to merchandise a multi-product offering of
   everyday consumer products, backed by an obsession with customer
   service excellence and new product development, in order to achieve
   maximum results for its stockholders.  The Company's multi-product
   offering consists of name-brand consumer products in four business
   segments: Rubbermaid; Sharpie; Irwin and Calphalon Home.

   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The Consolidated Financial Statements
   include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned
   subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
   transactions.

   USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of these financial statements
   require the use of certain estimates by management in determining the
   Company's assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related
   disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain 2001 and 2000 amounts have been
   reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.

   REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales of merchandise and freight billed to
   customers, net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer
   discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), co-op advertising and
   other sales related discounts, are recognized upon shipment to
   customers and when all substantial risks of ownership change.  In
   accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 00-10,
   "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs," the Company
   records amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling
   as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and handling as a cost
   of products sold.

   Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101 clarified the existing
   accounting rules for revenue recognition and did not impact the
   Company's net sales for any years presented.  In conformity with SAB
   No. 101, revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances
   are satisfied: pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price
   is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and
   delivery has occurred.

   In August 2001, the EITF issued EITF No. 01-09, "Accounting for
   Consideration Given by Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of Vendor's
   Product" which codified and reconciled the Task Force's consensus in



   EITF No. 00-014, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," EITF No.
   00-22, "Accounting for Points and Certain Other Time Based Sales
   Incentives or Volume Based Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers of Free
   Products or Services to be Delivered in the Future," and EITF No. 00-
   25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to
   a Reseller of the Vendor's Products."  These EITF's prescribe guidance
   regarding the timing of recognition and income statement
   classification of costs incurred for certain sales incentive programs
   to resellers and end consumers.  EITF No. 01-09 did not impact results
   of operations because the Company recognizes sales incentives upon
   recognition of revenue and classifies them as reductions of gross
   revenue and recognizes free goods as a cost of goods sold when
   shipped, both in accordance with the prescribed rules.

   DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  The Company's
   financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts
   receivable, notes payable, short and long-term debt and Company-
   obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Securities of a
   Subsidiary Trust.  The fair value of these instruments approximates
   carrying values due to their short-term duration, except as follows:

        Derivative Instruments:  The fair value of the Company's
        derivative instruments is recorded in the Consolidated Balance
        Sheets and is described in more detail in Footnote 7.

        Long-term Debt: The fair value of the Company's long-term debt
        issued under the medium-term note program was $1,490.3 million at
        December 31, 2002, based on quoted market prices. All other
        significant long-term debt is pursuant to floating rate
        instruments whose carrying amounts approximate fair value.

        Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred
        Securities of a Subsidiary Trust:  The fair value of the $500.0
        million company-obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible
        preferred securities of a subsidiary trust was $452.5 million at
        December 31, 2002, based on quoted market prices.

   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash and highly liquid short-term
   investments have a maturity of three months or less.

   ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Allowances for doubtful accounts at
   December 31 totaled $75.0 million in 2002, $57.9 million in 2001 and
   $36.1 million in 2000.

   On a regular basis, the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and
   establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination
   of specific customer circumstances as well as credit conditions and
   based on a history of write-offs and collections.  A receivable is
   considered past due if payments have not been received within the
   agreed upon invoice terms.





   INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
   value. Cost of certain domestic inventories (approximately 62%, 63%
   and 59% of total inventories at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
   respectively) was determined by the "last-in, first-out" ("LIFO")
   method; for the balance, cost was determined using the "first-in,
   first-out" ("FIFO") method. If the FIFO inventory valuation method had
   been used exclusively, inventories would have increased by $14.2
   million and $20.1 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
   Inventory reserves (excluding LIFO reserves) at December 31 totaled
   $130.3 million in 2002 and $117.3 million in 2001. The components of
   net inventories were as follows as of December 31, (IN MILLIONS):

                                           2002        2001
                                           ----        ----
      Materials and supplies               $308.8      $356.5
      Work in process                       174.9       150.5
      Finished products                     712.5       606.8
                                         --------    --------
                                         $1,196.2    $1,113.8
                                         ========    ========

   OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS: The Company had a 49.5% ownership
   interest in American Tool Companies, Inc., a manufacturer of hand
   tools and power tool accessory products marketed primarily under the
   Irwin{R}, Vise-Grip{R}, Quick-Grip{R} and Marathon{R} trademarks until
   its acquisition in 2002. See Footnote 2 for further discussion.  This
   investment had been accounted for under the equity method with a net
   investment of $79.5 million at December 31, 2001.  The Company's share
   of undistributed earnings of the investment included in consolidated
   retained earnings was $43.9 million at December 31, 2001.

   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:  Replacements and improvements are
   capitalized.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
   expense.  Depreciation expense is calculated to amortize, principally
   on the straight-line basis, the cost of the depreciable assets over
   their depreciable lives.  Maximum useful lives determined by the
   Company are: buildings and improvements (20-40 years) and machinery
   and equipment (3-12 years).  Property, plant and equipment consisted
   of the following as of December 31, (IN MILLIONS):

                                               2002             2001

      Land                                     $64.7            $59.5
      Buildings and improvements               785.4            732.5
      Machinery and equipment                2,652.9          2,546.2
                                            --------         --------
                                             3,503.0          3,338.2
      Accumulated depreciation              (1,690.2)        (1,649.0)
                                            --------         --------
                                            $1,812.8         $1,689.2
                                            ========         ========





   As of December 31, 2002, the Company accrued $26.1 million for
   equipment received but not paid for.  This amount has been excluded
   from the line items:  expenditures for property, plant and equipment
   and the change in accounts payable in the Consolidated Statement of
   Cash Flows.

   TRADE NAMES AND GOODWILL:  Effective January 1, 2002, the Company
   adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142,
   "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."  Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill
   and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer
   be amortized, but will be subject to periodic impairment tests in
   accordance with the statements.  Other intangible assets will continue
   to be amortized over their useful lives.

   Pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, all amortization expense on
   trade names and goodwill ceased on January 1, 2002.  As of January 1,
   2002, the Company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill
   and indefinite lived intangible assets and recorded a pre-tax goodwill
   impairment charge of $538.0 million in the first quarter of 2002 (with
   an after-tax charge totaling $514.9 million).  In determining this
   amount of goodwill impairment, the Company measured the impairment
   loss as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill (which included
   the carrying amount of trademarks) over the implied fair value of
   goodwill (which excluded the fair value of identifiable trademarks).
   The Company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and
   indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter.  In addition,
   the Company will test again for impairment if events or circumstances
   occur subsequent to the Company's annual impairment tests that would
   more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below
   its carrying amount.  There were no additional impairment charges for
   2002.

   Goodwill represents the excess of cost over identifiable net assets of
   businesses acquired.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, trade
   names acquired in business combinations were not typically recognized
   separately from goodwill.  Through the year ended December 31, 2001,
   trade names and goodwill were amortized over 40 years and other
   identifiable intangible assets were amortized over 5 to 20 years.
   Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, certain trade names have not been
   "carved-out" from goodwill as they had not been identified and
   measured at fair value in the initial recording of a business
   combination.













   A summary of changes in the Company's goodwill during the year ended
   December 31, 2002 is as follows (IN MILLIONS):

      Balance at December 31, 2001                          $2,069.7
      Acquisitions and adjustments -

      Balance at December 31, 2002                          $1,847.3
                                                            ========

   The results of operations on a pro forma basis for the year ended
   December 31, restated as though the amortization of trade names and
   goodwill had been discontinued on January 1, 2000, are as follows for
   the year ended December 31 (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS):





   LONG-LIVED ASSETS:  Subsequent to acquisition, the Company
   periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred
   that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets
   may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of long-lived
   assets may not be recoverable. If factors indicate that long-lived
   assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses
   an estimate of the relevant business' undiscounted net cash flow over
   the remaining life of the long-lived assets in measuring whether the
   carrying value is recoverable.  An impairment loss would be measured
   by reducing the carrying value to fair value, based on a discounted
   cash flow analysis.

   In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
   issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment of Disposal of Long-
   Lived Assets."  This statement established a single accounting model
   for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and provides
   additional implementation guidance for assets to be held and used and
   assets to be disposed of other than by sale. The statement supersedes
   SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
   for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" and amends the accounting and
   reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion
   No. 30 related to the disposal of a segment of a business. The
   statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
   2001.  The Company adopted SFAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002, and the
   standard did not have a material impact on its financial position or
   results of operations.

   PRODUCT WARRANTIES:  In the normal course of business, the Company
   offers warranties for a variety of its products.  The specific terms
   and conditions of the warranties vary depending upon the specific
   product and markets in which it was sold.  The Company accrues for
   the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale based on
   historical experience.

   OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES:  Accrued liabilities included the following
   as of December 31, (IN MILLIONS):

                                                  2002              2001
                                                  ----              ----
   Customer accruals                              $289.6           $224.9
   Accrued purchase accounting (1)                 119.0            134.7
   Accrued self-insurance liability                 91.5             84.3
   Accrued restructuring (2)                        79.4             28.2
   Other                                           585.9            464.0
                                                --------           ------
            Other accrued liabilities           $1,165.4           $936.1
                                                ========           ======

  (1)  See Footnote 2 for further details.
  (2)  See Footnote 3 for further details.




   Customer accruals are promotional allowances and rebates given to
   customers in exchange for their selling efforts. The self-insurance
   accrual is primarily casualty liabilities such as workers'
   compensation, general and product liability and auto liability and is
   estimated based upon historical loss experience.

   FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:  Foreign currency balance sheet accounts
   are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at
   fiscal year end.  Income and expenses are translated at the average
   rates of exchange in effect during the year.  The related translation
   adjustments are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive
   income. International subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary
   economies translate nonmonetary assets at historical rates, while net
   monetary assets are translated at current rates, with the resulting
   translation adjustment included in net income as other nonoperating
   (income) expenses.  Foreign currency transaction losses were $4.2
   million, $1.9 million and $1.9 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
   respectively.

   ADVERTISING COSTS:  The Company expenses advertising costs as
   incurred, including cooperative advertising programs with customers.
   Total cooperative advertising expense was $218.6 million, $196.8
   million and $209.2 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
   Cooperative advertising is recorded in the Consolidated Financial
   Statements as a reduction of sales because it is viewed as part of the
   negotiated price of products. All other advertising costs are charged
   to selling, general and administrative expenses and totaled $140.6
   million, $100.3 million and $80.0 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
   respectively.

   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS:  Research and development costs
   relating to both future and present products are charged to selling,
   general and administrative expenses as incurred.  These costs
   aggregated $87.6 million, $67.2 million and $49.4 million in 2002,
   2001 and 2000, respectively.

   EARNINGS PER SHARE:  The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per
   share for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
   respectively, is shown below (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA):



   FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS:  The Company's stock option plans are
   accounted for under APB Opinion No. 25. As a result, the Company
   grants fixed stock options under which no compensation cost is
   recognized. Had compensation cost for the plans been determined
   consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income and earnings
   per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts
   for the year ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA):

                                               2002        2001       2000
                                               ----        ----       ----
   Net (loss)/income:
     As reported                             ($203.4)     $264.6     $421.6
     Fair value option expense                 (16.3)      (15.5)     (11.1)
                                              ------      ------     ------
     Pro forma                               ($219.7)     $249.1     $410.5
                                              ======      ======     ======

    Basic (loss)/earnings per share:
      As reported                              ($0.76)      $0.99      $1.57
      Pro forma                                 (0.82)       0.93       1.53

    Diluted (loss)/earnings per share:
      As reported                              ($0.76)      $0.99      $1.57
      Pro forma                                 (0.82)       0.93       1.53





   Because the SFAS No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to
   options granted prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma
   compensation cost may not be representative of that to be expected in
   future years.

   COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Comprehensive income and accumulated other
   comprehensive income encompass net income, foreign currency
   translation adjustments, net losses on derivative instruments and net
   minimum pension liability adjustments in the Consolidated Statements
   of Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income. The following table
   displays the components of accumulated other comprehensive income or
   loss (IN MILLIONS):



   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:  In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
   No. 141, "Business Combinations."  SFAS No. 141 requires all business
   combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using
   the purchase method of accounting.  All acquisitions initiated after
   June 30, 2001 by the Company have been accounted for as purchases,
   thus, there was no effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial
   Statements upon adoption of this standard.

   In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs
   Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."  SFAS No. 146 addresses
   financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
   disposal activities included in restructurings.  This Statement
   eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit
   costs as defined in EITF Issue 94-3, and requires that liabilities for
   exit activities be recognized when incurred instead of at the exit
   activity commitment date.  Additionally, SFAS No. 146 requires
   recognition of one-time severance benefits that require employees to
   render future service beyond a minimum retention period over the
   future service period. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS
   No. 146, effective January 1, 2003.  The impact of this accounting
   standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's
   earnings or financial position.  The Company generally has recorded
   restructuring liabilities for exit costs as incurred, however, under
   certain operating leases, exit costs were recorded when management
   committed to the exit plan under the guidance of EITF Issue 94-3.
   With respect to severance benefits, the Company believes the majority



   of its severance agreements require only a minimum or no retention
   period or are made pursuant to pre-existing plans as defined by SFAS
   No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."

   In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for Stock-
   Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure."  SFAS No. 148
   provides alternative methods for transition to SFAS No. 123's fair
   value method of accounting for stock based compensation.  It also
   amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and APB Opinion No.
   25 to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting
   policies of the effect of the entity's accounting policy with respect
   to stock-based compensation on reported net income and earnings per
   share.  SFAS No. 148 does not amend SFAS No. 123 to require companies
   to account for stock options using the fair value method, however, it
   does require all companies to adopt the disclosure provisions.  The
   Company has adopted the disclosure provisions.

   ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESS

   2002:
   On April 30, 2002, the Company completed the purchase of American Tool
   Companies, Inc. ("American Tool"), a leading manufacturer of hand
   tools and power tool accessories.  The Company had previously held a
   49.5% stake in American Tool, which had been accounted for under the
   equity method prior to acquisition.  This purchase marked a
   significant expansion and enhancement of the Company's product lines
   and customer base, launching it squarely in the estimated $10 billion-
   plus global market for hand tools and power tool accessories.  The
   preliminary purchase price was $467 million, which included $197
   million for the majority 50.5% ownership stake, the repayment of $243
   million in American Tool debt and $27 million of transaction costs.
   At the time of acquisition, the Company paid off American Tool's
   senior debt, senior subordinated debt and debt under their revolving
   credit agreement.  The Company has obtained third party valuations of
   certain financial positions and allocated the purchase price to the
   identifiable assets.  During the third quarter, the Company recorded
   nonoperating expenses of $8.7 million for transaction costs associated
   with the acquisition.

   The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price
   allocation of American Tool assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
   the date of acquisition.

   In 2000, the Company acquired the following:

   For these and for other minor acquisitions made in 2000, the Company
   paid $635.2 million in cash and assumed $15.0 million of debt.

   The transactions summarized above were accounted for as purchases;
   therefore, results of operations are included in the accompanying
   Consolidated Financial Statements since their respective acquisition
   dates.  The acquisition costs were allocated on a preliminary basis to
   the fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
   The Company's integration plans include exit costs for certain plants
   and product lines and employee termination costs.  The final
   adjustments to the purchase price allocations are not expected to be





   material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The preliminary
   purchase price allocations for the 2002 acquisitions and the finalized
   purchase price allocations for the 2001 and 2000 acquisitions resulted
   in trade names and goodwill of approximately $321.3 million.

   In 2002, the Company began to formulate integration plans for American
   Tool and other minor acquisitions as of their respective dates of
   acquisition.  The integration plans for these acquisitions resulted in
   integration plan liabilities of $27.5 million for facility and other
   exit costs, $17.7 million for employee severance and termination
   benefits and $33.9 million for other pre-acquisition contingencies.
   The purchase prices for the 2002 acquisitions have been allocated to
   the fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
   The Company's integration plans include exit costs for certain plants
   and product lines, as well as employee termination costs.  The final
   adjustments to the purchase price allocations are not expected to be
   material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  As of December 31,
   2002, $39.9 million of integration plan reserves remain related to the
   2001 and 2000 acquisitions.

   None of the 2001 acquisitions were included in the pro forma
   calculations because their effect was immaterial.  The unaudited
   consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31,
   2002 and 2001 on a pro forma basis, as though the 2002 acquisition of

   WITHDRAWN DIVESTITURE

   On June 18, 2001, the Company announced an agreement for the sale of
   Anchor Hocking ("Anchor").  On January 14, 2002, the Federal Trade
   Commission (the "FTC") filed a complaint seeking to enjoin the sale of
   Anchor.  On January 21, 2002, the Company signed an amended agreement
   with the buyer to divest Anchor, excluding the foodservice business
   because the FTC alleged the sale of Anchor to the current buyer could
   reduce competition in the market for glassware in the foodservice
   industry.  On April 22, 2002, the U.S. District Court for the
   District of Columbia granted the FTC's motion for a preliminary
   injunction.

   On June 10, 2002, the Company announced that it had withdrawn plans to
   sell its Anchor Hocking glass business and instead will continue to
   operate the business as part of its broad housewares portfolio.
   Transaction costs approximating $13.6 million were recorded as
   nonoperating expenses in 2002.

   RESTRUCTURING COSTS

   Certain expenses incurred in the reorganization of the Company's
   operations are considered to be restructuring expenses.  Pre-tax
   restructuring costs consisted of the following for the year ended
   December 31, (IN MILLIONS):



   Restructuring provisions were determined based on estimates prepared
   at the time the restructuring actions were approved by management.  An
   analysis of the Company's restructuring plan reserves is as follows
   (IN MILLIONS):



   The facility and other exit cost reserves of $36.1 million at December
   31, 2002 are primarily related to future minimum lease payments on
   vacated facilities and closure costs related to fifty-two facilities
   and administrative offices.  As of December 31, 2002, severance
   reserves for the employees impacted by the facility closures
   approximated $41.1 million.

   ----

   During 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   associated with the Company's strategic restructuring plan.  The
   restructuring plan is intended to streamline the Company's supply
   chain to ensure its position as the best-cost global provider
   throughout the Company's product portfolio.  The plan consists of
   reducing worldwide headcount over the three years beginning in 2001,
   and includes consolidating duplicate manufacturing facilities.  As
   part of this plan, the Company incurred employee severance and
   termination benefit costs for approximately 3,100 employees, including
   manufacturing, sales and support personnel.  Additionally, the Company
   incurred facility exit costs related primarily to the closure of 43
   facilities (seven at Rubbermaid, eight at Sharpie, fourteen at Irwin,
   twelve at Calphalon Home and two corporate administrative offices).

   ----

   During 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   associated with the Company's strategic restructuring plan.  As part
   of this plan, the Company incurred employee severance and termination
   benefit costs for approximately 1,700 employees.  Additionally, the
   Company incurred facility exit costs related primarily to the closure
   of 14 facilities (four at Rubbermaid, one at Sharpie, six at Irwin and
   three at Calphalon Home).

   ----

   During 2000, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   related primarily to the continued Rubbermaid integration and plant
   closures at Irwin.  The Company incurred employee severance and
   termination benefit costs related to approximately 700 employees
   terminated in 2000.  Such costs included severance and government
   mandated settlements for facility closures at Rubbermaid Europe,
   change in control payments made to former Rubbermaid executives,
   employee terminations at the domestic Rubbermaid divisions and


   severance at Irwin.  The Company incurred merger transaction costs
   related primarily to legal settlements for Rubbermaid's 1998 sale of a
   former division and other merger related contingencies resolved in
   2000.  Additionally, the Company incurred facility and other exit
   costs related primarily to the closure of five European Rubbermaid
   facilities, three window furnishings facilities as well as the exit of
   various Rubbermaid product lines.

   CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

   The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of
   credit with various banks that are available for short-term financing.
   Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines of credit are subject
   to the discretion of the lender. The Company's lines of credit do not
   have a material impact on the Company's liquidity.  The following is a
   summary of borrowings under foreign and domestic lines of credit as of

                                           ========             ========

   The aggregate maturities of long-term debt outstanding are as follows
   as of December 31, 2002 (IN MILLIONS):

    2003      2004     2005      2006      2007    Thereafter      Total

   $424.0     $5.5     $26.4    $154.2    $390.7    $1,279.8     $2,280.6

   The medium-term notes, revolving credit agreement (and related
   commercial paper) and mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred
   securities are all unsecured.

   The Company had outstanding a total of $1,680.9 million in medium-term
   notes.  The original maturities on these notes range from 3 to 30
   years at an average interest rate of 5.2%.  Of the outstanding
   principal amounts, $420.8 million is classified as current portion of
   long-term debt, with the remainder classified as long-term debt.

   On March 14, 2002, the Company issued $500.0 million of Senior Notes
   with five-year and ten-year maturities.  The $500.0 million Senior
   Notes consist of $250.0 million in 6.00% Senior Notes due 2007 and
   $250.0 million in 6.75% Senior Notes due 2012.  On December 20, 2002,
   the Company issued $250.0 million of Senior Notes.  The seven-year
   Senior Notes were issued at 4.625% and pay interest semi-annually on
   June 15 and December 15 until final maturity on December 15, 2009.
   The proceeds of these issuances were used to pay down commercial
   paper.  These issuances are reflected in the outstanding amount of
   medium-term notes noted above and the entire amount is considered to
   be long-term debt.

   The Company completed a $1,300.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit
   Facility (the "Revolver") on June 14, 2002, replacing the existing



   $1,300.0 million revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to
   terminate in August 2002.  The Revolver consists of a $650.0 million
   364-day credit agreement and a $650.0 million five-year credit
   agreement.  At December 31, 2002, there were no borrowings under the
   Revolver.

   In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue
   commercial paper.  The Revolver provides the committed backup
   liquidity required to issue commercial paper.  Accordingly, commercial
   paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing
   under the Revolver.  At December 31, 2002, $140.0 million (principal
   amount) of commercial paper was outstanding.  Because $650.0 million
   of the Revolver expires in June 2007, the entire $140.0 million is
   classified as long-term debt.

   The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of
   interest rate terms.  The Revolver requires, among other things, that
   the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness
   to Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreement.  The agreement
   also limits Subsidiary Indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2002, the
   Company was in compliance with this agreement.

   On September 18, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with a
   financial institution creating a financing entity that is consolidated
   in the Company's financial statements.  Under the agreement, the
   Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity
   to sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the Company's
   United States trade receivables to the financing entity.  In the
   quarter ended September 30, 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0
   million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution.
   Those preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed before the
   Company can have access to the financing entity's receivables.  The
   receivables and the corresponding $450.0 million preferred debt issued
   by the subsidiary to the financial institution are recorded in the
   consolidated accounts of the Company.  The proceeds of this debt were
   used to pay down commercial paper issued by the Company.  Because this
   debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to be long-term
   debt.  The provisions of the debt agreement allow the entire
   outstanding debt to be called upon certain events including the
   Company's debt rating falling below investment grade and certain
   levels of accounts receivable write-offs.  As of December 31, 2002,
   the Company was in compliance with the agreement.  As of December 31,
   2002 and 2001, the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold
   under the agreement was $738.2 million and $689.3 million,
   respectively.

   In August 2002, the Company elected to terminate certain interest rate
   swap agreements prior to their scheduled maturities and received cash
   of $25.0 million.  Of this amount, $20.8 million represents the fair
   value of the swaps that were terminated and the remainder represents
   interest receivable on the swaps.  The cash received relating to the
   fair value of the swaps was included as an operating activity in the



   Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  The unamortized fair value gain
   on the terminated interest rate swaps is accounted for as long-term
   debt.  As of December 31, 2002, the unamortized gain was $18.4
   million, of which $5.3 million is classified as current portion of
   long-term debt.  The unamortized gain will be amortized as a reduction
   to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt.

   In August 2002, the Company entered into several new interest rate
   swap agreements to replace the terminated interest rate swap
   agreements.  These new interest rate swaps convert certain fixed rate
   debt into floating rate debt based on a notional principal amount of
   $500.0 million.

   A $500.0 million universal shelf registration statement became
   effective in July 2002 under which debt and equity securities may be
   issued.  As of December 31, 2002, $250.0 million in debt securities
   had been issued under this shelf registration statement.  In January
   2003, approximately $200.8 million of equity securities were issued
   pursuant to the shelf registration.  See Footnote 16 for further
   details.

   COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED
   SECURITIES OF A SUBSIDIARY TRUST

   The Company fully and unconditionally guarantees 10.0 million shares
   of 5.25% convertible preferred securities issued by a 100% owned
   finance subsidiary of the Company, which are callable at 102.625% of
   the liquidation preference, decreasing over time to 100% by December
   2007.  Each of these "Preferred Securities" is convertible into 0.9865
   of a share of Company common stock, and is entitled to a quarterly
   cash distribution at the annual rate of $2.625 per share.

   The proceeds of the Preferred Securities were invested in $500.0
   million of the Company 5.25% Junior Convertible Subordinated
   Debentures.  The Debentures are the sole assets of the subsidiary
   trust, mature on December 1, 2027, bear interest at an annual rate of
   5.25%, are payable quarterly and became redeemable by the Company
   beginning in December 2001. The Company may defer interest payments on
   the Debentures for a period of up to 20 consecutive quarters, during
   which period distribution payments on the Preferred Securities are
   also deferred. Under this circumstance, the Company may not declare or
   pay any cash distributions with respect to its common or preferred
   stock or debt securities that do not rank senior to the Debentures.

   As of December 31, 2002, the Company has not elected to defer interest
   payments.  The $500.0 million of the Preferred Securities is
   classified as Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible
   Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary Trust in the Consolidated Balance
   Sheet.

   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   At the beginning of 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133,
   "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  This
   statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance
   sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value.  Any changes
   in fair value of these instruments are recorded in the income
   statement or other comprehensive income.  The impact of adopting SFAS
   No. 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in a cumulative after-tax gain of
   approximately $13.0 million, recorded in accumulated other
   comprehensive income.  The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133
   did not materially impact the results of operations.

   Derivative financial instruments are used only to manage certain
   interest rate and foreign currency risks.  These instruments include
   interest rate swaps, long-term cross currency interest rate swaps, and
   short-term forward exchange contracts.

   At December 31, 2002, the Company had interest rate swaps designated
   as cash flow hedges with an outstanding notional principal amount of
   $350.0 million, with accrued interest payable of $0.9 million.  At
   December 31, 2002, the Company had these swaps serve as a means to
   mitigate the risk of rising interest rates in future periods by
   converting certain floating rate debt instruments into fixed rate
   debt.  Gains and losses on these instruments, to the extent that the
   hedge relationship has been effective, are deferred in other
   comprehensive income and recognized in interest expense over the
   period in which the Company recognizes interest expense on the related
   debt instrument.  Any ineffectiveness on these instruments is
   immediately recognized in interest expense in the period that the
   ineffectiveness occurs.  During 2002, the ineffectiveness related to
   these instruments was insignificant.  The Company expects
   approximately $3.3 million of the losses, net of tax, deferred in
   other comprehensive income to be recognized in earnings in 2003.  At
   December 31, 2002, the Company also had interest rate swaps designated
   as fair value hedges with an outstanding notional principal amount of
   $500.0 million, with accrued interest receivable of $2.7 million.
   These fair value hedges qualify for the "shortcut method" because
   these hedges are deemed to be perfectly effective.  The maximum length
   of time over which the Company is hedging its interest rate exposure
   through the use of interest rate swap agreements is seven years.

   The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts to manage foreign
   exchange risk related to both known and anticipated intercompany
   transactions and third-party commercial transaction exposures of
   approximately one year in duration or less.  The Company also utilizes
   long-term cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge long-term
   intercompany transactions.  The maturities on these long-term cross
   currency interest rate swaps range from three to five years.  At



   December 31, 2002, the Company had long-term cross currency interest
   rate swaps with an outstanding notional principal amount of $319.5
   million, with accrued interest receivable of $0.2 million.

   Gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts,
   which hedge intercompany transactions or third-party commercial
   transactions, are deferred in other comprehensive income with a
   corresponding asset or liability until the underlying transaction
   occurs and are considered to have a cash flow hedging relationship.
   The gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive
   income will be reclassified to earnings upon completion of the
   underlying transaction being hedged.  The net loss recognized in 2002
   for matured cash flow forward exchange contracts was $1.5 million, net
   of tax, which was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
   The Company estimates that $0.1 million of gains, net of tax, deferred
   in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized in
   earnings in 2003.

   Derivative instruments used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to
   market with the corresponding gains or losses included in accumulated
   other comprehensive income and are considered to have a fair value
   hedging relationship.  Any ineffectiveness associated with the fair
   value hedges is classified to the income statement.  The net gain
   recognized in 2002 for forward exchange contracts and cross currency
   interest rate swaps was $0.4 million, net of tax, which was recognized
   as part of interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

   The following table summarizes the Company's forward exchange
   contracts and long-term cross currency interest rate swaps in U.S.
   dollars by major currency and contractual amount. The "buy" amounts
   represent the U.S. equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign
   currencies, and the "sell" amounts represent the U.S. equivalent of
   commitments to sell foreign currencies according to the local needs of
   the subsidiaries. The contractual amounts of significant short-term
   forward exchange contracts and long-term cross currency interest rate
   swaps and their fair values as of December 31, were as follows (IN
   MILLIONS):






   The Company's short-term forward exchange contracts and long-term
   cross currency interest rate swaps do not subject the Company to risk
   due to foreign exchange rate movement, because gains and losses on
   these instruments generally offset gains and losses on the assets,
   liabilities, and other transactions being hedged.  The Company does
   not obtain collateral or other security to support derivative
   financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit
   standing of the counterparties.

   LEASES

   The Company leases manufacturing and warehouse facilities, real
   estate, transportation, data processing and other equipment under
   leases that expire at various dates through the year 2011.  Rent
   expense was $123.3 million, $112.0 million and $102.9 million in 2002,
   2001 and 2000, respectively.

   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND RETIREMENT PLANS

   As of December 31, 2002, the Company continued to maintain various
   deferred compensation plans with varying terms.  The total liability
   associated with these plans was $56.9 million and $52.3 million as of
   December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  These liabilities are
   included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
   Sheet. These plans are partially funded with asset balances of $42.9
   million and $41.9 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
   respectively.  These assets are included in Other Noncurrent Assets in
   the Consolidated Balance Sheet.





   Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted a deferred compensation
   plan pursuant to which certain management and highly compensated
   employees are eligible to defer up to 50% of their regular
   compensation and up to 100% of their bonuses, and nonemployee board
   members are eligible to defer up to 100% of their directors
   compensation.  The compensation deferred under this plan along with
   earnings is fully vested at all times.

   The Company has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"),
   which is a nonqualified defined benefit plan pursuant to which the
   Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key
   employees upon retirement based upon the employees' years of service
   and compensation.  The SERP is being funded through a trust agreement
   with the Northern Trust Company, as trustee, that owns life insurance
   policies on key employees.  At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the life
   insurance contracts had a cash surrender value of $66.2 million and
   $56.0 million, respectively.  These assets are included in Other
   Noncurrent Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The amount of
   coverage is designed to provide sufficient reserves to cover all costs
   of the plan.  The projected benefit obligation was $68.6 million and
   $59.8 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  The SERP
   liabilities are included in the pension table below; however, the
   Company's investment in the life insurance contracts are excluded from
   the table as they do not qualify as plan assets under SFAS No. 87,
   "Employers' Accounting for Pensions."

   The Company and its subsidiaries have noncontributory pension, profit
   sharing and contributory 401(k) plans covering substantially all of
   their foreign and domestic employees. Pension plan benefits are
   generally based on years of service and/or compensation. The Company's
   funding policy is to contribute not less than the minimum amounts
   required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
   amended, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or local
   statutes to assure that plan assets will be adequate to provide
   retirement benefits. The Company's common stock comprised $67.4
   million and $56.6 million of noncontributory pension plan assets at
   December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

   The Company's matching contributions to the profit sharing plans were
   $21.4 million, $15.4 million and $14.5 million for the years ended
   December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

   In addition, several of the Company's subsidiaries currently provide
   retiree health care and life insurance benefits for certain employee
   groups.











   The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan
   assets and funded status of the Company's noncontributory pension
   plans, SERP and postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, (IN

    Fair value of plan assets                     418.4            307.0

   Assumed health care cost trends have been used in the valuation of
   postretirement benefits. The trend rate is 10% (for retirees under age
   65) and 12% (for retirees over age 65) in 2002, declining to 6% for
   all retirees in 2009 and thereafter.  In 2001, the Company increased
   the medical care cost trend rate due to significant increases in
   actual medical costs.





   The health care cost trend rate significantly affects the reported
   postretirement benefit costs and obligations. A one percentage point
   change in the assumed rate would have the following effects (IN
   MILLIONS):

                                              1% Increase     1% Decrease

   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

   On February 7, 2000, the Company announced a stock repurchase program
   of up to $500.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock.
   During 2000, the Company repurchased 15.5 million shares of its common
   stock at an average price of $26.00 per share, for a total cash price
   of $403.0 million under the program. The repurchase program remained
   in effect until December 31, 2000 and was financed through the use of
   working capital and commercial paper.

   Each share of common stock includes a stock purchase right (a
   "Right"). Each Right will entitle the holder, until the earlier of
   October 31, 2008 or the redemption of the Rights, to buy the number of
   shares of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise
   price of $200.00, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
   The Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15%
   or more of voting power of the Company or announces a tender offer
   after which it would hold 15% or more of the Company's voting power.
   The Rights held by the 15% stockholder would not be exercisable in
   this situation.

   Furthermore, if, following the acquisition by a person or group of 15%
   or more of the Company's voting stock, the Company was acquired in a
   merger or other business combination or 50% or more of its assets were
   sold, each Right (other than Rights held by the 15% stockholder) would
   become exercisable for that number of shares of common stock of the
   Company (or the surviving company in a business combination) having a
   market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.

   The Company may redeem the Rights at $0.001 per Right prior to the
   occurrence of an event that causes the Rights to become exercisable
   for common stock.

   STOCK OPTIONS

   The Company's Amended and Restated 1993 Stock Option Plan expired by
   its terms on December 31, 2002, and no further stock options can be
   granted under that plan.  For options previously granted under that
   plan, the option exercise price equaled the common stock's closing
   price on the date of grant, options vest over a five-year period and
   expire ten years from the date of grant.  In February 2003, the
   Company's Board of Directors approved, subject to approval of Company
   stockholders, a 2003 Stock Plan.  The 2003 Plan will provide for
   grants of up to an aggregate of 15.0 million stock options, stock
   awards and performance shares (except that no more than 3.0 million of
   those grants may be stock awards and performance shares).  Under the
   2003 Plan, the option exercise price will equal the common stock's
   closing price on the date of grant.  Options will vest over five years
   (which may be shortened to no less than three years) and expire ten
   years from the date of grant.  Also under the 2003 Plan, none of the
   restrictions on stock awards will lapse earlier than the third
   anniversary of the date of grant.

   The following summarizes the changes in the number of shares of common
   stock under option, including options to acquire common stock
   resulting from the conversion of options under pre-merger Rubbermaid
   option plans (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT EXERCISE PRICES):





   Options outstanding at December 31, 2002 (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT EXERCISE
   PRICES):



   The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
   using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
   assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively:
   risk-free interest rate of 4.0%, 5.1% and 6.5%; expected dividend
   yields of 3.0%, 3.0% and 3.0%; expected lives of 6.9, 9.0 and 9.0
   years; and expected volatility of 32%, 28% and 28%.

   ("NOL") carry forwards of approximately $487.9 million that expire at
   various times beginning in 2005 and some of which carry forward
   without expiration.  The potential tax benefits associated with those
   foreign net operating losses are approximately $150.2 million.  The
   valuation allowance increased $18.7 million during 2002 to $104.0
   million at December 31, 2002.  This increase was primarily the result
   of an increase of certain foreign net operating losses during the year

   INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION

   In the first quarter of 2002, the Company announced the realignment of
   its operating segment structure.  This realignment reflects the
   Company's focus on building large consumer brands, promoting
   organizational integration and operating efficiencies and aligning the
   businesses with the Company's strategic account management strategy.
   The four operating segments have been named for leading worldwide
   brands in the Company's product portfolio.  The realignment
   streamlines what had previously been five operating segments (prior
   years' segment data has been reclassified to conform to the current
   segment structure).  In 2002, the Company renamed its Parker/Eldon,
   Calphalon/Wearever and Levolor/Hardware segments as the Sharpie,
   Calphalon Home and Irwin segments, respectively, for public reporting.
   The Company's segment results are as follows as of December 31, (IN
   MILLIONS):



   (1)  Sales to Wal*Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to
        approximately 15% of consolidated net sales in each of the years
        ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Sales to no other
        customer exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for any year.
   (2)  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
   (3)  Operating income is net sales less cost of products sold and
        selling, general and administrative expenses. Certain
        headquarters expenses of an operational nature are allocated to
        business segments and geographic areas primarily on a net sales





        basis. Trade names and goodwill amortization was considered a
        corporate expense in 2001 and 2000 and not allocated to business
        segments.
   (4)  Restructuring costs are recorded as both Restructuring Costs and
        as part of Cost of Products Sold in the Consolidated Statements
        of Operations (refer to Footnote 3 for additional detail.)
   (5)  Corporate assets primarily include trade names and goodwill,
        equity investments and deferred tax assets.
   (6)  Transfers of finished goods between geographic areas are not
        significant.

   LITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES

   The Company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of
   its business.  These proceedings include claims for damages arising
   out of use of the Company's products, allegations of infringement of
   intellectual property, commercial disputes and employment matters as
   well as the environmental matters described below.  Some of the legal
   proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory
   damages, and a few proceedings purport to be class actions.

   As of December 31, 2002, the Company was involved in various matters
   concerning federal and state environmental laws and regulations,
   including matters in which the Company has been identified by the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental
   agencies as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at contaminated
   sites under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
   Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and equivalent state laws.

   In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has
   considered several factors, including: the extent of the Company's
   volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other PRPs;
   the kind of waste; the terms of existing cost sharing and other
   applicable agreements; the financial ability of other PRPs to share in
   the payment of requisite costs; the Company's prior experience with
   similar sites; environmental studies and cost estimates available to
   the Company; the effects of inflation on cost estimates; and the
   extent to which the Company's and other parties' status as PRPs is
   disputed.

   The Company's estimate of environmental response costs associated with
   these matters as of December 31, 2002 ranged between $19.4 million and
   $24.6 million.  As of December 31, 2002, the Company had a reserve
   equal to $22.0 million for such environmental response costs in the
   aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other
   noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. No
   insurance recovery was taken into account in determining the Company's
   cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company's cost estimates or
   reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except



   with respect to two long-term (30 year) operations and maintenance
   CERCLA matters which are estimated at present value.

   Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental
   investigations and response activities, the possibility that the
   Company could be identified as a PRP at sites identified in the future
   that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the
   possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses acquired,
   actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from the Company's
   estimates.

   Although management of the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome
   of these legal proceedings with certainty, it believes that the
   ultimate resolution of the Company's legal proceedings, including any
   amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts reserved, will
   not have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial
   Statements.

   In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
   Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
   Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (the Interpretation).
   The Interpretation requires a guarantor to make significant new
   disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the
   guarantee is remote.  The recognition and measurement provisions of
   the Interpretation are effective for guarantees issued or modified
   after December 31, 2002.  The disclosure provisions of the
   Interpretation are effective for financial statements with periods
   ended subsequent to December 15, 2002.  In the normal course of
   business and as part of its acquisition and divestiture strategy, the
   Company may provide certain representation and indemnifications
   related to legal, environmental, product liability, tax or other types
   of issues.  Based on the nature of these representations and
   indemnifications, it is not possible to predict the maximum potential
   payments under all of these agreements due to the conditional nature
   of the Company's obligations and the unique facts and circumstances
   involved in each particular agreement.  Historically, payments made by
   the Company under these agreements did not have a material effect on
   the Company's business, financial condition or results of operation.

   As of December 31, 2002, the Company has identified and quantified
   exposures under these representations and indemnifications of
   approximately $44 million, which expires in 2006.  As of December 31,
   2002, no amounts have been recorded on the balance sheet related to
   these indemnifications, as the risk of loss is considered remote.

   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

   Effective January 1, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of
   American Saw & Mfg. Co. ("American Saw"), a leading manufacturer of
   power tool accessories and hand tools marketed under the Lenox brand.
   The purchase price was approximately $450 million paid for through the
   issuance of commercial paper. The transaction structure permits the
   deduction of goodwill for tax purposes.  We estimate the present value
   of the future tax benefit to be $85 million, which effectively reduces
   the purchase price to $365 million.  American Saw had 2001 revenues of
   approximately $185 million and will become part of the Irwin operating
   segment.

   In January 2003, the Company completed the sale of 6.67 million shares
   of its common stock at a public offering price of $30.10 per share
   pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement that was
   previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The net
   proceeds of $200.1 million were used to reduce the Company's
   commercial paper borrowings.

   On March 27, 2003, the Company sold its Cosmolab business, a division
   of the Sharpie segment.  In 2002, sales of the division approximated
   $50 million.  The Company expects to record a non-cash pre-tax loss of
   approximately $20 million in the first quarter of 2003.






























   ITEM 9.   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
   -------   AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
             -----------------------------------------------------------

   On March 25, 2002, the Company terminated the engagement of Arthur
   Andersen LLP ("Arthur Andersen") as its independent auditor.  The
   decision to terminate the engagement of Arthur Andersen was
   recommended by the Company's Audit Committee and approved by its Board
   of Directors.  Arthur Andersen's report on the consolidated financial
   statements of the Company for each of the years ended December 31,
   2001 and 2000, did not contain any adverse opinion or a disclaimer of
   opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit
   scope or accounting principles.  During the years ended December 31,
   2001 and 2000, and the interim period between December 31, 2001 and
   March 25, 2002, there were no disagreements between the Company and
   Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
   financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which
   disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Arthur Andersen,
   would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the
   disagreements in connection with its report.  During the years ended
   December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the interim period between December
   31, 2001 and March 25, 2002, there were no reportable events (as
   defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the
   Securities and Exchange Commission).  A letter from Arthur Andersen
   was included in the Report on Form 8-K/A filed by the Company on April
   3, 2002.

   The Company engaged Ernst & Young LLP as its new independent auditor
   effective March 25, 2002.  The engagement of Ernst & Young was
   recommended by the Company's Audit Committee and approved by its Board
   of Directors.  During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, and
   the interim period between December 31, 2001 and March 25, 2002, the
   Company did not consult with Ernst & Young regarding (i) the
   application of accounting principles to a specified transaction,
   either completed or proposed, (ii) the type of audit opinion that
   might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements
   or (iii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as
   described above) or a reportable event.
