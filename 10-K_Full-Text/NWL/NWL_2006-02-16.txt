GENERAL

Newell Rubbermaid is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer products and their
commercial extensions, serving a wide array of retail channels including department stores,
discount stores, warehouse clubs, home centers, hardware stores, commercial distributors, office
superstores, contract stationers, automotive stores, and baby superstores. The Company’s basic
business strategy is to create brands that matter by marketing a multi-product offering of everyday
consumer and commercial products, backed by a focus on innovation and customer service excellence,
in order to achieve maximum results for its stockholders. The Company’s multi-product offering
consists of well known name-brand consumer products and their commercial extensions in five
business segments: Cleaning & Organization; Office Products; Tools & Hardware; Home Fashions; and
Other. The Company’s financial objectives are to achieve above-average sales and earnings per
share growth, maintain a superior return on investment and maintain a conservative level of debt.

The Company’s six transformational strategic initiatives are as follows: Productivity,
Streamlining, New Product Development, Marketing, Strategic Account Management, and Collaboration.

Productivity is the initiative to continuously reduce the cost of manufacturing a product in order
to become the best-cost supplier. Streamlining is the commitment to reduce non-strategic costs
throughout the organization. New Product Development represents the commitment to develop and
introduce cutting-edge, innovative new products at best-cost to meet end-user needs. The
Marketing initiative represents the Company’s commitment to transform from a “push” to “pull”
marketing organization, focusing on the end-user. The Strategic Account Management initiative
represents the Company’s program to allocate resources to those strategic retailers the Company
believes will continue to grow profitably with us in the future. Collaboration is the Company’s
initiative for the divisional operating units to work together to maximize economies of scale and
reapply best practices.

Refer to the forward-looking statements section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the Company’s forward-looking
statements.

GROWTH STRATEGY

The Company’s growth strategy emphasizes internal growth and acquisitions.

Internal Growth

The Company focuses on internal growth principally by introducing innovative new products, entering
new domestic and international markets, adding new customers, cross-selling existing product lines
to current customers and supporting its U.S.-based customers’ international expansion. Internal
growth is defined by the Company as growth from continuing businesses owned more than one year and
minor acquisitions.

Acquisition Strategy

The Company supplements internal growth by selectively acquiring businesses with prominent end-user
focused brands and improving the profitability of such businesses through the implementation of the
Company’s strategic initiatives. Other strategic criteria for an acquisition include: the
Company’s ability to grow the business; the ability to create strong, differentiated brands; its
importance to key customers; its relationship to existing product lines; its function as a low-cost
source of supply; its ability to provide the Company with an entrance into a new market; and the
extent to which the Company can improve operational efficiency through shared resources. In
addition, the Company will consider the business’ actual and potential impact on the Company’s
operating performance.

During 2005, the Company acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing
on-demand labeling solutions, from Esselte. The purchase price was approximately $730 million,
subject to adjustment for working capital and other items. The cash paid at closing was $706
million, reflecting a preliminary working capital adjustment relating to Esselte’s retention of
certain receivables, as well as an adjustment relating to a modification of the transaction
structure. The final purchase price is subject to further adjustment relating to changes in the
closing working capital. This acquisition strengthens the Company’s global leadership position in
the Office Products segment by expanding and enhancing the Company’s product lines and customer
base. See Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
acquisitions.

Selective Globalization

The Company is pursuing selective international opportunities to further its internal growth and
acquisition objectives. The growth of consumer goods economies and retail structures in several
regions outside the U.S., particularly Asia, Mexico and South America, makes them attractive to the
Company by providing selective opportunities to acquire businesses, develop partnerships with new
foreign customers and extend relationships with


the Company’s domestic customers whose businesses are growing internationally. The Company had
sales outside the U.S. of approximately 28%, 29%, and 28% of total sales in 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively.

DIVESTITURE AND PRODUCT LINE RATIONALIZATION

The Company’s divestiture and product line rationalization strategy emphasizes the divestiture of
businesses and rationalization of product offerings that do not meet the Company’s long-term
strategic goals and objectives.

The Company consistently reviews its businesses and product offerings, assesses their strategic fit
and seeks opportunities to divest non-strategic businesses. The criteria used by the Company in
assessing the strategic fit include: the ability to increase sales for the business; the ability to
create strong, differentiated brands; its importance to key customers; its relationship with
existing product lines; its impact to the market; and the business’ actual and potential impact on
the operating performance of the Company.

During 2005, the Company divested its Curver business and entered into an agreement to sell its
European Cookware business. The Company completed the divestiture of its European Cookware
business in January 2006. In 2004, the Company sold its U.S. picture frame business (Burnes), its
Anchor Hocking glassware business, its Mirro cookware business, its Panex Brazilian low-end
cookware business, its European picture frames business and its Little Tikes Commercial Playground
Systems business. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of
discontinued operations.

In 2005 and 2004, the Company rationalized $200 million and $257 million, respectively, in
low-margin product sales, primarily in the Cleaning & Organization segment. The Company’s decision
to exit these low margin product lines is consistent with its strategy to focus on high margin,
high potential opportunities that support the Company’s financial objectives.

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Productivity

The Company’s objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing a product on an ongoing basis. To
achieve productivity, the Company focuses on reducing purchasing costs, material handling costs,
manufacturing inefficiencies, removing excess overhead costs to reduce the overall cost of
manufacturing products and reducing the cost of distribution and transportation.

The deployment of Newell Operational Excellence (Newell OPEX) throughout the Company’s
manufacturing network is aimed at delivering the Company’s productivity targets. Newell OPEX is a
methodical process focused on lean manufacturing that includes installing the right manufacturing
and distribution metrics and driving improvements quarter after quarter. In addition to the cost
reductions, other key components of Newell OPEX are improved quality and service levels and the
reduction of inventory lead times.

In September 2005, the Company announced Project Acceleration aimed at strengthening and
transforming the Company’s portfolio. The project includes the approval by the Board of Directors
of a three-year restructuring plan, which commenced in December 2005. While the Board of Directors
has approved the overall plan, specific approval of each individual project is required prior to
commencing the action in accordance with the Company’s schedule of corporate authority. Project
Acceleration is designed to reduce manufacturing overhead by strategically sourcing and
manufacturing products in lower cost countries and includes the closure of approximately one-third
of the Company’s 80 manufacturing facilities (as of September 2005). The Company began executing
the plan in the fourth quarter of 2005. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on restructuring.

Streamlining

The streamlining initiative represents the Company’s commitment and focus on reducing non-strategic
costs throughout the organization. The Company is vigilant in creating a leaner organization that
is more flexible in its response time, both internally and externally.


New Product Development

The Company’s goal is to become the leader in introducing innovative and patented new products to
the consumer and commercial marketplace. The Company continues to implement a consistent, world
class new product development process across the organization that begins with identifying unmet
needs and developing solutions to deliver the ideal end-user experience. Excellence in new product
development will enhance brand image and help drive internal sales growth.

Over the last two years, the Company launched a number of innovative new products, including the
Sharpie

®

MINI and RT (retractable) permanent markers; IRWIN GrooveLock™ pliers; the Lenox

®

Gold™
utility knife; Rubbermaid

®

Paint Buddy™ paint touch-up tool; Rubbermaid

®

One™
Infused Anodized, Calphalon

®

One™ Nonstick and Contemporary Stainless lines of gourmet cookware and
Katana Series™ cutlery line; and Graco

®

Mosaic™ stroller and travel system.

Marketing

The Company’s objective is to develop long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships with its
customers and become their supplier and brand of choice. To achieve this goal, the Company has a
value-added marketing program that offers a family of leading brand name staple products, tailored
sales programs, innovative merchandising support, in-store services and responsive top management.

The Company’s marketing skills help customers stimulate store traffic and sales through timely
advertising and innovative promotions. The Company also assists customers in differentiating their
offerings by customizing products and packaging. Through self-selling packaging and displays that
emphasize good-better-best value relationships, retail customers are encouraged to trade up to
higher-value, best quality products.

The Company is also committed to increasing selective television or print advertising where
appropriate, increasing brand awareness and trial among end-users of the product. In 2005,
Sharpie

500 NASCAR race in 2006.

The Company’s in-store and end user marketing effort focuses largely on an extensive grass roots
marketing campaign, highlighted by the Phoenix Program. This program is an action-oriented field
sales force consisting of recent university graduates. The team works in the field, primarily
within our Strategic Account structure, performing in-store product demonstrations, event
marketing, on-shelf merchandising, interacting with the end-user, and maintaining an ongoing
relationship with store personnel. This initiative allows the Company to enhance product placement
and minimize stock outages and, together with the Strategic Account Management Program, to maximize
shelf space potential.

Strategic Account Management

The Strategic Account Management Program is the Company’s sales and marketing approach that focuses
growth efforts on strategic accounts with high long-term growth potential. Separate sales
organizations have been established to more effectively manage the relationship at the largest
strategic accounts. As part of this program, the Company established Sales President and Vice
President level positions to more effectively manage the relationships with these accounts. The
program allows the Company to present these customers with “one face” to enhance the Company’s
response time, understand the customer’s needs and support the best possible customer relationship.


Collaboration

Collaboration represents the Company’s focus on benefiting from the sharing of best practices and
the reduction of costs achieved through economies of scale. For example, functions, such as
purchasing and distribution and transportation, have been centralized to increase buying power
across the Company.

Additionally, certain administrative functions are centralized at the corporate level including
cash management, accounting systems, capital expenditure approvals, order processing, billing,
credit, accounts receivable, data processing operations and legal functions. Centralization
concentrates technical expertise in one location, making it easier to observe overall business
trends and manage the Company’s businesses.

OTHER INFORMATION

Multi-Product Offering

The Company’s broad product coverage in multiple product lines permits it to more effectively meet
the needs of its customers. With families of leading brand names and profitable and innovative new
products, the Company also can help volume purchasers sell a more profitable product mix. As a
potential single source for an entire product line, the Company can use program merchandising to
improve product presentation, optimize display space for both sales and income and encourage
impulse buying by retail customers.

Customer Service

The Company believes that one of the primary ways it distinguishes itself from its competitors is
through customer service. The Company’s ability to provide superior customer service is a result
of its information technology, marketing and merchandising programs designed to enhance the sales
and profitability of its customers and provide consistent on-time delivery of its products.

On-Time Delivery

A critical element of the Company’s customer service is consistent on-time delivery of products to
its customers. Retailers are pursuing a number of strategies to deliver the highest-quality,
best-cost products to their customers. A growing trend among retailers is to purchase on a
“just-in-time” basis in order to reduce inventory carrying costs and increase returns on
investment. As retailers shorten their lead times for orders, manufacturers need to more closely
anticipate consumer-buying patterns. The Company supports its retail customers’ “just-in-time”
inventory strategies through more responsive sourcing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities
and electronic communications. The Company currently manufactures the majority of its products and
has extensive experience in high-volume, cost-effective manufacturing.

Foreign Operations

Information regarding the Company’s 2005, 2004 and 2003 foreign operations and financial
information by geographic area is included in Footnote 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
and is incorporated by reference herein. Information regarding risks relating to the Company’s
foreign operations is set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this report and is incorporated by reference
herein.

Raw Materials

The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its
material requirements. The raw materials and various purchased components required for its
products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. The Company’s product offerings
require the purchase of resin, steel, aluminum and corrugate. The Company has experienced
inflation in these raw materials, especially in resin, and expects such inflation pressures to
continue in 2006. The Company has reduced the volume of its resin purchases through product line
rationalization and strategic divestitures. In 2005, the Company purchased approximately 900
million pounds of resin and expects to purchase approximately 10% less in 2006. See Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion.


Backlog

The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.

Seasonal Variations

The Company’s sales and operating income in the first quarter are generally lower than any other
quarter during the year, driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the
quarter. The Cleaning & Organization and Other business segments typically have higher sales in
the second half of the year due to retail stocking related to the holiday season; the Home Fashions
business segment typically has higher sales in the second and third quarters due to an increased
level of do-it-yourself projects completed in the summer months; the Tools & Hardware business
segment typically has higher sales in the third and fourth quarters due to an increased level of
home improvement projects completed in the summer and fall months and purchases of tools as gifts
for the holiday season; and the Office Products business segment has higher sales in the second and
third quarters due to the back-to-school season.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company has many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are, in the aggregate,
important to its business. The Company’s most significant registered trademarks are “Rubbermaid

“Sharpie

Customers / Competition

The Company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home
centers, warehouse clubs and office superstores, and commercial distributors. The rapid growth of
these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have
contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and the
formation of dominant multi-category retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers.
This environment limits the Company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices.

Current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers,
demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and
deliver products with shorter lead times. Other trends, in the absence of a strong new product
development effort or strong end-user brands, are for the retailer to import generic products
directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products, under their own private label
brands, that compete with products of the Company. The combination of these market influences has
created an intensely competitive environment in which the Company’s principal customers
continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in pricing pressures and the need
for strong end-user brands, the ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing
improvements in customer service. The Company competes with numerous manufacturers and
distributors of consumer products, many of which are large and well established.

The Company has positioned itself to respond to the challenges of this retail environment by
developing strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company markets its strong
multi-product offering through virtually every category of high-volume retailer, including
discount, drug, grocery and variety chains, warehouse clubs, department, hardware and specialty
stores, home centers, office superstores, contract stationers and military exchanges. The
Company’s largest customer, Wal*Mart (which includes Sam’s Club), accounted for approximately 14%
of net sales in 2005, across substantially all divisions. The Company’s top ten customers included
(

in alphabetical order

): Ace Hardware, Lowe’s, Office Depot, Office Max, Staples, Target, The Home
Depot, Toys ‘R’ Us, United Stationers and Wal*Mart.

The Company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are high brand name
recognition, superior customer service (including innovative “good-better-best” marketing and
merchandising programs), consistent on-time delivery, decentralized manufacturing and marketing,
centralized administration, outsourcing certain production to low cost suppliers and lower cost
countries where appropriate and experienced management.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The factors that are discussed below, as well as the matters that are generally set forth in this
report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could materially and
adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company is subject to risks related to its dependence on the strength of retail economies in
various parts of the world.

The Company’s business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the
world, primarily in North America and to a lesser extent Europe, Central and South America and
Asia. These retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the
condition of the retail industry, which, in turn, are affected by general economic conditions and
specific events such as natural disasters and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In
recent years, the retail industry in the U.S. and, increasingly, elsewhere has been characterized
by intense competition and consolidation among retailers. Because such competition, particularly
in weak retail economies, can cause retailers to struggle or fail, the Company must continuously
monitor, and adapt to changes in, the profitability, creditworthiness and pricing policies of its
customers.

The Company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers.

The Company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial
products, many of which are large and well established. The Company’s principal customers are
large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs and office
superstores, and commercial distributors. The rapid growth of these large mass merchandisers,
together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to the formation of dominant
multi-category retailers that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Current trends among
retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding innovative new
products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with
shorter lead times. Other trends are for retailers to import products directly from foreign
sources and to source and sell products, under their own private label brands, that compete with
products of the Company.

The combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in
which the Company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use,
resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for strong end-user brands, the ongoing
introduction of innovative new products, continuing improvements in customer service, and the
maintenance of strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company also faces the
risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major retailer customers, such as overall store
and inventory reductions and retailer consolidation. The resulting risks to the Company include
possible loss of sales, reduced profitability and limited ability to recover cost increases through
price increases.

To compete successfully, the Company must develop a continuing stream of innovative new products
that create consumer demand.


The Company’s long-term success in this competitive retail environment depends on its ability to
develop a continuing stream of innovative new products that create consumer demand for the
Company’s products. The Company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative
new products that compete with the Company’s products. Project Acceleration, a three-year
initiative announced in September 2005, includes increased investment in new product development.
There are, nevertheless, numerous uncertainties inherent in successfully developing and introducing
innovative new products on a continuing basis, and new product launches may not deliver expected
growth results.

To compete successfully, the Company must develop and maintain strong end-user brands.

The Company’s competitive success also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain
strong end-user brands so that the Company’s retailer customers will need the Company’s products to
meet consumer demand. The development and maintenance of such brands requires significant
investment in brand building and marketing initiatives. While the Company is substantially
increasing its expenditures for advertising and other brand building and marketing initiatives as a
part of Project Acceleration, the increased investment may not deliver the anticipated results.

Price increases in raw materials could harm the Company’s financial results.

The Company purchases some raw materials, including resin, corrugate, steel and aluminum, that are
subject to price volatility and inflationary pressure. The Company attempts to reduce its exposure
to increases in those costs through a variety of programs, including periodic purchases, purchases
for future delivery, long-term contracts and sales price adjustments. Where practical, the Company
uses derivatives as part of its risk management process. Raw material price increases may offset
productivity gains and could materially impact the Company’s financial results.

The Company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve productivity and streamline
operations, principally by reducing its manufacturing overhead.

The Company’s objective is to become its retailer customers’ low-cost provider and global supplier
and brand of choice. To do this, the Company needs to continuously improve its manufacturing
efficiencies and develop sources of supply on a global basis. Project Acceleration includes the
closure of approximately one-third of the Company’s 80 manufacturing facilities (as of September
2005) over the next three years. The Company also needs to continue to divest low-margin product
lines that do not fit in the Company’s strategic plan. The Company runs the risk that Project
Acceleration may not be completed substantially as planned, may be more costly to implement than
expected, or may not have the positive effects anticipated, or that another major productivity and
streamlining program may be required after Project Acceleration is completed. In addition,
disruptions in the Company’s ability to supply products on a timely basis, which may be incidental
to any problems in the execution of Project Acceleration, could adversely affect the Company’s
future results.

The Company needs to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired
businesses.

Although the Company has in recent years increasingly emphasized internal growth rather than growth
by acquisition, the Company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate
the acquired businesses successfully, obtaining anticipated cost savings and operating income
improvements within a reasonable period of time, remain important factors in the Company’s future
growth. For example, the successful integration of the recently acquired DYMO business into the
Company’s Office Products segment is important to the Company’s success. Furthermore, the cost of
any future major acquisitions could constrain the Company’s access to capital and increase the
Company’s borrowing costs.

The Company is subject to risks related to its international operations.

Foreign operations, especially in Europe, but also in Asia, Central and South America and Canada,
are important to the Company’s business. In November 2005, the Company acquired the DYMO business
and thereby increased the magnitude of the Company’s operations in Europe. In addition, as the
Company increasingly sources products in low-cost countries, particularly in the Far East, it is
exposed to additional risks and uncertainties. Foreign operations can be affected by factors such
as currency devaluation, other currency fluctuations, tariffs, nationalization,


exchange controls, interest rates, limitations on foreign investment in local business and other
political, economic and regulatory risks and difficulties. The Company also faces risks due to the
transportation and logistical complexities inherent in increased reliance on foreign sourcing.

The Company faces challenges and uncertainties as it transforms into a company that grows through
strong brands and new product innovation.

The Company is undergoing a transformation from a portfolio-holding company that grew through
acquisitions to a focused group of leadership platforms that generate internal growth driven by
strong brands and new product innovation. Although the process is well underway, there remain
significant challenges and uncertainties.

Impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.

Future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the Company’s assets and
require impairment charges. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions
made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic
environment on the Company’s customer base, or a material adverse change in its relationship with
significant customers.

Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect the Company’s financial
results or harm its reputation or the value of its end-user brands.

Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of the Company’s products arise in the
ordinary course of the Company’s business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary
judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that
could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplace or the value of its end-user brands. The
Company could also be required to recall possibly defective products, which could result in adverse
publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance
coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a self-insured retention or could be
excluded under the terms of the policy.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to
an assessment and understanding of the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial
condition. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Executive Overview

Newell Rubbermaid is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer products and their
commercial extensions, serving a wide array of retail channels including department stores,
discount stores, warehouse clubs, home centers, hardware stores, commercial distributors, office
superstores, contract stationers, automotive stores and

- 18 -

baby superstores. The Company’s basic business strategy is to create brands that matter by
marketing a multi-product offering of consumer and commercial products, backed by a focus on
innovation and customer service excellence, in order to achieve maximum results for its
stockholders. The Company conducts businesses in five operating segments as follows:

Segment

Description of Products

Cleaning & Organization

Material handling, cleaning, refuse, indoor/outdoor organization, home storage, food storage

Office Products

Ballpoint/roller ball pens, markers, highlighters, pencils, correction fluids, office products, art supplies, on-demand labeling products

Tools & Hardware

Hand tools, power tool accessories, manual paint applicators, cabinet, window and convenience hardware, propane torches, solder

Home Fashions

Drapery hardware, window treatments

Other

Operating segments that do not meet aggregation criteria, including aluminum and stainless steel cookware, hair care accessory products, infant and juvenile products, including toys, high chairs, car seats, strollers and play yards

The Company remains committed to investing in strategic brands and new product development, having
best cost platforms, and strengthening its portfolio of businesses. The Company will continue to
make investments in advertising, promotion, and new product development in its “invest” businesses,
which encompass the Company’s high-potential, high margin brands, while taking action to improve
profitability in its “fix” businesses, which encompass many of the Company’s low margin product
lines.

The Company defines invest businesses as those having high margin opportunity and the ability to
generate profitable growth through innovative new products and investments in brand building and
marketing. Invest businesses are generally meeting or exceeding the company’s minimum financial
targets and collectively generate above average operating income margins. Fix businesses are
characterized as having unacceptable profitability levels. Management’s primary focus for fix
businesses is to take significant actions to improve overall profitability. For all periods
presented, the Company classified Rubbermaid Home Products, Home Fashions, Goody, Graco and Little
Tikes as fix businesses. Beginning in 2006, Graco and Goody will be classified as invest
businesses.

The following section details the Company’s performance in each of its 2005 objectives:

Strengthen/Broaden its Portfolio of Businesses

The Company continues to evaluate its current portfolio and intends to pursue acquisition
opportunities to complement internal growth. In addition to acquiring high potential businesses or
product lines, such as DYMO, the Company is focused on divesting non-strategic businesses, such as
the divested Curver and the European Cookware businesses, and rationalizing low margin product
lines that do not fit within the Company’s strategy. In 2005 and 2004, the Company rationalized
$200 million and $257 million, respectively, in low-margin product sales. See Footnote 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on acquisitions. See Footnote
3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on divestitures.

Invest in High Margin Businesses

The Company continues to focus significant resources on enhancing its new product development
pipeline, as well as strengthening the Company’s numerous brands through targeted advertising and
promotion. In 2005, the Company made additional investments in SG&A (primarily in the Office
Products and Tools & Hardware segments) through increased expenditures for advertising and
promotion.

In order to partially fund increases in SG&A in the invest businesses, the Company is focused on
streamlining its operations to reduce non-strategic costs throughout the organization.

Address Raw Material Inflation

The Company has several businesses that have been significantly impacted by raw material inflation,
particularly in resin and to a lesser extent, steel. The Company historically combated such cost
increases through internal

- 19 -

productivity initiatives. However, due to the continued inflationary
pressure in raw materials, the Company has implemented sales price increases to offset a portion of
the increased costs. In 2005, the Company experienced raw material inflation of approximately
$153 million (primarily in resin and steel), partially offset by pricing increases of
approximately $132 million. The Company expects such inflationary pressures to continue in
2006. The Company has reduced the volume of its resin purchases through product line
rationalization and divestitures in 2005. In 2005, the Company purchased approximately 900 million
pounds of resin and expects to purchase approximately 10% less in 2006.

Reduce Manufacturing Overhead

The Company is committed to reducing the cost of manufacturing. The primary focus is on reducing
its manufacturing overhead structure and labor costs.

In 2005, the Company announced a global initiative referred to as Project Acceleration aimed at
strengthening and transforming the Company’s portfolio. In connection with Project Acceleration,
in September 2005 the Board of Directors of the Company approved a three-year restructuring plan
(“the Plan”), which commenced in December 2005. While the Board of Directors has approved the
overall plan, specific approval of each individual project is required prior to commencing the
action in accordance with the Company’s schedule of corporate authority. The Plan is designed to
reduce manufacturing overhead by strategically sourcing and manufacturing products in lower cost
countries. The Company began executing the Plan in the fourth quarter of 2005 and recorded
$51.3 million in non-cash restructuring charges. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on restructuring.

The Plan is expected to result in cumulative restructuring charges totaling between $350
million and $400 million ($295 million — $340 million after tax), with between
$170 million and $200 million ($145 million — $170 million after tax) to be
incurred in 2006. Approximately 60% of the cumulative charges under Project Acceleration are
expected to be cash charges. The Company expects annual savings from the plan to exceed $120
million upon conclusion of the program. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.

Additionally, the Company is committed to the deployment of Newell Operational Excellence. Newell
Operational Excellence is the process that the Company has developed using best practices from
methodologies such as Six Sigma, Kaizen, Kanban and other lean manufacturing principles. The
Company delivered approximately $87 million of productivity savings, excluding raw material
inflation, during 2005.

2006 Priorities:

In 2006, management is focused on the following key objectives:

1.

Invest in Strategic Brands to Deliver Top-Line Growth:

The Company’s emphasis will be to
deliver sales growth through increased investments in marketing and new product development on
the strongest brands within its invest businesses. The Company will focus on developing
best-in-class practices for innovation and branding. The Company’s objective is to build
brands that really matter to its consumers. The Company will put in the systems to understand
its consumers in detail — how they use its products, what they value, and how to delight them
or excite them. The Company will invest in more innovation that differentiates its products.
The Company will have to invest more in advertising and other consumer marketing to increase
awareness as well as trial and repeat purchases. Further, the Company will have to be able to
measure the effectiveness of those increased marketing investments.

2.

Reduce Supply Chain Costs/Execute Project Acceleration:

Through Newell Operational
Excellence and previous restructuring, the Company has made significant progress in reducing
its supply chain costs and delivering productivity savings. The Company will broaden the
supply chain efforts to include purchasing and distribution & transportation. Project
Acceleration is designed to reduce manufacturing overhead and labor costs by strategically
sourcing and manufacturing products in lower cost countries.

3.

Strengthen the Portfolio:

The Company has made significant progress in strengthening its
portfolio over the past three years. The Company has made selective acquisitions of new
product lines. In 2005, the Company

- 20 -

acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing,
manufacturing and marketing on-demand labeling solutions, and plans to integrate DYMO into its
Office Products segment in 2006. This acquisition will strengthen the Company’s global
leadership position in the Office Products segment by expanding and enhancing the Company’s
product lines and customer base. In 2003, the Company acquired LENOX, a leading manufacturer
of power tools accessories and hand tools. The Company also divests businesses that do not
fit its business model (i.e., businesses that can sustain high margins and grow through
investments in brands and new product innovation). In 2004, the Company sold its U.S. picture
frame business (Burnes), its Anchor Hocking glassware business, its Mirro cookware business,
its Panex Brazilian low-end cookware business, its European picture frames business and its
Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems business. In 2005, the Company sold its Curver
business and entered into an agreement to sell its European Cookware business, completing this
sale in January 2006. The Company will continue to review opportunities to optimize the
portfolio through selective acquisitions and divestitures.

4.

Streamline Non-Strategic SG&A:

In 2006, the Company will continue to streamline its
non-strategic SG&A, especially in its fix businesses, by challenging non-strategic costs and
SG&A investments in these businesses. The Company plans to use those savings to fund
investments in SG&A in its invest businesses, primarily through increased advertising, new
product development, promotion and brand building activities.

Net sales in the Company’s invest businesses improved 2.0% for 2005 versus 2004, led by double
digit growth in the LENOX tools businesses and high single digit growth in Rubbermaid Commercial
Products and IRWIN- branded tools businesses. The acquisition of DYMO contributed $24.9
million in net sales in 2005.

Net sales in the Company’s fix businesses declined 8.0% for 2005 versus 2004, as a result of low
margin product line exits in Rubbermaid Home Products and core sales declines in the Little Tikes
battery operated products and European Window Fashion businesses.

Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2005 was 29.9%, or $1,894.4 million, versus
28.4%, or $1,838.8 million, for 2004. The improvement in gross margin is primarily related to
favorable pricing of $132 million, or 2.0% of net sales, gross productivity of $87
million, and favorable mix driven by the rationalization of unprofitable product lines primarily in
the Rubbermaid Home Products business, partially offset by raw material inflation of $153
million (primarily resin and steel) and the impact of the core sales decline.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for 2005 were 20.0% of net sales, or
$1,265.6 million, versus 18.7%, or $1,208.8 million, for 2004. The increase in SG&A
reflects a currency impact of $11.0 million, a $9.0 million impact from the acquisition
of DYMO and strategic investments in invest businesses, partially offset by streamlining in the
Company’s fix businesses.

The Company recorded non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of $34.4 million and $295.1
million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 charges were required to write-down certain
assets to fair value, including goodwill, trademarks and tradenames related to the Company’s United
Kingdom Home Fashions business. The 2004 charges were required to write-down certain assets to
fair value, primarily in the Company’s European and Latin American Office Products businesses. See
Footnote 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The Company recorded restructuring costs of $72.2 million and $44.2 million for 2005 and
2004, respectively. The 2005 restructuring costs included $51.3 million in non-cash facility
restructuring charges relating to Project Acceleration and $20.9 million relating to
restructuring actions approved prior to the commencement of Project Acceleration. The $20.9
million of pre-Project Acceleration costs included $7.7 million of facility and other exit
costs, $11.4 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $1.8 million of
exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The 2004 costs included $39.6
million of facility and other exit costs, $3.0 million of employee severance and termination
benefits and $1.6 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs.
See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the
restructuring costs.

Operating income for 2005 was $522.2 million, or 8.2% of net sales, versus $290.7
million, or 4.5% of net sales, in 2004. The improvement in operating margins is the result of the
factors described above.

Net nonoperating expenses for 2005 were 1.6% of net sales, or $104.1 million, versus 1.8% of
net sales, or $116.1 million, for 2004. The decrease in net nonoperating expenses is mainly
attributable to gains recognized in 2005 on the sale of property, plant and equipment and the
liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. This was partially offset by an increase in net interest
expense, $127.1 million for 2005 compared to $119.3 million for 2004. The increase in
net interest expense was primarily due to higher borrowing rates, partially offset by lower average
debt balances. See Footnote 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The effective tax rate was 14.8% for 2005 versus 59.6% for 2004. The change in the effective tax
rate is primarily related to the $73.9 million income tax benefit recorded in 2005 compared to
the net income tax benefit of $15.5 million recorded in 2004, as a result of favorable
resolution of certain tax positions and the expiration of the statute of limitations on other
deductions. Additionally, the effective tax rate was impacted by the non-deductibility associated
with a portion of the Company’s impairment charges recorded in 2005 and 2004 ($34.4 million
and $295.1 million, respectively). See Footnotes 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

In the second quarter of 2005, the Company committed to the disposal of a business in the Cleaning
& Organization segment and recognized impairment charge of $24.5 million, net of tax, in order
to state the assets of this
business at their estimated fair values. In the third and fourth quarters of 2005, the Company
revised its estimation related to the fair value of this business after winning several line
reviews with a key retailer and reversed the full amount of the impairment charge. In the fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company changed its decision to dispose of this business

- 22 -

as a result of the
aforementioned line review wins and the identification of significant productivity opportunities.
The results of this business are reflected in continuing operations.

Income from continuing operations for 2005 was $356.4 million, compared to $70.6 million
for 2004. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.30 for 2005 compared
to $0.26 for 2004.

The loss from discontinued operations for 2005 was $105.1 million, compared to $186.7
million for 2004. For 2005, the loss on disposal of discontinued operations was $96.8
million, comprised primarily of a $62.0 million loss on the disposal of the Curver business
and a $33.9 million loss related to the sale of the European Cookware business. For 2004,
the Company recorded a $21.5 million loss on the disposal of the U.S. picture frames business
(Burnes), the Anchor Hocking glassware business, and the Mirro cookware business, a $72.2
million loss on the disposal of the Panex Brazilian low-end cookware division, and a $6.4
million loss, net of tax, on the disposal of the European picture frames business, partially offset
by a gain on the disposal of the Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems business of $9.6
million. Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations was $0.38 for 2005 compared to
$0.68 for 2004. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

Net income (loss) for 2005 was $251.3 million, compared to ($116.1) million for 2004.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share was $0.91 for 2005 compared to ($0.42) for 2004.

Results of Operations — 2004 vs. 2003

Net sales for 2004 were $6,479.8 million, representing a decrease of $135.0 million, or

Net sales in the Company’s invest businesses improved 1.0% in 2004 versus 2003 led by single digit
growth in Tools & Hardware and Rubbermaid Commercial Products.

Net sales in the Company’s fix businesses declined 6.0% in 2004 versus 2003, as a result of planned
rationalization of low margin products in the Rubbermaid Home Products and Graco Children’s
Products businesses.

Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2004 was 28.4%, or $1,838.8 million, versus
28.5%, or $1,882.1 million, for 2003. The decline in gross margin is primarily related to raw
material inflation of $116 million and unfavorable pricing of $3 million, partially
offset by favorable mix driven by the rationalization of unprofitable product lines, primarily in
the Rubbermaid Home Products business, gross productivity and other savings of $76 million.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for 2004 were 18.7% of net sales, or
$1,208.8 million, versus 17.5%, or $1,160.7 million, for 2003. The increase in SG&A
reflects a currency impact of $37 million and pension cost increases of $16 million. All
other SG&A was down $5 million, with strategic investments more than offset by streamlining in
the Company’s fix businesses.

The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $295.1 million and $34.5 million for
2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2004 charge was required to write-down certain assets to fair
value, primarily in the Company’s European and Latin American Office Products businesses. The 2003
charge was required to write-down certain assets to fair value, primarily in the Company’s Cleaning
& Organization segment, resulting from the
decision to exit certain product lines. See Footnote 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information.

The Company recorded restructuring costs of $44.2 million and $189.3 million for 2004 and
2003, respectively. The 2004 costs included $39.6 million of facility and other exit costs,
$3.0 million of employee severance and termination benefits and $1.6 million of exited
contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. The 2003 pre-tax costs included $83.2
million of facility and other exit costs, $80.2 million of employee severance and

- 23 -

termination benefits and $25.9 million of exited contractual commitments and other
restructuring costs. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information on the restructuring costs.

Operating income for 2004 was $290.7 million, or 4.5% of net sales, versus $497.6 million, or 7.5%
of net sales, in 2003. The decline in operating margins is the result of the factors described
above.

Net nonoperating expenses for 2004 were 1.8% of net sales, or $116.1 million, versus 2.4% of net
sales, or $159.9 million, for 2003. The decrease in net nonoperating expenses is attributable to
a reduction in net interest expense of $15.0 million in 2004
($119.3 million in 2004 compared to $134.3 million in 2003), as a
result of lower average debt outstanding, partially offset by increased interest rates. Also, in
2003, the Company recognized a $30.4 million non-cash loss on the sale of its Cosmolab and Photo
Fashions businesses. See Footnote 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

The effective tax rate was 59.6% for 2004 versus 35.5% for 2003. The change in the effective tax
rate is primarily related to the non-deductibility associated with a portion of the Company’s
$295.1 million impairment charge in 2004, partially offset by the net income tax benefit of $15.5
million recorded in 2004, as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax positions and the
expiration of the statute of limitations. See Footnotes 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

Income from continuing operations for 2004 was $70.6 million, compared to $217.9 million for 2003.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.26 for 2004 compared to $0.79 for
2003.

The loss from discontinued operations in 2004 was $186.7 million compared to $264.5 million in
2003. The loss from operations of discontinued operations for 2004 was $96.2 million, compared to
$264.5 million for 2003. For 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax write-down of $254.9
million on certain businesses that it was evaluating for potential sale and were presented in
discontinued operations. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information. The loss on disposal of discontinued operations for 2004
was $90.5 million. In 2003,
there were no disposals of business. In 2004, the Company recorded a $21.5 million loss on the
disposal of the U.S. picture frames business (Burnes), Anchor Hocking glassware business, and Mirro
cookware business, a $72.2 million loss on the disposal of the Panex Brazilian low-end cookware
division, a $6.4 million loss on the disposal of the European picture frames business, partially
offset by a gain on the disposal of the Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems business of $9.6
million. Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations was $0.68 for 2004 compared to $0.96
for 2003. See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Net loss for 2004 was $116.1 million, compared to $46.6 million for 2004. Diluted loss per share
was $0.42 for 2004 compared to $0.17 for 2003.

Cleaning & Organization

Net sales for 2005 were $1,614.6 million, a decrease of $88.1 million, or 5.2%, from $1,702.7
million in 2004, driven primarily by the planned product line exits and core sales declines in the
Rubbermaid Home Products business. These factors were partially offset by increases in core
product sales in the Rubbermaid Commercial Products business, favorable pricing and foreign
currency translation.

Operating income for 2005 was $116.9 million, an increase of $16.2 million, or 16.1%, from $100.7
million in 2004. The improvement in operating income is the result of core sales growth in
Rubbermaid Commercial Products, favorable sales mix and favorable pricing which more than offset
raw material inflation and lost absorption in manufacturing facilities.

Office Products

Net sales for 2005 were $1,713.3 million, an increase of $27.1 million, or 1.6% from $1,686.2
million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of DYMO, the introduction of
innovative new products in the markers business and favorable foreign currency translation,
partially offset by sales declines in the fine writing and the Eldon office products businesses.

Operating income for 2005 was $266.0 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 1.6%, from $261.9
million in 2004, as a result of the impact of the DYMO acquisition and improved margins associated
with the new product introductions and productivity, partially offset by raw material inflation and
increased investment in SG&A, primarily related to advertising and promotion.

Tools & Hardware

Net sales for 2005 were $1,260.3 million, an increase of $41.6 million, or 3.4%, from $1,218.7
million in 2004, driven by increases in the LENOX, and IRWIN-branded businesses, partially offset
by sales declines in the Amerock business and consumer electronic tools.

Operating income for 2005 was $171.1 million, a decrease of $10.7 million, or 5.9%, from $181.8
million in 2004, driven by raw material inflation, restructuring related costs at the Amerock
business and investments in SG&A in the tools business, partially offset by productivity and the
sales increase noted above.

Home Fashions

Net sales for 2005 were $824.0 million, a decrease of $82.8 million, or 9.1%, from $906.8 million
in 2004, driven by product line exits and core sales declines in the European Home Fashions
business, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and increased sales in the
North American Home Fashions business.

Operating income for 2005 was $22.7 million, a decrease of $10.3 million, or 31.2%, from $33.0
million in 2004. The decrease in operating income was due primarily to lower sales, partially
offset by productivity.

Other

Net sales for 2005 were $930.3 million, a decrease of $35.1 million, or 3.6%, from $965.4 million
in 2004. The decline is primarily the result of core sales declines in the Little Tikes battery
operated products business.


Operating income for 2005 was $98.1 million, an increase of $6.1 million, or 6.6%, from $92.0
million in the comparable period of 2004, driven by productivity, favorable pricing and reduced
SG&A in the juvenile products businesses, partially offset by raw material inflation.

Net sales for 2004 were $1,702.7 million, a decrease of $145.9 million, or 7.9%, from $1,848.6
million in 2003. The 7.9% sales decrease was driven primarily by a decline in the Rubbermaid Home
Products business due to planned low-margin product line rationalizations, partially offset by
favorable pricing and increases in core product sales in the Rubbermaid Foodservice, Rubbermaid
Commercial, and Rubbermaid Asia Pacific businesses.

Operating income for 2004 was $100.7 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 2.8%, from $103.6
million in 2003. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of higher raw material
costs (particularly resin), partially offset by favorable pricing and improvement in Rubbermaid
Commercial and Rubbermaid Asia Pacific businesses.

Office Products

Net sales for 2004 were $1,686.2 million, an increase of $5.0 million, or 0.3%, from $1,681.2
million in 2003. The increase in net sales primarily resulted from a single-digit increase in the
writing instruments business on the strength of innovative new products, largely offset by the exit
of low margin resin based products in the Eldon office products business.

Operating income for 2004 was $261.9 million, a decrease of $47.7 million, or 15.4%, from $309.6
million in 2003. The decrease in operating income was driven by restructuring related costs in the
European writing instruments business and raw material inflation, primarily in resin costs in the
Eldon office products division, partially offset by improvement in the Sanford Latin America and
Sanford Asia Pacific businesses.

Tools & Hardware


Net sales for 2004 were $1,218.7 million, an increase of $19.0 million, or 1.6%, from $1,199.7
million in 2003. The increase in net sales was driven by increases in the LENOX businesses.

Operating income for 2004 was $181.8 million, an increase of $2.5 million, or 1.4%, from $179.3
million in 2003. The improvement in operating income was generated primarily by productivity
savings, sales increases and streamlining initiatives, partially offset by raw material inflation.

Home Fashions

Net sales for 2004 were $906.8 million, an increase of $5.8 million, or 0.6%, from $901.0 million
in 2003. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by favorable foreign currency fluctuation,
partially offset by planned product line exits in the Swish UK business.

Operating income for 2004 was $33.0 million, a decrease of $11.4 million, or 25.7%, from $44.4
million in 2003. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of raw material
inflation and charges related to the liquidation of certain product lines in the segment.

Other

Net sales for 2004 were $965.4 million, a decrease of $18.9 million, or 1.9%, from $984.3 million
in 2003. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the sale of Cosmolab in March
2003, which contributed $10 million in sales in 2003, and sales declines experienced in the Graco
business.

Operating income for 2004 was $92.0 million, a decrease of $22.8 million, or 19.9%, from $114.8
million in 2003. The decrease in operating income was due primarily to the sales decrease at Graco
and raw material inflation in resin based products.

Sources

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources include cash provided by
operations, proceeds from divestitures and use of available borrowing facilities.

Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $641.6 million
compared to $660.0 million for the comparable period of 2004. Net cash provided by operating
activities before working capital changes decreased in 2005, which was partially offset by
improvements in working capital.

In 2005, the Company received cash proceeds of $65.5 million related to the sale of businesses and
other non-current assets, compared to $318.1 million in 2004. In 2005, the Company received cash
proceeds of $64.3 million related to the sale of other non-current assets, compared to $55.3
million in 2004. In 2005, the Company sold the Curver business. Businesses sold in 2004 include
Panex Brazilian low-end cookware, European picture frames, U.S. picture frames (Burnes), Anchor
Hocking glassware, Mirro cookware and Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems.


In 2005, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $337.0 million compared to
$33.9 million in 2004. Most of the increase in 2005 was due to the issuance of commercial paper
related to the funding of the November 2005 DYMO acquisition.

The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that
are available for short-term financing. Borrowings under the Company’s uncommitted lines of credit
are subject to the discretion of the lender. The Company’s lines of credit do not have a material
impact on the Company’s liquidity. Borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit at December 31,
2005 and 2004 totaled $4.0 million and $21.3 million, respectively.

In November 2005, the Company entered into a $750.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility
(the “Revolver”) pursuant to a five-year credit agreement. The Revolver, which expires in November
2010, replaces the Company’s $650.0 million five-year Syndicated Revolving Credit Agreement that
was scheduled to expire in June 2007. At December 31, 2005, there were no borrowings under the
Revolver.

In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $750.0 million of commercial
paper. The Revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper.
Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the
Revolver. The Revolver also provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of standby letters
of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. At
December 31, 2005, $202.0 million of commercial paper was outstanding and there were no standby
letters of credit issued under the Revolver.

The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms and requires,
among other things, that the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness to
Total Capital Ratio, as defined in the agreement. The Revolver also limits Subsidiary
Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with the agreement governing
the Revolver. On an annual basis, the Company may request extension of the Revolver (subject to
lender approval) for additional one-year periods.

Under a 2001 receivables facility with a financial institution, the Company created a financing
entity that is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. Under this facility, the
Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an undivided interest
in substantially all of the Company’s United States trade receivables to the financing entity. In
2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt securities to the financial
institution. Certain levels of accounts receivable write-offs and other events would permit the
financial institution to terminate the receivables facility and require redemption of the preferred
debt securities. The receivables and preferred debt securities are recorded in the consolidated
accounts of the Company. The financing entity may cause the preferred debt securities to be
exchanged on September 18, 2006 for a two year floating rate note in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the par value of the preferred debt securities plus accrued but unpaid return. Upon the
exchange, the financing entity will pay to the preferred debt securities holder, a premium for
which the Company has accrued $4.6 million as of December 31, 2005. Because this debt matures in
2008, the entire amount is considered to be long-term debt. At any time prior to maturity of the
note, the holder may elect to convert it into new preferred debt securities of the financing
company with a par value equal to the outstanding principal amount of the note. The preferred debt
securities must be retired or redeemed, and any note for which such securities are exchanged must
be repaid, before the Company can have access to the financing entity’s receivables. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables sold under this
facility was $746.9 million and $720.9 million, respectively.

Uses

The Company’s primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include acquisitions, dividend
payments, capital expenditures and payments on debt.

Cash used for acquisitions was $740.0 million in 2005, compared to $6.6 million in 2004. The cash
used in 2005 related primarily to the acquisition of DYMO for $706 million, which was funded by
approximately $487 million of cash on hand and $219 million from existing credit facilities. See
Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2004, the
Company did not invest in significant acquisitions.


Capital expenditures were $92.2 million and $121.9 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the Company’s focus on capital spending
discipline in 2005. Capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to be in the range of $125 to $150
million.

In 2005, the Company made payments on notes payable and long-term debt of $360.1 million compared
to $298.4 million in 2004, including the purchases in 2005 of 750,000 shares of its 5.25%
convertible preferred securities from holders at an average price of $47.075 per share ($35.3
million). In 2004, the Company purchased 825,000 shares of its 5.25% convertible preferred
securities from a holder for $43.6875 per share ($36.0 million). See Footnote 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions.

Aggregate dividends paid were $231.5 million and $231.0 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In
2006, the Company expects to make similar dividend payments.

Cash used for restructuring activities was $35.5 million and $79.7 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. These payments relate primarily to employee termination benefits. In 2006, the
Company expects to use approximately $100 million of cash on restructuring activities related to
Project Acceleration. See Footnote 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

In 2005, the Company made a voluntary $25.0 million cash contribution to fund its foreign pension
plans. In 2004, the Company made a voluntary $50.0 million cash contribution to fund the Company’s
U.S. pension plan.

In 2005, the Company terminated a cross currency interest rate swap and paid $26.9 million. This
payment has been recognized in operating cash flow. In 2004, the Company recognized $5.5 million
related to the fair value of an interest rate swap that was terminated as a source in operating
cash flow.

Retained earnings increased in 2005 by $19.7 million. The increase in retained earnings is due to
the current year net income, partially offset by cash dividends paid on common stock.

Working capital at December 31, 2005 was $675.3 million compared to $1,141.1 million at December
31, 2004. The current ratio at December 31, 2005 was 1.38:1 compared to 1.61:1 at December 31,
2004. The decrease in working capital is due to cash used to fund the DYMO acquisition, partially
offset by favorable tax settlements and the reduction of other accrued liabilities, primarily as a
result of spending on previously announced restructuring plans.

Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash equivalents, and total
capitalization includes total debt and stockholders’ equity) was .60:1 at December 31, 2005 and .55:1 at December 31, 2004.

The Company believes that cash provided from operations and available borrowing facilities will
continue to provide adequate support for the cash needs of existing businesses on a short-term
basis; however, certain events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional external
financing on a long-term basis.

Minimum Pension Liability

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment at
December 31, 2005. The effect of this non-cash adjustment was to increase the pension liability by
approximately $89.1 million, with a corresponding charge to equity, net of taxes, of approximately
$60 million. The Company believes that its pension plan has the appropriate long-term investment
strategy and the Company’s liquidity position is expected to remain strong.

Resolution of Income Tax Contingencies

In 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $73.9 million and $15.5 million, respectively, in income tax
benefit as a result of favorable resolution of certain tax issues and the expiration of the statute
of limitations on certain tax issues. These benefits are reflected in the Company’s 2005 and 2004
Consolidated Statements of Operations.


Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in its
consolidated financial statements. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other
executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in
the Company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or
inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2005 and future minimum lease payments
for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements.

The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations
listed below are expected to have on the Company’s cash flow in the indicated period. In addition,
the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of
December 31, 2005. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the footnotes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, as referenced in the table

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $96.7 million in standby letters of credit primarily
related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product
liability, and medical. See Footnote 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements,
as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. As disclosed in Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects
cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires
the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such
differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections
describe the Company’s critical accounting policies.


Sales Recognition

Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all
substantial risks of ownership change, which occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based
upon contractual terms. Sales is net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts
(such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts.

Recovery of Accounts Receivable

The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
When aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the
case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial
position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to
the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for
bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the
receivables are past due and historical collection experience. If circumstances related to
specific customers change, the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be
further adjusted. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had allowances for doubtful accounts of
$31.8 million on $1,234.5 million of accounts receivable.

Inventory Reserves

The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an
amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based
upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite life intangible
assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its annual strategic planning process for all
of its businesses. The Company also tests for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite life
intangible asset is below its carrying amount.

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the
reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not
limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact
of the economic environment on the Company’s customer base, or a material negative change in its
relationships with significant customers.

The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill and other indefinite
lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and tradenames) in its impairment tests, generally based
upon a discounted cash flow methodology, or an actual sales offer received from a prospective
buyer, if available. The discounted cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions
regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, terminal value, and market discount rates.
The underlying assumptions used are consistent with those used in the strategic plan.

If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value, goodwill impairment
may be present. The Company measures the goodwill impairment based upon the fair value of the
underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible
assets, and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to
the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.

If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is
recorded to the extent the recorded intangible asset exceeds the fair value.

Other Long-Lived Assets

The Company tests its other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” In accordance with


SFAS No. 144, the Company evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property, plant and
equipment and other long-lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a
significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant
adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or
in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history
of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with
the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the company
estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted
future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying
amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and
expenses, working capital, and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the
strategic plan. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash
flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a risk-free discount rate and records an
impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset
group. Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product-line level,
as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.

Product Liability Reserves

The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for
self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses
historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant
individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product
liability reserves. The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred
but not reported when determining the Company’s product liability reserve. The Company has product
liability reserves of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2005. While the Company believes that it
has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the
amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be material to the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Legal and Environmental Reserves

The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local and
foreign laws and regulations, as well as, contract and other disputes. The Company evaluates the
potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable
loss based largely on historical experience. The estimated losses take into account anticipated
costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts, including legal fees, where an
assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably
estimated. No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Company’s cost estimates
or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present
value purposes, except with respect to long-term operations and maintenance CERCLA matters which
are estimated at present value. The Company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated
with these matters as of December 31, 2005 ranged between $12.8 million and $23.8 million. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company had a reserve equal to $15.4 million for such environmental response
costs in the aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Income Tax Contingencies

The Company establishes a tax contingency reserve for certain tax exposures when it is not probable
that the Company’s tax position will be ultimately sustained. The Company eliminates a tax
contingency reserve balance when it becomes probable that the Company’s tax position will
ultimately be sustained, which generally occurs when the statute of limitations for a specific
exposure item has expired or when the Company has reached agreement with the taxing authorities on
the treatment of an item. The Company generally assesses its tax contingency reserves on a
quarterly basis. Management cannot determine with certainty the ultimate resolution of these tax
matters. Actual results may differ from the recorded amounts.

Pending Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

Stock Options


In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised) (“SFAS 123(R)”), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS 123(R)
requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values (i.e., pro forma disclosure is no
longer an alternative to financial statement recognition). The Statement supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and will
require adoption no later than January 1, 2006. The Company has adopted the provisions of the new
standard using the modified prospective method and using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
effective January 1, 2006. As a result of adoption, the Company expects to recognize approximately
$15 million to $20 million, pre-tax, in additional expense in 2006.

International Operations

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company’s non-U.S. businesses accounted
for approximately 28%, 29% and 28% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements). Changes in both U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are shown below for the years

forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. The statements relate to, and other
forward-looking statements that may be made by the Company may relate to, but are not limited to,
information or assumptions about the effects of Project Acceleration, sales (including pricing),
income/(loss), earnings per share, return on equity, return on invested capital, capital
expenditures, working capital, cash flow, dividends, capital structure, debt to capitalization
ratios, interest rates, internal growth rates, restructuring, impairment and other charges,
potential losses on divestitures, impact of changes in accounting standards, pending legal
proceedings and claims (including environmental matters), future economic performance, operating
income improvements, costs and cost savings (including raw material inflation, productivity and

growth. These statements generally are accompanied by words such as “intend,” “anticipate,”
“believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “plan,” “expect,” “will,” “should” or similar
statements. You should understand that forward-looking statements are not guarantees because there
are inherent difficulties in predicting future results. Actual results could differ materially
from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. The factors that are discussed
in Part I, Item 1A of this report, as well as the matters that are set forth generally in this
report and the documents incorporated by reference herein, could cause actual results to differ.
Some of these factors are described as criteria for success. Our failure to achieve, or limited
success in achieving, these objectives could result in actual results differing materially from
those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. In addition, there can be no
assurance that we have correctly identified and assessed all of the factors affecting the Company
or that the publicly available and other information we receive with respect to these factors is
complete or correct.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

The Company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates
and certain commodity prices. Pursuant to the Company’s policies, natural hedging techniques and
derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market
prices. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.


The Company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix
of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures
when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for qualifying hedges, the interest differential
of swaps is included in interest expense.

The Company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany
and third party commercial transaction exposures of one-year duration or less. The Company focuses
on natural hedging techniques of the following form: 1) offsetting or netting of like foreign
currency flows, 2) structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels of debt to
reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk, 3)
converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S. dollars or the relevant functional currency
and 4) avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency. In
addition, the Company utilizes forward contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and
intercompany transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial and
intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions.
Derivatives used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or
losses included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company purchases certain raw materials, including resin, corrugate, steel and aluminum, which
are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors. While future movements of raw
material costs are uncertain, a variety of programs, including periodic raw material purchases,
purchases of raw materials for future delivery, long-term contracts and price adjustments help the
Company mitigate this risk. Where practical, the Company uses derivatives to help manage the
volatility related to this risk. In 2005, the Company experienced raw material inflation of
approximately $153 million (primarily in resin and steel), partially offset by pricing increases of
approximately $132 million.

The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the Company could
incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the
value-at-risk estimation model. The value-at-risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and
interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It
estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a
variance/covariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures (specifically
excluding equity-method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table below have no
impact on results of operations or financial condition, but are shown as an illustration of the
impact of potential adverse changes in interest rates. The following table indicates the
calculated amounts for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004

(in millions, except
percentages):

The 95% confidence interval signifies the Company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would
not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the Company’s favor. The
value-at-risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse. Actual experience
has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly unlikely that
the Company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time. These amounts
should not be considered projections of future losses, because actual results may differ
significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets.


ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. is responsible for the accuracy and internal consistency
of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and footnotes contained in this annual
report.

The Company’s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Newell Rubbermaid Inc. operates under a system of internal
accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The internal accounting control system is evaluated for
effectiveness by management and is tested, monitored and revised as necessary. All internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making its assessment, the Company’s management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on the results of its evaluation, the
Company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have audited the financial statements
prepared by the management of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. and management’s assessment of internal
control over financial reporting. Their reports on these financial statements, and on management’s
assessment of internal control over financial reporting, are presented below.

NEWELL RUBBERMAID INC.

Atlanta, Georgia

February 10, 2006


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Newell Rubbermaid Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. at December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February 10, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Newell Rubbermaid Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Responsibility
for Financial Statements and Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that
Newell Rubbermaid Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Newell
Rubbermaid Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Newell Rubbermaid Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Newell Rubbermaid Inc. maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 of Newell Rubbermaid
Inc. and our report dated February 10, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

FOOTNOTE 1

Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the “Company”) is a global manufacturer and
marketer of branded consumer products and their commercial extensions, serving a wide array of
retail channels including department stores, discount stores, warehouse clubs, home centers,
hardware stores, commercial distributors, office superstores, contract stationers, automotive
stores, and baby superstores. The Company’s basic business strategy is to create brands that
matter by marketing a multi-product offering of everyday consumer and commercial products, backed
by a focus on innovation and customer service excellence, in order to achieve maximum results for
its stockholders. The Company’s multi-product offering consists of well known name-brand consumer
products and their commercial extensions in five business segments: Cleaning & Organization;
Office Products; Tools & Hardware; Home Fashions; and Other.

Principles of Consolidation:

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the
Company, its majority owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities where the Company is the
primary beneficiary, after elimination of intercompany transactions.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of certain
estimates by management in determining the Company’s assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and
related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain 2004 and 2003 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2005
presentation. See Footnote 3 for a discussion of discontinued operations.

Concentration of Credit Risk:

The Company sells products to customers in diversified industries
and geographic regions and, therefore, has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The
Company continuously evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers and generally does not require
collateral.

The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
When aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the
case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial
position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to
the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for
bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the
receivables are past due and historical collection experience. If circumstances related to
specific customers change, the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be
further adjusted.

The Company’s forward exchange contracts, long-term cross currency interest rate swaps, and option
contracts do not subject the Company to risk due to foreign exchange rate movement, because gains
and losses on these instruments generally offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and
other transactions being hedged. The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of
non-performance by counterparties to certain derivative financial instruments. The Company does
not obtain collateral or other security to support derivative financial instruments subject to
credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties.

The credit exposure that results from commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange is the
fair value of contracts with a positive fair value as of the reporting date. There is no credit
exposure on the Company’s interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2005. The credit exposure on
foreign currency derivatives at December 31, 2005 was $17.8 million.

Sales Recognition:

Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title
passes and all substantial risks of ownership change, which occurs either upon shipment or upon
delivery based upon contractual terms. Sales is net of provisions for cash discounts, returns,
customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales
related discounts.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on-hand and investments that
have a maturity of three months or less when purchased.


Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value using the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) or first-in, first-out (FIFO) methods (see Footnote 5 for additional information).
The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an
amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based
upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense. Depreciation expense is calculated principally on
the straight-line basis. Useful lives determined by the Company are as follows: buildings and
improvements (20-40 years), and machinery and equipment (3-12 years).

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets:

The Company conducts its annual test of
impairment for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in the third quarter because it
coincides with its annual strategic planning process for all of its businesses. The Company also
tests for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit or the indefinite life intangible asset is below its carrying
amount.

The Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the
reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Such events may include, but are not
limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact
of the economic environment on the Company’s customer base, or a material adverse change in its
relationships with significant customers.

The Company assesses the fair value of its reporting units for its goodwill and other indefinite
lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and tradenames) in its impairment tests generally based upon
a discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flows are estimated utilizing various
assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, terminal value, and market
discount rates. The underlying assumptions used are consistent with those used in the strategic
plan.

Goodwill Impairment

The
Company evaluates goodwill impairment one level below the reporting segment. If the carrying amount
of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value, goodwill impairment may be present. The
Company measures the goodwill impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying assets and
liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, and estimates the
implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.

Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment (primarily Trademarks and Tradenames)

If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is
recorded to the extent the recorded intangible asset exceeds the fair value.

See Footnotes 7 and 18 for additional detail on goodwill and other intangible assets.

Other Long-Lived Assets:

The Company tests its other long-lived assets for impairment in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (“SFAS No. 144”), “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Company
evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other
long-lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in
the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent
or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or
a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow
losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived
asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash
flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable
to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are estimated
utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses,


working capital, and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan.
If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company
determines the assets’ fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a risk-free discount
rate and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying
value of the asset group. Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the
product-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.
See Footnote 18 for additional information.

Shipping and Handling Costs:

The Company records shipping and handling costs as a component of
costs of products sold.

Product Liability Reserves:

The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that
includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer
insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods,
review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining
required product liability reserves. The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account
claims incurred but not reported when determining the Company’s product liability reserve. While
the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of
these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be
material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Product Warranties:

In the normal course of business, the Company offers warranties for a variety
of its products. The specific terms and conditions of the warranties vary depending upon the
specific product and markets in which the products were sold. The Company accrues for the
estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale based on historical experience.

Advertising Costs:

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Cooperative advertising
with customers is recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a reduction of sales and
totaled $170.5 million, $151.4 million, and $184.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. All other advertising costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative
expenses and totaled $147.5 million, $130.1 million and $137.4 million in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

Research and Development Costs:

Research and development costs relating to both future and current
products are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. These costs
aggregated $103.0 million, $105.8 million, and $91.6 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

The Company follows SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. Derivative financial instruments are used only to
manage certain commodity, interest rate and foreign currency risks. These instruments include
commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, long-term cross currency interest rate swaps, forward
exchange contracts and options. The Company’s forward exchange contracts and long-term cross
currency interest rate swaps do not subject the Company to risk due to foreign exchange rate
movement because gains and losses on these instruments generally offset gains and losses on the
assets, liabilities, and other transactions being hedged.

On the date in which the Company enters into a derivative, the derivative is designated as a hedge
of the identified exposure. The Company measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both
at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis.

Interest Rate Risk Management:

Gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow
hedges, to the extent that the hedge relationship has been effective, are deferred in other
comprehensive income and recognized in interest expense over the period in which the Company
recognizes interest expense on the related debt instrument. Any ineffectiveness on these
instruments is immediately recognized in interest expense in the period that the ineffectiveness
occurs.

The Company also has designated certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The Company has
structured all existing interest rate swap agreements to be 100% effective. These instruments
include commodity swaps, interest rate swaps, long-term cross currency interest rate swaps, forward
exchange contracts and option contracts. The Company’s forward exchange contracts, long-term cross
currency interest rate swaps, and option contracts do not


subject the Company to risk due to foreign exchange rate movement, because gains and losses on
these instruments generally offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and other
transactions being hedged. Gains or losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate
swaps are deferred as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related debt and
amortized as an adjustment to the yield of the related debt instrument over the remaining period
originally covered by the swap. The cash received or paid relating to the termination of interest
rate swaps is included in Other as an operating activity in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.

Foreign Currency Management:

The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts and options to manage
foreign exchange risk related to both known and anticipated intercompany transactions and
third-party commercial transaction exposures of approximately one year in duration or less. The
effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other
comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the
hedged transactions affect earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in
earnings.

The Company also utilizes long-term cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge long-term
intercompany financing transactions. Derivative instruments used to hedge intercompany financing
transactions are marked to market with the corresponding gains or losses included in accumulated
other comprehensive income.

The fair value of foreign currency hedging instruments is recorded in the captions Prepaid expenses
and other, Other assets, Other accrued liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets depending on the maturity of the Company’s cross currency interest rate
swaps and forward contracts at December 31, 2005 and 2004. The earnings impact of cash flow hedges
relating to forecasted purchases of inventory is generally reported in cost of products sold to
match the underlying transaction being hedged. For hedged forecasted transactions, hedge
accounting is discontinued if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, in
which case previously deferred hedging gains or losses would be recorded to earnings immediately.

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The Company’s financial instruments include
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable and short and long-term debt. The
fair value of these instruments approximates carrying values due to their short-term duration,
except as follows:

Qualifying Derivative Instruments: The fair value of the Company’s qualifying derivative
instruments is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is described in more detail in
Footnote 11.

Long-term Debt: The fair values of the Company’s long-term debt issued under the medium-term note
program and the junior convertible subordinated debentures were $1,473.6 million and
$345.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005, based on quoted market prices. All other
significant long-term debt is pursuant to floating rate instruments whose carrying amounts
approximate fair value.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into
U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at year-end. The related translation adjustments
are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive income. Income and expenses are translated at
the average monthly rates of exchange in effect during the year. Gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions of these subsidiaries are included in net income. International subsidiaries
operating in highly inflationary economies translate nonmonetary assets at historical rates, while
net monetary assets are translated at current rates, with the resulting translation adjustment
included in net income as other nonoperating (income) expenses.

Income Tax Contingencies:

The Company establishes a tax contingency reserve for certain tax
exposures when it is not probable that the Company’s tax position will be ultimately sustained.
The Company eliminates a tax contingency reserve balance when it becomes probable that the
Company’s tax position will ultimately be sustained, which generally occurs when the statute of
limitations for a specific exposure item has expired or when the Company has reached agreement with
the taxing authorities on the treatment of an item. The Company generally assesses its tax
contingency reserves on a quarterly basis. Management cannot determine with certainty the ultimate
resolution of these tax matters. Actual results may differ from the recorded amounts.

Fair Value of Stock Options:

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised) (“SFAS 123(R)”), “Share-Based
Payment.” SFAS


123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options,
to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values (i.e., pro forma disclosure
is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition). The Statement supersedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and will require adoption no later than January 1, 2006. The Company has adopted the
provisions of the new standard using the modified prospective method and using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model effective January 1, 2006. As a result of adoption, the Company expects to
recognize approximately $15 million to $20 million, pre-tax, in additional expense in
2006.

Prior to 2006, the Company has elected to follow the accounting provisions of APB No. 25 in
accounting for its stock option plans. As a result, the Company grants fixed stock options under
which no compensation cost is recognized. The following table is a reconciliation of the Company’s
net income/(loss) and earnings/(loss) per share to proforma net income/(loss) and proforma
earnings/(loss) per share for the year ended December 31,

Acquisitions of Businesses


On November 23, 2005, the Company acquired DYMO, a global leader in designing, manufacturing and
marketing on-demand labeling solutions, from Esselte. The purchase price was approximately
$730 million, subject to adjustment for working capital and other adjustments. The cash paid
at closing was $706 million, reflecting a


preliminary working capital adjustment relating to Esselte’s retention of certain receivables, as
well as an adjustment relating to a modification of the transaction structure. The final purchase
price is subject to further adjustment relating to changes in the closing working capital. This
acquisition strengthens the Company’s global leadership position in the Office Products segment by
expanding and enhancing the Company’s product lines and customer base. The Company funded the
purchase price payment through a combination of available cash of $487.0 million and debt of
$219.0 million from existing credit facilities.

The Company has preliminarily allocated the purchase price to the identifiable assets. The Company
has not yet obtained all information, including, but not limited to, final independent appraisals
required to complete the purchase price allocation. The final allocation will be completed in
2006. The initial purchase price allocation was based on preliminary data and management’s
estimates at the date of acquisition are as follows

The transaction summarized above was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations are
included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements since the acquisition date. The
acquisition costs were allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

The unaudited consolidated results of operations on a pro forma basis, as though the 2005
acquisition of DYMO had been completed on January 1, 2004, are as follows for the year ended
December 31,

These pro forma financial results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and include
certain adjustments, such as increased interest expense on acquisition debt. They do not reflect
the effect of synergies that are expected to result from integration.


Effective January 1, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of American Saw & Mfg. Co.
(“LENOX”), a leading manufacturer of power tool accessories and hand tools marketed under the LENOX
brand. The purchase price was approximately $450 million paid for through the issuance of
commercial paper, plus transaction costs. The transaction structure permits the deduction of
goodwill for tax purposes, which was estimated to be $85 million at the time of acquisition.
This acquisition and the acquisition of American Tool Companies, Inc. (“IRWIN”) in 2002 marked a
significant expansion and enhancement of the Company’s product lines and customer base, launching
it squarely into the estimated $10 billion-plus global markets for hand tools and power tool
accessories. Both of these acquisitions are reported in the Company’s Tools & Hardware business
segment. The purchase price of the LENOX acquisition was allocated to the acquired assets and
liabilities based on their fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill.

As of December 31, 2005, the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations consist solely
of the European Cookware business.


In June 2005, the Company completed the sale of its Curver business. The Curver business included
the Company’s European indoor organization and home storage division and was previously reported in
the Cleaning & Organization segment. The sales price, which was subject to reduction for working
capital adjustments, was $5 million, paid at closing, plus a note receivable for $5
million, payable within 12 years from closing. The Company may also receive contingent payments,
up to an aggregate maximum of $25 million, based on the adjusted earnings before interest and
taxes of the Curver business for the five years ending December 31, 2009. Due to anticipated
shortfalls in working capital, the Company does not expect to collect any of the $5 million
note receivable. In addition, the Company has not included the contingent payments in the
calculation of the loss on disposal of discontinued operations.

In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a non-cash loss related to the sale of
$62.0 million, net of tax, in 2005, included in the loss on disposal of discontinued
operations in the table above. In 2004, the Company


recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $78.9 million, net of tax, ($34.0 million for
goodwill and $44.9 million for other long-lived assets) related to Curver. The charge is
included in the loss from discontinued operations for 2004 in the table above.

In October 2005, the Company entered into an agreement for the intended sale of its European
Cookware business. The Company completed this divestiture in January 2006. This business included
the brands Pyrex

®

(used under exclusive license from Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa only) and Vitri

®

and was previously included in the Company’s
Other segment.

In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a net loss of $33.9 million, net of
tax, in 2005. The total net loss is reported in the table above as part of the loss on disposal of
discontinued operations.

In the second quarter of 2005, the Company committed to the disposal of a business in the Cleaning
& Organization segment and recognized an impairment loss of $24.5 million, net of tax, in
order to state the assets of this business at their estimated fair values. In the third and fourth
quarters of 2005, the Company revised its estimation related to the fair value of this business
after winning several line reviews with a key retailer and reversed the full amount of the
impairment charge. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company changed its decision to dispose of
this business as a result of the aforementioned line review wins and the identification of
significant productivity opportunities. The results of this business are now reflected in
continuing operations.


In January 2004, the Company completed the sale of its Panex Brazilian low-end cookware division
(previously reported in the Other operating segment) and European picture frames businesses
(previously reported in the Home Fashions operating segment).

In April 2004, the Company sold substantially all of its U.S. picture frame business (Burnes), its
Anchor Hocking glassware business and its Mirro cookware business. Under the terms of the
agreement and final adjustments relating to the transaction, the Company retained the accounts
receivable of the businesses of $76.6 million, and total proceeds, including the retained
receivables, as a result of the transaction were $304 million. The Burnes picture frame
business was previously reported in the Home Fashions operating segment, while the Anchor Hocking
and Mirro businesses were previously reported in the Other operating segment.

In July 2004, the Company completed the sale of Little Tikes Commercial Playground Systems Inc.
(“LTCPS”) to PlayPower, Inc. for approximately $41 million. LTCPS was previously reported in
the Other operating segment, as a unit of the Company’s Little Tikes division. LTCPS is a
manufacturer of commercial playground systems and contained playground environments. The Company
retained the consumer portion of its Little Tikes division.


In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company began exploring various options for certain businesses
previously included in the Home Fashions and Other segments, including evaluating those
businesses for potential sale. As this process progressed, the Company obtained a better
indication of the market value of these businesses and determined that the businesses had a net
book value in excess of their fair value. Due to the apparent decline in value, the Company
conducted a new impairment test in the fourth quarter and recorded impairment charges to

Restructuring Costs

In 2005, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $72.2 million, of which $51.3
million relates to Project Acceleration, and $20.9 million relates to restructuring actions
approved prior to the commencement of Project Acceleration (see below for details).

Project Acceleration

In the third quarter of 2005, the Company announced a global initiative referred to as Project
Acceleration aimed at strengthening and transforming the Company’s portfolio. In connection with
Project Acceleration, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a three-year restructuring
plan (“the Plan”) that commenced in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Plan is designed to reduce
manufacturing overhead to achieve best cost positions, and to allow the Company to increase
investment in new product development, brand building and marketing. Project Acceleration includes
the closures of approximately one-third of the Company’s 80 manufacturing facilities (as of
September 2005), optimizing the Company’s geographic footprint.

The Plan is expected to result in cumulative restructuring charges totaling between $350
million and $400 million ($295 million — $340 million after tax), with between
$170 million and $200 million ($145 million — $170 million after tax) to be
incurred in 2006. Approximately 60% of the charges are expected to be cash charges. Annualized
savings are projected to exceed $120 million upon conclusion of the program in 2008.

Project Acceleration commenced in December 2005, resulting in a non-cash facility restructuring
charge aggregated by reportable business segment as follows (

The restructuring actions approved in 2005 related to Project Acceleration will result in the
closure of 9 facilities, with anticipated cash costs, primarily employee severance, related to
these actions to be between $25 million and $30 million. As of December 31, 2005, no
expenses were recorded related to these cash costs, as notification to the affected employees had
not been made.

Pre-Acceleration Restructuring Activities

The Company announced a significant restructuring plan (the “2001 Plan”) on May 3, 2001. The
specific objectives of the 2001 Plan were to streamline the Company’s supply chain to become the
best-cost global provider throughout the Company’s portfolio by reducing worldwide headcount and
consolidating duplicative manufacturing facilities. The Company recorded $461.7 million in
restructuring charges under the 2001 Plan, including $99.9 million for discontinued
operations. While the accounting charges associated with the 2001 Plan were completed in the
second quarter of 2004, the Company continued to selectively approve individual restructuring
plans. The following table shows the restructuring costs, net of reversals, recognized under the
terms of the 2001 Plan and for the selective restructuring actions prior to Project Acceleration
for the years ended December 31, excluding restructuring costs related to discontinued operations

Restructuring provisions were determined based on estimates prepared at the time the specific
restructuring actions were approved by management, and also include amounts recognized as incurred.
In 2005 and 2004, the Company reduced its restructuring reserve by approximately $6.4 million
and $14.2 million, respectively, primarily as a result of higher proceeds received from the
sale of property, plant and equipment and favorable negotiations on exited contracts. Cash paid
for restructuring activities was $35.5 million, $79.7 million and $77.5 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A summary of the Company’s restructuring plan reserves is as

increase by between $8.0 million to $13.0 million in 2006 primarily due to the
acquisition of DYMO, and remain consistent thereafter, although such amounts may vary based on
fluctuations in foreign currency rates, acquisitions or divestitures, or impairment charges.

casualty liabilities such as workers’ compensation, general and product liability and auto
liability and is estimated based upon historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation
methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs.

FOOTNOTE 9

Credit Arrangements

The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that
are available for short-term financing. Borrowings under the Company’s uncommitted lines of credit
are subject to the discretion of the lender. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had
notes payable to banks in the amount of $4.0 million and $21.3 million, respectively,
with weighted average interest rates of 12.2% and 11.2%, respectively.

In November 2005, the Company entered into a $750.0 million syndicated revolving credit
facility (the “Revolver”) pursuant to a five-year credit agreement. The Revolver, which expires in
November 2010, replaces the Company’s $650.0 million five-year Syndicated Revolving Credit
Agreement that was scheduled to expire in June 2007. At December 31, 2005, there were no
borrowings under the Revolver.

In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $750.0 million of
commercial paper. The Revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue
commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for
borrowing under the Revolver. The Revolver also provides for the issuance of up to $100.0
million of standby letters of credit so long as there is a sufficient amount available for
borrowing under the Revolver. At December 31, 2005, $202.0 million of commercial paper was
outstanding and there were no standby letters of credit issued under the Revolver.

The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The Revolver
requires, among other things, that the Company maintain certain Interest Coverage and Total
Indebtedness to Total Capital


Ratios, as defined in the agreement. The Revolver also limits
Subsidiary Indebtedness. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with the agreement
governing the Revolver.

The medium-term notes, revolving credit agreement (and related commercial paper), preferred debt
securities, and junior convertible subordinated debentures are all unsecured.

Preferred Debt Securities: Under a 2001 receivables facility with a financial institution, the
Company created a financing entity that is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements.
Under this facility, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to
sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the Company’s United States trade receivables to
the financing entity. In 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt
securities to the financial institution. Certain levels of accounts receivable write-offs and
other events would permit the financial institution to terminate the receivables facility and
require redemption of the preferred debt securities. The receivables and preferred debt securities
are recorded in the consolidated accounts of the Company. The financing entity may cause the
preferred debt securities to be exchanged on September 18, 2006 for a two year floating rate note
in an aggregate principal amount equal to the par value of the preferred debt securities plus
accrued but unpaid return. Upon the exchange, the financing entity will pay to the preferred debt
securities holder, a premium for which the Company has accrued $4.6 million as of December 31,
2005. Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to be long-term debt. At
any time prior to maturity of the note, the holder may elect to convert it into new preferred debt
securities of the financing company with a par value equal to the outstanding principal amount of
the note. The preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed, and any note for which such
securities are exchanged must be repaid, before the Company can have access to the financing
entity’s receivables. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the aggregate amount of outstanding
receivables sold under this facility was $746.9 million and $720.9 million, respectively.


Junior Convertible Subordinated Debentures: As of December 31, 2005, the Company fully and
unconditionally guarantees 8.3 million shares of 5.25% convertible preferred securities issued by a
100% owned finance subsidiary of the Company, which are callable at 101.050% of the liquidation
preference, decreasing over time to 100% by December 2007. Each of these “Preferred Securities” is
convertible into 0.9865 of a share of the Company’s common stock, and is entitled to a quarterly
cash distribution at the annual rate of $2.625 per share.

The proceeds of the Preferred Securities were invested in $515.5 million of the Company’s
5.25% Junior Convertible Subordinated Debentures (“Debentures”). The Debentures are the sole
assets of the subsidiary trust, mature on December 1, 2027, bear interest at an annual rate of
5.25%, are payable quarterly and became redeemable by the Company beginning in December 2001. The
Company may defer interest payments on the Debentures for a period of up to 20 consecutive
quarters, during which period distribution payments on the Preferred Securities are also deferred.
Under this circumstance, the Company may not declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to
its common or preferred stock or debt securities that do not rank senior to the Debentures. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company has not elected to defer interest payments.

In 2005 and 2004, the Company purchased 750,000 and 825,000 shares, respectively, of its Preferred
Securities from holders at an average price of $47.075 per share ($35.3 million) and
$43.6875 per share ($36.0 million), respectively. In connection with the purchases of
these securities, the Company negotiated
the early retirement of the corresponding Debentures with the subsidiary trust. The Company
accounted for these transactions as an extinguishment of debt resulting in net gains of $1.7
million and $4.4 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, which were included in Other (income)
expense, net.

Terminated Interest Rate Swaps: At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying amount of long-term
debt and current maturities thereof includes $24.8 million (of which $12.8 million is
classified as current) and $38.3 million, respectively, relating to terminated interest rate
swap agreements.

Effective March 9, 2004, the Company terminated an interest rate swap agreement prior to the
scheduled maturity date and received cash of $9.2 million. Of this amount, $5.5 million
represented the fair value of the swap that was terminated and the remainder represents net
interest receivable on the swap. The cash received relating to the fair value of the swap has been
included in Other as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. On March
9, 2004, the Company entered into a fixed to floating rate swap that effectively replaced the
terminated swap.

FOOTNOTE 11

Derivative Financial Instruments

Interest Rate Risk Management: At December 31, 2005, the Company had interest rate swaps
designated as fair value hedges with an outstanding notional principal amount of $650.0
million, with a net accrued interest payable of $2.6 million. There is no credit exposure on
the Company’s interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2005.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had long-term cross currency interest rate swaps with an
outstanding notional principal amount of $285.5 million, with a net accrued interest
receivable of $0.8 million. The maturities on these long-term cross currency interest rate
swaps range from three to four years.

Foreign Currency Management: The following table summarizes the Company’s forward exchange
contracts, long-term cross currency interest rate swaps and option contracts in U.S. dollars by
major currency and contractual amount. The “buy” amounts represent the U.S. equivalent of
commitments to purchase foreign currencies, and the “sell” amounts represent the U.S. equivalent of
commitments to sell foreign currencies according to the local needs of the subsidiaries. The
contractual amounts of significant forward exchange contracts, long-term cross currency interest
rate swaps and option contracts and their fair values as of
December 31, were as follows (

Employee Benefit and Retirement Plans

As of December 31, 2005, the Company maintained various non-qualified deferred compensation plans
with varying terms. The total liability associated with these plans was $68.1 million and
$64.9 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These liabilities are included
in Other Noncurrent Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These plans are partially
funded with asset balances of $32.8 million and $35.3 million as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. These assets are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which is a nonqualified defined
benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key
employees upon retirement based upon the employees’ years of service and compensation. The SERP is
partially funded through a trust agreement with the Northern Trust Company, as trustee, that owns
life insurance policies on key employees. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the life insurance
contracts had a cash surrender value of $76.0 million and $68.9 million, respectively.
These assets are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The projected
benefit obligation was $79.6 million and $78.2 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The SERP liabilities are included in the pension table below; however, the Company’s
investment in the life insurance contracts are excluded from the table as they do not qualify as
plan assets under SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.”

The Company and its subsidiaries have noncontributory pension, profit sharing and contributory
401(k) plans covering substantially all of their foreign and domestic employees. Plan benefits are
generally based on years of service and/or compensation. The Company’s funding policy is to
contribute not less than the minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or foreign statutes to
assure that plan assets will be adequate to provide retirement benefits.


The Company’s matching contributions to the contributory 401(k) plans were $15.4 million,
$18.7 million and $21.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The Company uses a September 30th measurement date for the majority of its plans. The following
provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of the Company’s
noncontributory defined benefit pension plans, including the SERP, as of December 31, (

There are no plan assets associated with the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans. The
total accrued benefit cost of these plans is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other
non-current liabilities.

The weighted average discount rate at the measurement dates for the Company’s other post-retirement
benefit plans is developed using a spot interest yield curve based upon a broad population of
corporate bonds rated AA or higher, adjusted to match the duration of each plan’s benefits. The

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions,” the Company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment
at December 31, 2005. In 2005, the Company recorded a charge to equity of $59.8 million, net
of tax. The reduction to stockholders’ equity did not affect net income, but is included in other
comprehensive income. The Company believes that its pension plan has the appropriate long-term
investment strategy and the Company’s liquidity position is expected to remain strong.

Assumed health care cost trends have been used in the valuation of postretirement benefits. The
trend rate is 9% (for retirees under age 65) and 11% (for retirees over age 65) in 2005, declining
to 6% for all retirees in 2011 and thereafter.

The health care cost trend rate significantly affects the reported postretirement benefit costs and
obligations. A one-percentage point change in the assumed rate would have the following effects

The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income
investments is used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
Risk tolerance is established


through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial
condition. The investment portfolio is comprised of a diversified blend of equity, real estate and
fixed income investments. Equity investments include large and small market capitalization stocks
as well as growth, value and international stock positions. The Company’s common stock comprised
zero and $41.1 million of noncontributory pension plan assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

The Company employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return for plan
assets. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and
fixed-income are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets
with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors, such
as inflation and interest rates, are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are
determined. The long-term portfolio return is established via a building block approach with
proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing. Peer data and historical returns are
reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

In 2005, the Company made a voluntary $25.0 million cash contribution to its foreign pension
plans, primarily in the United Kingdom. In 2004, the Company made a voluntary $50.0 million
cash contribution to its U.S. defined benefit plan.

Estimated future benefit payments under the Company’s defined benefit pension plans and other
post-retirement benefit plans are as follows as of December 31, 2005 (

The other postretirement benefit payments are net of the annual Medicare Part D subsidy of
approximately $20 million beginning in fiscal 2006.

Effective December 31, 2004, the Company froze its defined benefit pension plan for its entire
non-union U.S. workforce. As a result of this curtailment, the Company reduced its pension
obligation by $50.3 million and recorded a curtailment gain related to negative prior service
cost in 2005 of $15.8 million. In conjunction with this action, the Company offered special
termination benefits to certain employees who accepted early retirement. The Company replaced the
defined benefit pension plan with an additional defined contribution plan, whereby the Company will
make additional contributions to the Company sponsored employee’s profit sharing plan. The new
defined contribution plan has a five-year cliff-vesting schedule, but allows credit for service
rendered prior to the inception of the defined contribution plan. For 2005, the Company recorded
$21.4 million in expense for the defined contribution plan. The liability associated with
this plan as of December 31, 2005 is $21.4 million and is included in other accrued
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Dilutive securities include “in the money options” and restricted stock awards.
The weighted average shares outstanding for 2005, 2004 and 2003 exclude the dilutive
effect of approximately 9.6 million, 10.6 million and 9.2 million options,
respectively, because such options had an exercise price in excess of the average
market value of the Company’s common stock during the respective years.

(2)

The convertible preferred securities are anti-dilutive in 2005, 2004 and 2003
and, therefore, have been excluded from diluted earnings per share. Had the
convertible preferred shares been included in the diluted earnings per share
calculation, net income would be increased by $14.4 million, $16.2 million
and $16.6 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and weighted average shares outstanding would be increased by 8.4 million shares, 9.7 million shares and
9.9 million shares in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

FOOTNOTE 15

Stockholders’ Equity

In January 2003, the Company completed the sale of 6.67 million shares of its common stock at a
public offering price of $30.10 per share pursuant to an effective shelf registration
statement that was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The net proceeds
of $200.1 million were used to reduce the Company’s commercial paper borrowings.

Each share of the Company’s common stock includes a stock purchase right (a “Right”). Each Right
will entitle the holder, until the earlier of October 31, 2008 or the redemption of the Rights, to
buy the number of shares of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of
$200.00, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The Rights will be exercisable
only if a person or group acquires 15% or more of voting power of the Company or announces a tender
offer after which it would hold 15% or more of the Company’s voting power. The Rights held by the
15% stockholder would not be exercisable in this situation.

Furthermore, if, following the acquisition by a person or group of 15% or more of the Company’s
voting stock, the Company was acquired in a merger or other business combination or 50% or more of
its assets were sold, each Right (other than Rights held by the 15% stockholder) would become
exercisable for that number of shares of common stock of the Company (or the surviving company in a
business combination) having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.

The Company may redeem the Rights at $0.001 per Right prior to the occurrence of an event that
causes the Rights to become exercisable for common stock.

FOOTNOTE 16

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards

The Company’s Amended and Restated 1993 Stock Option Plan expired on December 31, 2002. For
options previously granted under that plan, the option exercise price equaled the common stock’s
closing price on the date of grant; options vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from
the date of grant. In 2003, a new plan was approved by the Company stockholders (“2003 Plan”).
The 2003 Plan provides for grants of up to an aggregate of 15.0 million stock options, stock awards
and performance shares (except that no more than 3.0 million of those grants may be stock awards
and performance shares). Under the 2003 Plan, the option exercise price equals the


common stock’s closing price on the date of grant. Options will vest over five years (which may be
shortened to no less than three years) and expire ten years from the date of grant. Also under the
2003 Plan, none of the restrictions on stock awards will lapse earlier than the third anniversary
of the date of grant.

The following summarizes the changes in the number of shares of common stock under option,
including options to acquire common stock resulting from the conversion of options under pre-merger

The Company also grants restricted stock awards to directors and certain employees. Generally,
these awards are subject to three-year cliff vesting and pay dividends quarterly. As of December

0.4 million shares, respectively, none of which are vested. Total compensation expense of
$5.7 million and $2.8 million was recorded in 2005 and 2004, respectively related to the

At December 31, 2005, the Company had foreign net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of
approximately $649.1 million, most of which carryforward without expiration. The potential
tax benefits associated with those foreign net operating losses are approximately $206.5
million. The valuation allowance decreased $15.7 million during 2005 to $232.6 million
at December 31, 2005. This decrease is primarily due to foreign net operating losses generated
during the year which management is uncertain as to the ability to utilize in the future, reduced
by foreign net operating losses no longer available for use due to business changes and
divestitures.

No U.S. deferred taxes have been provided on the undistributed non-U.S. subsidiary earnings that
are considered to be permanently invested. At December 31, 2005, the estimated amount of total
unremitted non-U.S. subsidiary earnings is $387.0 million.

Resolution of Tax Contingencies


In January 2005, the Company reached agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relating to
the appropriate treatment of a specific deduction included in the Company’s 2003 U.S. federal
income tax return. The Company requested accelerated review of the transaction under the IRS’
Pre-Filing Agreement Program that resulted in affirmative resolution in late January 2005. A
$58.6 million benefit was recorded in income taxes for 2005 related to this issue. The amount
was fully reserved as of December 31, 2004.

In 2005, the statute of limitations on certain tax positions for which the Company had provided tax
reserves, in whole or in part, expired resulting in the reversal of the provisions and interest
accrued thereon in the amounts of $15.3 million.


In 2004, the Company received a refund of $2.9 million from the IRS relating to amounts
previously paid and recorded this amount as a reduction to income taxes. Also during 2004, the
statute of limitations on certain transactions for which the Company had provided tax reserves, in
whole or in part, expired resulting in the reversal of the provisions and interest accrued thereon
in the amount of $43.6 million. Accordingly, the impact was recorded as a reduction to income
taxes.

In 2004, due to significant restructuring activity and certain changes in the Company’s business
model affecting the utilization of net operating loss carryovers, particularly in certain European
countries, the valuation allowance on certain net operating losses previously tax-benefited has
been increased by $31.0 million. This amount was recorded in income taxes for 2004.

FOOTNOTE 18

Impairment Charges


In 2005, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $34.4 million ($19.5 million
goodwill, $12.2 million trademarks and tradenames, and $2.7 million in property, plant
and equipment) related to its United Kingdom window fashion business, which is included in the
Company’s Home Fashions segment. Restructuring and other investments made in the business in prior
years have not resulted in the expected returns. Additionally, the business continues to face
economic challenges, as retailers move to a direct product sourcing model. The Company is
exploring alternatives for this business. As a result of these factors, management performed the
required impairment tests and determined that an impairment charge was required. The Company used
the discounted cash flows method to determine the estimated fair market value of the business.



As a result of the impairment testing performed in 2004, the Company recorded non-cash impairment
charges of $295.1 million ($273.5 million, net of tax), as follows:

In 2004, the Company made the decision to exit certain product lines, which resulted in the
impairment of fixed assets. The Company determined the fair value of the fixed assets by
estimating the future cash flows attributable to these fixed assets, including an estimate of the
ultimate sale proceeds. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge to write-down the assets to
their estimated fair value.

Office Products

The impairment charge recorded in the Office Products segment was primarily a result of three
factors:

•

Prior year restructuring activity related to a European business
had not resulted in the expected returns, and management began
exploring alternatives for this product line. Accordingly, an
impairment charge was recorded to write-down the long-lived assets
to fair value (disposal value). The impairment charge recognized
on this product line was $80.8 million, of which $8.5
million related to the write-down of property, plant & equipment.

•

In the European business, the Company historically promoted and
supported several different businesses in the everyday writing
category. In 2004, management developed a plan to consolidate
certain businesses in Europe in this category. This new plan
resulted from several factors:

•

The Company believes that rationalizing its brands will enable the Company to more
effectively allocate capital and other resources. In this regard, the Company is focused
on promoting its brands globally and reducing the reliance on local or regional brands.

•

The brand targeted for rationalization had experienced sales declines, especially in
2004, and management believed it has more effective investment opportunities outside of
this brand.

As a result of this plan, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $123.1 million
related to this product line.

•

Management decided to rationalize several trademarks and tradenames (brands), primarily in
the Latin America businesses. The current plan is to reduce the number of brands from 76 to
12 by 2007. As a result of this decision, the Company determined that certain brands that
were previously considered to have indefinite lives were impaired. Accordingly, the Company
wrote-down these trademarks and tradenames to their fair value and began amortizing these
brands over their remaining useful lives (generally three years). The total impairment charge
recognized as a result of the decision to rationalize brands was $37.2 million.


The remaining impairment charge recognized in 2004 represents a write-down to fair value of certain
other long-lived assets.

Management decided to rationalize certain trademarks and tradenames (brands), primarily in the
United Kingdom home fashions business, in order to focus on promoting more effective brands. As a
result of this decision the Company determined that these brands became impaired and accordingly,
these trademarks and tradenames, as well as certain associated patents, were written-off. The
impairment charge associated with this decision was $17.2 million. Additionally, primarily as
a result of an increase from the prior year in the discount rate (risk adjusted rate) used in
calculating the enterprises’ fair value, an impairment charge of $8.4 million was recorded on
goodwill.

The remaining impairment charge recognized in 2004 represents a write-down to fair value of certain
trademarks and tradenames associated with product lines that the Company planned on exiting.

Tools & Hardware / Other

The impairment charge recorded in the Tools & Hardware and Other segments primarily relates to
patents that the Company chose to allow to expire and fixed assets that were held for sale, and
accordingly, were written-down to fair value.

In 2004, the Company began exploring various options for certain businesses and product lines in
the Tools & Hardware segment, including evaluating those businesses for potential sale. As this
process progressed, the Company determined that the businesses had a net book value in excess of
their fair value. Due to the apparent decline in value, the Company conducted an impairment test
and recorded an impairment loss to write-down the net assets of these businesses and product lines
to fair value.


The Company recognized an impairment charge of $34.5 million, primarily related to the
decision to exit certain product lines, most of which were in the Cleaning & Organization segment.

FOOTNOTE 21

Litigation and Contingencies

The Company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. These
proceedings include claims for damages arising out of use of the Company’s products, allegations of
infringement of intellectual property, commercial disputes and employment matters as well as
environmental matters described below. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive
as well as compensatory damages, and certain proceedings purport to be class actions.

The Company, using current product sales data and historical trends, actuarially calculates the
estimate of its exposure for product liability. As a result of the most recent analysis, the
Company has product liability reserves of $28.3 million as of December 31, 2005. The
Corporation is insured for product liability claims for amounts in excess of established
deductibles and accrues for the estimated liability as described up to the limits of the
deductibles. All other claims and lawsuits are handled on a case-by-case basis.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company was involved in various matters concerning federal and state
environmental laws and regulations, including matters in which the Company has been identified by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies as a potentially
responsible party (“PRP”) at contaminated sites under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and equivalent state laws.

In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has considered several factors,
including the extent of the Company’s volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of
other PRPs; the kind of waste; the terms of existing cost sharing and other applicable agreements;
the financial ability of other PRPs to share in the payment of requisite costs; the Company’s prior
experience with similar sites; environmental studies and cost estimates available to the Company;
the effects of inflation on cost estimates; and the extent to which the Company’s, and other
parties’, status as PRPs is disputed.

The Company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of December
31, 2005 ranged between $12.8 million and $23.8 million. As of December 31, 2005, the
Company had a reserve equal to $15.4 million for such environmental response costs in the
aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. No insurance recovery was taken into account in determining the
Company’s cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any
discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to four long-term (30 year) operations
and maintenance CERCLA matters which are estimated at present value of $5.6 million.

Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and response activities,
the possibility that the Company could be identified as a PRP at sites identified in the future
that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the possibility of additional sites
as a result of businesses acquired, actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from the
Company’s estimates.

Although management of the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings
with certainty, it believes that the ultimate resolution of the Company’s legal proceedings,
including any amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts reserved, will not have a
material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the normal course of business and as part of its acquisition and divestiture strategy, the
Company may provide certain representations and indemnifications related to legal, environmental,
product liability, tax or other types of issues. Based on the nature of these representations and
indemnifications, it is not possible to predict the maximum potential payments under all of these
agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and
circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company
under these agreements did not have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial
condition or results of operation.


As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $96.7 million in standby letters of credit primarily
related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product
liability, and medical.
