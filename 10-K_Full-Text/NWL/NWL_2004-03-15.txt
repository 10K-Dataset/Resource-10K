GENERAL

The Company is a global manufacturer and full-service marketer of name-brand
consumer products serving the needs of volume purchasers, including
department/specialty stores and warehouse clubs, home centers and hardware
stores, and office superstores and contract stationers. The Company’s basic
business strategy is to merchandise a multi-product offering of everyday
consumer products, backed by an obsession with customer service excellence and
new product development, in order to achieve maximum results for its
stockholders. The Company’s multi-product offering consists of name-brand
consumer products in five business segments: Cleaning and Organization; Office
Products; Home Fashions; Tools and Hardware; and Other. The Company’s
financial objectives are to achieve above-average sales and earnings per share
growth, maintain a superior return on investment and maintain a conservative
level of debt.

The Company’s six transformational strategic initiatives are as follows:
Productivity, Streamlining, New Product Development, Marketing, Strategic
Account Management, and Collaboration.

Productivity is the initiative to reduce the cost of manufacturing a product
by at least five percent per year, every year in order to become the best cost
supplier. Streamlining is the commitment to reduce non-value added costs and
cut out excess layers. New Product Development represents the commitment to
develop and introduce cutting-edge, innovative new products to the market and
develop best-cost products to meet end-user needs. The Marketing initiative
represents the Company’s commitment to transform from a “push” to “pull”
marketing organization, focusing on the end-user. The Strategic Account
Management initiative represents the Company’s program to allocate resources
to those strategic retailers the Company believes will continue to grow in the
future. Collaboration is the Company’s initiative for the divisional
operating units to work together and maximize economies of scale and the use
of best practices.

Refer to the forward-looking statements section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis for a discussion of the Company’s forward-looking statements.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

In 2003, the Company made several organizational changes, divided the company
into two major groups, and named two chief operating officers. As of December
31, 2003, the Company realigned its reporting segments to reflect the changes
in the Company’s structure and to more appropriately reflect the Company’s
focus on building large consumer brands, promoting organizational integration,
achieving operating efficiencies and aligning the businesses with the
Company’s strategic account management strategy. The realignment streamlines
what had previously been four operating segments (prior years’ segment data
has been reclassified to conform to the current segment structure). The
Company reports its results in five reportable segments as follows:

GROWTH STRATEGY

The Company’s growth strategy emphasizes internal growth and acquisitions.

Internal Growth

The Company has grown internally principally by introducing new products,
entering new domestic and international markets, adding new customers,
cross-selling existing product lines to current customers and supporting its
U.S.-based customers’ international expansion. Internal growth is defined by
the Company as growth from its “core businesses,” which include continuing
businesses owned more than one year and minor acquisitions. The Company’s
goal is to achieve above-average internal growth.

Acquisition Strategy

The Company supplements internal growth by acquiring businesses with prominent
consumer-focused, retail brands and improving the profitability of such
businesses through the implementation of the Company’s strategic initiatives.
Other strategic criteria for an acquisition include the Company’s ability to
grow the business, its importance to key customers, its relationship to
existing product lines, its function as a low-cost source of supply, its
ability to provide the Company with an entrance into a new market, and the
extent to which the Company can utilize the Phoenix Program in operating the
business. In addition, the Company will consider the business’ actual and
potential impact on the operating performance of the Company’s Group at issue.
While the Company evaluates alternatives continuously, its priority will be
to reduce debt rather than invest in significant acquisitions over the next
12-18 months. See Item 6 and Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a description of recent transactions.

Selective Globalization

The Company is pursuing selective international opportunities to further its
internal growth and acquisition objectives. The rapid growth of consumer
goods economies and retail structures in several regions outside the U.S.,
particularly Europe, Mexico and South America, makes them attractive to the
Company by providing selective opportunities to acquire businesses, develop
partnerships with new foreign customers and extend relationships with the
Company’s domestic customers whose businesses are growing internationally.
The Company’s recent acquisitions, combined with existing sales to foreign
customers, increased its sales outside the U.S. to approximately 29% of total
sales in 2003 from 27% of total sales in 2002 and 2001.

Additional information regarding acquisitions of businesses is included in
Item 6 and Footnote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

DIVESTITURE AND PRODUCT LINE RATIONALIZATION

The Company’s divestiture and product line rationalization strategy emphasizes
the divestiture of businesses and product offerings that do not meet the
Company’s long-term strategic goals and objectives.

The Company consistently reviews its businesses and product offerings, assesses
their strategic fit and seeks opportunities to divest of non-strategic
businesses. The criteria used by the Company in assessing the strategic fit
include: the Company’s ability to grow the business; its importance to key
customers; its relationship to existing product lines; its impact to the
market; and the business’ actual and potential impact on the operating
performance of the Company.

The priority is to divest non-core businesses at reasonable valuations. See
Footnotes 2 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description
of recent transactions.



STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Productivity

The Company’s objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing a product by at
least five percent per year on an ongoing basis with the goal of becoming the
best-cost supplier to our customers. To achieve productivity, the Company
focuses on reducing purchasing costs, materials handling costs, manufacturing
inefficiencies, and excess overhead costs to reduce the overall cost of
manufacturing products.

The planned deployment of Newell Operational Excellence (NWL OPEX) throughout
the Company’s manufacturing network is aimed to deliver the Company’s
productivity targets. NWL OPEX is designed to be a methodical process focused
on lean manufacturing which includes installing the right manufacturing and
distribution metrics and driving improvements quarter after quarter. In
addition to the cost reductions, other key components of NWL OPEX are improved
quality and service levels and the reduction of inventory lead times.

Streamlining

The streamlining initiative represents the Company’s commitment and focus on
reducing non-value added activities and excess layers within the organization.
The Company’s goal is to use the savings generated from streamlining to fund
marketing and other key initiatives, without increasing total expenses. The
Company is vigilant in creating a leaner organization that is more flexible in
its response time, both internally and externally.

New Product Development

The Company is determined to become the leader in introducing cutting-edge,
innovative, and patented new products to the marketplace. The Company seeks
to employ the best and brightest new product engineers in order to achieve
this goal through the implementation and execution of a world-class product
development process. The Company’s intention is to become a “new product
machine” that will enhance the brand image and help secure additional store
listings.

Marketing

The Company’s objective is to develop long-term, mutually beneficial
partnerships with its customers and become their supplier of choice. To
achieve this goal, the Company has a value-added marketing program that offers
a family of leading brand name staple products, tailored sales programs,
innovative merchandising support, in-store services and responsive top
management.

The Company’s marketing skills help customers stimulate store traffic and
sales through timely advertising and innovative promotions. The Company also
assists customers in differentiating their offerings by customizing products
and packaging. Through self-selling packaging and displays that emphasize
good-better-best value relationships, retail customers are encouraged to trade
up to higher-value, best quality products.

The Company is also committed to selective media advertising, including
national television advertising where appropriate, in order to increase brand
awareness among end-users of the product.

Customer service also involves customer contact with top-level decision makers
at the Company’s divisions. As part of its decentralized structure, the
Company’s division presidents are the chief marketing officers of their
product lines and communicate directly with customers. This structure permits
early recognition of market trends and timely response to customer problems.



Phoenix Program

The marketing effort focuses largely on an extensive grass roots marketing
campaign, highlighted by our Phoenix Program, which was introduced in 2001.
This initiative is an action-oriented field sales force consisting of recent
university graduates. The team works in the field, primarily within our
Strategic Account structure, performing in-store product demonstrations, event
marketing, on-shelf merchandising, interacting with the end-user, and
maintaining an ongoing relationship with store personnel. This initiative
allows the Company to enhance product placement and minimize stock outages
and, together with the Strategic Account Management Program, to maximize shelf
space potential.

Strategic Account Management

The Strategic Account Management Program is the Company’s sales and marketing
approach that focuses growth efforts on strategic accounts with high long-term
growth potential. Separate sales organizations have been established to more
effectively manage the relationship at the largest strategic accounts,
specifically Wal*Mart, The Home Depot and Lowe’s. As part of this program, the
Company established President level positions to more effectively manage the
relationships with these accounts. The program allows the Company to present
these customers with “one face” to enhance the Company’s response time,
understand the customer’s needs and support the best possible customer
relationship.

Collaboration

Collaboration represents the Company’s focus to benefit from the sharing of
best practices and the reduction of costs achieved through economies of scale.
For example, functions, such as purchasing and distribution and
transportation, have been centralized to increase buying power across the
Company.

Additionally, certain administrative functions are centralized at the
corporate level including cash management, accounting systems, capital
expenditure approvals, order processing, billing, credit, accounts receivable,
data processing operations and legal functions. Centralization concentrates
technical expertise in one location, making it easier to observe overall
business trends and manage the Company’s businesses.

OTHER INFORMATION

Multi-Product Offering

The Company’s increasingly broad product coverage in multiple product lines
permits it to more effectively meet the needs of its customers. With families
of leading, brand name products and profitable new products, the Company also
can help volume purchasers sell a more profitable product mix. As a potential
single source for an entire product line, the Company can use program
merchandising to improve product presentation, optimize display space for both
sales and income and encourage impulse buying by retail customers.

Customer Service

The Company believes that one of the primary ways it distinguishes itself from
its competitors is through customer service. The Company’s ability to provide
superior customer service is a result of its information technology, marketing
and merchandising programs designed to enhance the sales and profitability of
its customers and consistent on-time delivery of its products.

On-Time Delivery

A critical element of the Company’s customer service is consistent on-time
delivery of products to its customers. Retailers are pursuing a number of
strategies to deliver the highest-quality, best-cost products to their
customers. A growing trend among retailers is to purchase on a “just-in-time”
basis in order to reduce inventory costs and increase returns on investment.
As retailers shorten their lead times for orders, manufacturers need to more
closely anticipate consumer-buying patterns. The Company supports its retail
customers’ “just-in-time” inventory strategies through investments in improved
forecasting systems, more responsive manufacturing and distribution



capabilities and electronic communications. The Company manufactures the vast
majority of its products and has extensive experience in high-volume,
cost-effective manufacturing. The high-volume nature of its manufacturing
processes and the relatively consistent demand for its products enable the
Company to ship most products directly from its factories without the need for
independent warehousing and distribution centers.

Foreign Operations

Information regarding the Company’s 2003, 2002 and 2001 foreign operations and
financial information by geographic area are included in Footnote 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein.

Raw Materials

The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for
substantially all of its material requirements. The raw materials and various
purchased components required for its products have generally been available
in sufficient quantities.

Backlog

The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.

Seasonal Variations

The Company’s product groups are only moderately affected by seasonal trends.
The Cleaning and Organization business segment typically has higher sales in
the second half of the year due to retail stocking related to the holiday
season; the Tools and Hardware and Home Fashions business segments typically
have higher sales in the second and third quarters due to an increased level
of do-it-yourself projects completed in the summer months; and the Office
Products business segment has higher sales in the second and third quarters
due to the back-to-school season. Because these seasonal trends are moderate,
the Company’s consolidated quarterly sales do not fluctuate significantly,
unless a significant acquisition is made.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company has many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that
are, in the aggregate, increasingly important to its business. The Company
believes that no individual patent, trademark, brand name or trade name, other
than the United States registered “Rubbermaid” trademark, is material to its
consolidated operations.

Competition

The Company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of
consumer products, many of which are large and well-established. The
Company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount
stores, home centers, warehouse clubs and office superstores. The rapid
growth of these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer
shopping patterns, have contributed to a significant consolidation of the
consumer products retail industry and the formation of dominant multi-category
retailers, many of which have strong bargaining power with suppliers. This
environment significantly limits the Company’s ability to recover cost
increases through selling prices. Other trends among retailers are to foster
high levels of competition among suppliers, to demand that manufacturers
supply innovative new products and to require suppliers to maintain or reduce
product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times. Another trend,
in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong end-user
brands, is for the retailer to import generic products directly from foreign
sources. The combination of these market influences has created an intensely
competitive environment in which the Company’s principal customers
continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in pricing
pressures and the need for strong end-user brands, the ongoing introduction of
innovative new products and continuing improvements in customer service.

For more than 30 years, the Company has positioned itself to respond to the
challenges of this retail environment by developing strong relationships with
large, high-volume purchasers. The Company markets its strong



multi-product offering through virtually every category of high-volume
retailer, including discount, drug, grocery and variety chains, warehouse
clubs, department, hardware and specialty stores, home centers, office
superstores, contract stationers and military exchanges. The Company’s
largest customer, Wal*Mart (which includes Sam’s Club), accounted for
approximately 16% of net sales in 2003. Other top ten customers included (

in
alphabetical order

): Ace Hardware, Lowe’s, Office Depot, Office Max, Staples,
Target, The Home Depot, Toys ‘R Us and United Stationers.

The Company’s other principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges
are high brand name recognition, superior customer service (including industry
leading information technology, innovative “good-better-best” marketing and
merchandising programs), consistent on-time delivery, decentralized
manufacturing and marketing, centralized administration, and experienced
management.

Environment

Information regarding the Company’s environmental matters is included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of this report and in Footnote 17
to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference
herein.

Research and Development

Information regarding the Company’s research and development costs for each of
the past three fiscal years is included in Footnote 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately 40,000 employees
worldwide, of whom approximately 7,400 are covered by collective bargaining
agreements or, in certain countries, other collective arrangements decreed by
statute.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis provides information which management
believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company’s
consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements. It includes the following sections:

Executive Overview

Newell Rubbermaid is a global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer
products and their commercial extensions, serving a wide array of retail
channels including department stores, discount stores, warehouse clubs, home
centers, hardware stores, commercial distributors, office superstores,
contract stationers, automotive stores, and pet superstores. The Company
markets a multi-product offering of consumer products backed by an obsession
with customer service and new product development. The Company conducts
businesses in five operating segments as follows:

Segment

Description of Products

Cleaning & Organization

Indoor/outdoor organization, storage, food storage, cleaning, refuse

Office Products

Ballpoint/roller ball pens, markers, highlighters, pencils, office products,

art supplies

Home Fashions

Drapery houseware, window treatments, frames

Tools & Hardware

Hand tools, power tool
accessories, manual paint applicators, cabinet hardware, propane
torches

Other

Operating segments that do not meet aggregation criteria, including aluminum

and stainless steel cookware, glassware, hair care accessory products, infant

and juvenile products, including toys, high chairs, car seats, strollers,

outdoor play equipment

2003 Overview:

In 2003, the Company increased sales by $296.1 million, primarily as a result
of its acquisition of American Saw & Mfg. Company (“Lenox”), as discussed more
fully below. While the Company saw sales growth in many of its high margin
businesses, including Sharpie permanent markers and Irwin hand tools and power
tool accessories, the Company experienced significant pricing pressure in some
of its low-end product lines, primarily low-end cookware and picture frames
businesses. As a result of these pressures, the Company began to rationalize
these product lines, identifying approximately $300 million in annual sales
that would not yield the Company’s targeted returns. By the end of 2003, the
Company exited approximately $50 million in sales of these low-margin product
lines. This rationalization process will continue in 2004.

Gross margin decreased 0.9 points to 26.7% in 2003, primarily related to
unfavorable pricing of 1.9%, partially offset by net productivity gains. Gross
margin was also adversely affected by increases in raw material costs,
particularly in resin, which resulted in approximately $75 million in increased
costs in 2003 compared to 2002. Resin prices are expected to increase further
in the first quarter of 2004.



Cash flow from operations was $773.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, compared to $868.9 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash
provided from operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in earnings
before non-cash charges of $29.0 million and a net decrease in accrued
liabilities and other assets, partially
offset by decreases in inventory and accounts receivable which netted to a
use of $74.2 million. The Company has
decreased inventory as a percentage of sales to 13.8% in 2003 from 16.0% in
2002. The decrease in inventory provided the Company with $179.4 million in
operating cash flow in 2003. See sources and uses below for further
discussion.

Despite the challenges experienced in 2003, the Company continued to make
progress in executing its strategy. The following section highlights that
progress:

Acquisition Integration

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company acquired Lenox, a leading manufacturer
of power tool accessories and hand tools marketed under the Lenox brand, for
approximately $450 million paid for through the issuance of commercial paper,
plus transaction costs of $5.8 million. Additionally, the Company completed
its integration of American Tool Companies, Inc. (“Irwin”), which was
acquired in April of 2002.

The acquisitions of Lenox and
Irwin marked a significant expansion and
enhancement of the Company’s product lines and customer base, launching it
squarely into the estimated $10 billion-plus global markets for hand tools and
power tool accessories.

Divestitures

The Company consistently reviews its businesses and product offerings and
assesses their strategic fit. The Company has identified several businesses
that it believes do not fit the Company’s long-term strategic objectives. The
consolidated sales of all these businesses that the Company has determined are
non-strategic were approximately $875 million in 2003.

In 2003, the Company began marketing several of these businesses for potential
sale, successfully divesting several businesses in 2003. These businesses
included the Cosmolab business, German picture frame business, and some
smaller business units. Refer to Footnote 2 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional details. In addition, the Company recorded
impairment charges for several other businesses where various strategic
alternatives were being considered (See Footnote 14 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional details).

In February 2004, the Company finalized the sale of Panex, a Brazilian
cookware business and the remainder of its European picture frames business.
As a result of these sales, the Company recorded a loss of
approximately $78 million in the first quarter of 2004. Refer to Footnote 18
of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on these
transactions.

On March 14, 2004, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of its U.S. picture frame business (Burnes), its Anchor Hocking glassware business and its Mirro cookware business.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will retain the accounts receivable of the businesses and expects gross proceeds as a result of the transaction to be approximately $310 million. The Burnes picture frames business is included in the Home Fashions business segment. The Anchor Hocking
and Mirro businesses are included in the Other business segment. Collectively, these businesses had net sales of approximately $695 million in 2003. The Company expects to record a non-cash pre-tax loss of approximately $25 million on the sale of these businesses. Closing
of the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and certain other customary conditions. Refer to Footnote 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on these transactions.

Restructuring

In 2003, the Company continued its efforts to streamline its worldwide supply
chain to strengthen its position with the goal of becoming the best-cost
global provider throughout its product range. The three-year plan, which
began in 2001, consists of reducing worldwide headcount and consolidating
duplicate manufacturing and warehouse facilities. Under the Company’s
restructuring plan, the Company expects to exit 84 facilities and reduce
headcount by approximately 12,000 people. At the plan’s completion, the
Company expects total annual savings of between $150 and
$175 million ($125 to
$135 million related to the reduced headcount, $10 to $15 million related to
reduced depreciation, and $15 to $25 million related to other cash savings).
In 2003, the Company exited 21 facilities and terminated approximately 6,000
employees and recorded restructuring charges of $245.0 million. To date, the
Company has exited 78 facilities and terminated approximately 10,800 employees
and recorded approximately $417 million related to its restructuring plans.
The Company anticipates recording the final restructuring charges related to
the 2001 restructuring plan (expected to be between $43 and $63 million) by
the end of the second quarter of 2004. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional details.



Organizational Changes

In 2003, the Company made several organizational changes, effectively divided
the Company into two major groups, and named two chief operating officers. As
of December 31, 2003, the Company realigned its reporting segments to reflect
the changes in the Company’s structure and to more appropriately reflect the
Company’s focus on building large consumer brands, promoting organizational
integration, achieving operating efficiencies and aligning the businesses with
the Company’s strategic account management strategy.

2004 Priorities:

In 2004, management is focused on the following key objectives:

1.

Continue to divest non-strategic businesses:

The Company expects to
complete the majority of its divestitures in 2004. As discussed above,
the Company has made significant progress in 2003 by divesting the
Cosmolab cosmetics business and the German picture frames business. This
progress continued in the first quarter of 2004 by announcing the
divestiture of the Panex Brazilian cookware business and the remainder of
its European picture frames business. The divestitures of these
businesses and others currently being evaluated for potential divestiture
are expected to reduce 2004 earnings per share by approximately $0.11 to
$0.13, exclusive of the loss to be recognized in 2004. In addition,
operating cash flow is expected to be reduced by $40 to $45 million,
annually.

2.

Complete the 2001 restructuring plan:

The Company plans to
substantially complete the 2001 restructuring program in 2004 and expects
to recognize approximately $43 to $63 million in 2004 charges.

3.

Continue to rationalize low-margin product lines:

The Company will
continue to rationalize low-margin product lines in 2004. The completion
of this program is expected to reduce annual sales by approximately $300
million.

4.

Deploy Newell Operational Excellence:

The Company is committed to
reducing the costs by at least 5% annually. In connection with this
goal, the Company is committed to deploying and implementing NWL OPEX,
which is a methodical process focused on lean manufacturing. It includes
installing the right manufacturing and distribution metrics and driving
improvement quarter after quarter. In addition to cost reduction, other
key components of NWL OPEX are improved quality and service levels and
the reduction of inventory and lead times.

Results of Operations — 2003 vs. 2002

Net sales increased $296.1 million, or 4.0%, in 2003. The increase in sales
is primarily related to sales from recently acquired businesses of
approximately $339.2 million, partially offset by a decrease of $39.9 million
in sales from divested businesses, and favorable foreign currency of $231.1
million, partially offset by negative pricing of $140.8 million and the exit
of high-risk accounts of $165.3 million.

Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, in 2003 was 26.7%, or $2,067.2
million, versus 27.6%, or $2,059.7 million in 2002. The reduction in gross
margin is primarily related to unfavorable pricing of 1.9%, or 1.3 points,
offset by net productivity of 1.6%. Increased resin costs of $75 million
negatively impacted gross margins and are included as a reduction of our
productivity. The favorable impact of the Lenox acquisition (+0.7 points) was
more than offset by unfavorable mix in the remainder of our businesses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were 17.5% of net sales
in both 2003 and 2002. The $45.6 million increase in SG&A primarily related to
recently acquired businesses of approximately $84.8 million. All other SG&A
was down by $39.2 million with streamlining initiatives of $128 million more
than offsetting increases from currency translation, pension and strategic
investments.

The Company continues to assess opportunities to divest or exit non-strategic
businesses and low margin product lines. During the fourth quarter of 2003,
the Company recorded an impairment charge of $289.4 million associated with
these businesses and the exit of certain product lines. Refer to Note 14 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax strategic restructuring charges of $245.0
million ($165.7 million after taxes) and $122.7 million ($81.6 million after
tax) in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2003 pre-tax charge included $118.5
million of facility and other exit costs, $103.3 million of employee severance
and termination benefits, and $23.2 million in other restructuring costs. The
2002 pre-tax charge included $36.6 million of facility and other exit costs,
$76.3 million of employee severance and termination benefits, and $9.8 million
in other restructuring costs. Refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on the strategic restructuring plan.

Operating income in 2003 was 2.3% of net sales, or $179.9 million, versus
operating income of 8.4%, or $629.7 million in 2002. The decrease in
operating margins is primarily the result of increased restructuring charges
incurred to streamline the Company’s supply chain and the impairment charge
related to businesses for which the Company has begun to explore strategic
alternatives, including potential divestiture.

Net income before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting change
in 2003 was $20.1 million, a $448.4 million decrease from $468.5 million in
2002. The decrease relates primarily to the increased restructuring costs and
the impairment charge noted above.

The effective tax rate was 331.9% for the year ended 2003 versus 33.5% in the
prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily related to the
non-deductibility of the write-off of goodwill associated with the Company’s
$289.4 million impairment charge. Refer to Notes 13 and 14 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information.



Net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change in 2003 was $46.6
million, a $358.1 million decrease from net income before cumulative effect of
accounting change of $311.5 million in 2002. Diluted loss per share before
cumulative effect of accounting change was $0.17 in 2003 compared to earnings
of $1.16 in 2002.

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the required impairment
tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which resulted in an
impairment charge of $514.9 million, net of tax. See Footnote 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Net loss for 2003 was $46.6 million compared to a net loss of $203.4 million in
2002. Basic and diluted loss per share in 2003 decreased to a loss of $0.17
versus a loss of $0.76 in 2002. The decrease in net loss and loss per share was
primarily due to the lack of any cumulative effect of accounting changes
related to goodwill, offset by additional restructuring charges to streamline
the Company’s supply chain, and the impairment charges related to non-strategic
businesses that the Company is considering for possible divestiture. See
Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details
related to cumulative effect of accounting change charge for goodwill.

Results of Operations — 2002 vs. 2001

Net sales increased
$544.6 million, or 7.9%, in 2002. The increase in sales is
primarily related to sales from Irwin of $318.3 million
(acquired April 2002) and increased sales of core products of 3.3%.

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales in 2002 was 27.6%, or $2,059.7
million, versus 27.0%, or $1,862.7 million, in 2001. The improvement in gross
margin was primarily related to the implementation of a productivity initiative
throughout the Company and higher margins from our new products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 were 17.5% of net sales,
or $1,307.3 million, versus 16.9%, or $1,168.2 million, in 2001. The increase
in SG&A is a result of the Irwin acquisition ($75.5 million) and
planned investments in marketing initiatives, including the Company’s
Strategic Account Management Program, television advertising program and
Phoenix Program, supporting the Company’s brand portfolio and strategic
account management strategy.

During 2002, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $122.7
million associated with the Company’s strategic restructuring plan. The 2002
pre-tax charge included $36.6 million of facility and other exit costs, $76.3
million of employee severance and termination benefits, and $9.8 million in
other restructuring costs. The 2001 pre-tax charge included $34.6 million of
facility and other exit costs, $28.5 million of employee severance and
termination benefits, and $3.6 million in other restructuring costs. Refer to
Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the
strategic restructuring plan.

Operating income in 2002 was 8.4% of net sales, or $629.7 million, versus 8.3%
of net sales, or $570.9 million, in 2001. The increase in operating margins
was primarily due to improvement in gross margin and the elimination of
amortization expense associated with goodwill (see Footnote 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion) offset by planned
investment in marketing initiatives supporting the Company’s brand portfolio
and strategic account management strategy and restructuring charges to
streamline the Company’s supply chain.

Net nonoperating expenses in 2002 were 2.2% of net sales, or $161.2 million,
versus 2.2%, or $155.0 million, in 2001. The increase in net nonoperating
expense primarily related to the Anchor Hocking withdrawn divestiture cost of
$13.6 million ($9.1 million after tax) in 2002. These costs were partially
offset by lower interest rates. See Footnote 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional details.

The effective tax rate was 33.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus
36.4% in the prior year. The decrease in the tax rate primarily related to
the change in accounting relating to goodwill and tradename amortization.
See Footnotes 1 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an
explanation of accounting change related to the effective tax rate.



Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change in 2002 was $311.5
million, a $46.9 million, or 17.7% increase from $264.6 million in 2001.
Diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of accounting change was
$1.16 in 2002 compared to $0.99 in 2001.

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the required impairment
tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which resulted in an
impairment charge of $514.9 million, net of tax. See Footnote 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Net loss for 2002 was $203.4 million compared to net income of $264.6 million
in 2001. Basic and diluted loss/earnings per share in 2002 decreased to a loss
of $0.76 versus income of $0.99 in 2001. The decrease in net income and
earnings per share in 2002 was primarily due to the cumulative effect of
accounting changes related to goodwill, and increased restructuring charges to
streamline the Company’s supply chain, partially offset by an improvement in
gross margins, the elimination of amortization expense associated with
goodwill, lower interest rates and a reduction in income tax expense. See
Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details
related to cumulative effect of accounting change charge for goodwill.

Cleaning and Organization

Net sales for 2003 were $2,013.7 million, an increase of $111.9 million, or
5.9%, from $1,901.8 million in 2002. The 5.9% sales growth was primarily due
to mid single-digit sales growth at the Rubbermaid Home Products division. The
primary reason for the overall sales increase was continued growth in sales of
newer products such



as the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs®, the Tool Tower™, the Sports Station™, the
Endurance Cooler™ and other product offerings, partially offset by price
reductions.

Operating income for 2002 was $92.0 million, a decrease of $77.0 million, or
45.6%, from $169.0 million in 2002. The decrease in operating income is
primarily the result of higher raw material costs (primarily resin) and pricing
pressure on non-differentiated items in its Rubbermaid Home Products business.

Office Products

Net sales for 2003 were $1,681.2 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 0.2%,
from $1,684.1 million in 2002. The slight decrease in net sales primarily
resulted from continued softness in the commercial sector.

Operating income for 2003 was $309.6 million, an increase of $3.5 million, or
1.1%, from $306.1 million in 2002. Operating income was positively impacted by
productivity and favorable mix management, partially offset by increased
investments in marketing initiatives.

Home Fashions

Net sales for 2003 were $1,258.7 million, a decrease of $166.8 million, or
11.7%, from $1,425.5 million in 2002. The decrease in net sales was primarily
attributable to a double-digit decrease at the Burnes picture frames business,
which primarily resulted from the Company’s planned exit from certain high-risk
customers and pricing pressure on opening price point products. The planned
exit of low margin product lines in the Levolor/Kirsch business also
contributed to the decrease in sales.

Operating income for 2003 was $54.9 million, a decrease of $58.6 million, or
51.6%, from $113.5 million in 2002. The decrease in operating income is
primarily due to the sales decline noted previously and pricing pressure on
opening price point items.

Tools and Hardware

Net sales for 2003 were $1,199.7 million, an increase of $416.7 million, or
53.2%, from $783.0 million in 2002. The increase in net sales is primarily due
to incremental sales resulting from the Lenox and Irwin acquisitions,
as well as strong sales in the Irwin North America division driven by new products, most
notably the success of the Strait-Line products.

Operating income for 2002 was $179.2 million, an increase of $100.0 million, or
126.3%, from $79.2 million in 2002. The improvement in operating income was
driven by strong productivity, new products and the acquisitions of Lenox and
Irwin.

Other

Net sales for 2003 were $1,596.7 million, a decrease of $62.8 million, or 3.8%,
from $1,659.5 million in 2002. The decrease in sales resulted primarily from
the disposition of Cosmolab in March 2003 as well as a mid single-digit
decrease in net sales in the low-end cookware business, primarily as a result
of negative pricing and unfavorable mix.

Operating income for 2002 was $108.9 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or
5.9%, from $115.7 million in 2002. The main driver of this decrease in
operating income was the decrease in sales caused by pricing pressures and
unfavorable mix in the low-end cookware business.

Cleaning and Organization

Net sales for 2002 were $1,901.8 million, an increase of $82.7 million, or
4.5%, from $1,819.1 million in 2001. The 4.5% sales growth was primarily due
to mid-single digit sales growth at the Rubbermaid Home Products division. The
primary reasons for the overall sales increase were sales gains at strategic
accounts and new product introductions, such as the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs®, the
Slim Cooler™, Stain Shield™, and the Tool Tower™ and growth in existing
products, partially offset by product price reductions.

Operating income for 2002 was $169.0 million, an increase of $9.2 million, or
5.8%, from $159.8 million in 2001. The increase is primarily related to
productivity improvements and increased margin for new products, partially
offset by product price reductions and continued investments in divisional
growth initiatives, including costs related to new product development and
product launches, primarily television advertising for featured items such as
the Slim Cooler™ and the Tool Tower™.

Office Products

Net sales for 2002 were $1,684.1 million, an increase of $75.3 million, or
4.7%, from $1,608.8 million in 2001. The primary reasons for the increase
were sales gains at strategic accounts, new product introductions (including
the Sharpie® Chisel Tip and Liquid Paper® Backtracker™), and growth in existing
Paper Mate® pens, Sharpie® permanent markers and Colorific® product lines.

Operating income for 2002 was $306.1 million, an increase of $37.4 million, or
13.9%, from $268.7 million in 2001. The increase is primarily related to sales
growth, productivity improvements and increased margin from new products,
partially offset by continued investments in divisional growth initiatives,
primarily television advertising for the Sharpie® and Paper Mate® brands.

Home Fashions

Net sales for 2002 were $1,425.5 million, a decrease of $9.7 million, or 0.7%,
from $1,435.2 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily driven by a low
single-digit decrease in net sales of the Levolor/Kirsch division caused by the
planned exit of low margin products.



Operating income for 2002 was $113.5 million, a decrease of $6.8 million, or
5.7%, from $120.3 million in 2001. The primary driver in the decrease in
operating income was the decrease in net sales at the Levolor/Kirsch division
caused by the planned exit of low margin products.

Tools and Hardware

Net sales for 2002 were $783.0 million, an increase of $350.4 million, or
81.0%, from $432.6 million in 2001. The increase in sales is primarily related
to sales from Irwin of $318.3 million and double-digit sales growth at
the BernzOmatic division.

Operating income for 2002 was $79.2 million, an increase of $11.5 million, or
17.0%, from $67.7 million in 2001. The increase in operating income was
primarily due to increased sales and cost savings from productivity
initiatives, partially offset by product price reductions, continued investment
in sales and marketing growth initiatives, and start-up costs related to the
Irwin acquisition.

Other

Net sales for 2002 were $1,659.5 million, an increase of $45.9 million, or
2.8%, from $1,613.6 million in 2001. Sales growth related primarily to
Calphalon and Cookware Europe divisions related to new product introductions
and existing product sales at strategic accounts, partially offset by a
double-digit sales decline at Graco.

Operating income for 2002 was $115.7 million, an increase of $10.2 million, or
9.7%, from $105.5 million in 2001. The increase in operating income was due
primarily to cost savings from productivity initiatives and sales growth from
new and existing products, partially offset by product price reductions and
costs related to marketing growth initiatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources include cash
provided by operations and use of available borrowing facilities.

Cash provided from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003
was $773.2 million compared to $868.9 million for the comparable period of
2002. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities was due to a
decrease in earnings before non-cash charges of $29.0 million
(as shown in the following table) and a reduction
in the year-over-year improvement in working capital and other assets in 2003
vs. 2002, which used an additional $74.2 million, partially
offset by an increase in deferred
gains relating to the early termination of certain interest rate swap
arrangements. The deferred gain from these swap agreements was $28.3 million
in 2003 compared to $20.8 million in 2002 and were included in Other
in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

In 2003, the Company completed the sale of its Cosmolab cosmetic and the
German picture frames businesses. The Company received cash proceeds of $10.2
million related to these transactions. The Company used the proceeds from the
sale to reduce its commercial paper borrowings. Cosmolab was included in the
results of the Company’s Other segment and the German Frames business was
included in the Home Fashions segment.



In 2003, the Company generated $33.7 million of cash related to the sale of
idle assets, a $25.9 million increase over 2002. The Company does not
anticipate significant cash flow from the sale of idle assets in 2004.

In 2003, the Company received proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,044.0
million compared to $772.0 million in 2002.

On January 10, 2003, the Company completed the sale of 6.67 million shares of
its common stock at a public offering price of $30.10 per share pursuant to a
shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Total proceeds from the sale were approximately $200.8 million,
resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after expenses, of $200.1 million.
The proceeds were used to reduce the Company’s commercial paper borrowings.

The Company has a $1.05 billion universal shelf registration statement that
became effective in April 2003 under which debt and equity securities may be
issued. In 2003, $400.0 million of medium term notes were issued under this
shelf registration statement, the proceeds of which were used to pay down
commercial paper.

The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit
with various banks that are available for short-term financing. Borrowings
under the Company’s uncommitted lines of credit are subject to the discretion
of the lender. The Company’s lines of credit do not have a material impact on
the Company’s liquidity. Borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit at
December 31, 2003 totaled $21.9 million.

The Company completed a $1,300.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility
(the “Revolver”) on June 14, 2002. The Revolver consists of a $650.0 million
364-day credit agreement and a $650.0 million five-year credit agreement. On
June 13, 2003, the Company rolled over the 364-day credit agreement. At
December 31, 2003, there were no borrowings under the Revolver.

In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue up to $1,300.0
million of commercial paper. The Revolver provides the committed backup
liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper
may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the
Revolver. At December 31, 2003, $217.1 million (principal amount) of
commercial paper was outstanding. Because $650.0 million of the Revolver
expires in June 2007, the entire $217.1 million is classified as long-term
debt.

The Revolver permits the Company to borrow funds on a variety of interest rate
terms. The Revolver requires, among other things, that the Company maintain
certain Interest Coverage and Total Indebtedness to Total Capital Ratio, as
defined in the agreement. The agreement also limits Subsidiary Indebtedness.
As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with this agreement.

Under a 2001 receivables facility with a financial institution, the Company
created a financing entity that is consolidated in the Company’s financial
statements. Under this facility, the Company regularly enters into
transactions with the financing entity to sell an undivided interest in
substantially all of the Company’s United States trade receivables to the
financing entity. In 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in
preferred debt securities to the financial institution. Those preferred debt
securities must be retired or redeemed before the Company can have access to
the financing entity’s receivables. Also, certain levels of accounts receivable write-offs and other events would permit the financial institution to terminate the receivables lending commitment and
require redemption of the preferred debt securities. The receivables and the $450.0 million
preferred debt securities are recorded in the consolidated accounts of the
Company. Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to
be long-term debt. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the aggregate amount of
outstanding receivables sold under the agreement was $777.4 million and $738.2
million, respectively.

Uses

The Company’s primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include
acquisitions, payments on long-term debt, dividend payments and capital
expenditures.

Cash used for acquisitions was $460.0 million in 2003, compared to $242.2
million in 2002. The increase in cash used for acquisitions related primarily
to the acquisition of Lenox, which was funded through the issuance of
commercial paper.



Capital expenditures were $300.0 million and $252.1 million in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to the
acquisitions of Irwin and Lenox and the Company’s increased investment
in new product development and productivity initiatives.

In 2003, the Company made payments on long-term debt of $989.6 million
compared to $901.5 million in 2002.

Aggregate dividends paid were $230.9 million and $224.4 million in 2003 and
2002, respectively. The increase primarily relates to the additional shares
issued on January 10, 2003.

Cash used for restructuring activities was $106.4 million and $58.0 million in
2003 and 2002, respectively. The cash payments primarily relate to employee
termination benefits.

Working capital at December 31, 2003 was $978.2 million compared to $465.6
million at December 31, 2002. The current ratio at December 31, 2003 was
1.48:1 compared to 1.18:1 at December 31, 2002. The increase in working
capital and the current ratio is due to the Irwin and Lenox
acquisitions, and a reduction in the current portion of long-term debt.

Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash
equivalents, and total capitalization includes total debt and stockholders’
equity) was .58:1 at December 31, 2003 and .57:1 at December 31, 2002.

The Company believes that cash provided from operations and available
borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the cash
needs of existing businesses on a short-term basis; however, certain events,
such as significant acquisitions, could require additional external financing
on a long-term basis.

Minimum Pension Liability

The decline in U.S. and European interest rates since the prior measurement
date has caused the Company to change the discount rate used to calculate the
present value of its pension liabilities from 6.48% at December 31, 2002 to an
estimated 6.14% at December 31, 2003, increasing the Company’s pension plan
liability. As a result, the Company’s pension plan, which historically has had
an over-funded position, currently is under-funded. In accordance with the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded an additional minimum pension
liability adjustment at December 31, 2003. Based on plan asset values at the
measurement date, the approximate effect of this non-cash adjustment was to
increase the pension liability by $170.0 million, with a corresponding charge
to equity, net of taxes, of $114.5 million. The direct charge to stockholders’
equity did not affect net income, but is included in other comprehensive
income. The Company remains confident that its pension plan has the
appropriate long-term investment strategy and the Company’s liquidity position
is expected to remain strong.

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has various contractual obligations which are appropriately
recorded as liabilities in its consolidated financial statements. Certain
other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are
not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized
as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are
commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been
received as of December 31, 2003 and future minimum lease payments for the use
of property and equipment under operating lease agreements.

The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material
contractual obligations listed below are expected to have on the Company’s
cash flow in the indicated period. In addition, the table reflects the timing
of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December
31, 2003. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the
footnotes to the financial statements, as referenced in the table (in

The Company also has obligations with respect to its pension and post
retirement medical benefit plans. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had $131.0 million in standby letters of
credit primarily related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including
workers’ compensation, product liability, and medical. Refer to Note 17 in
the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company did not have any significant off-balance
sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Footnote 1, the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot
be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of
estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will
differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the
Company’s critical accounting policies.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite Life Intangible Assets

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but remain subject to
periodic impairment tests in accordance with the statements.

The Company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite
life intangible assets in the third quarter. The Company also tests for
impairment if events or circumstances occur subsequent to the Company’s annual
impairment tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company cannot predict the
occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of
goodwill. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic
decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact
of the economic environment on the Company’s customer base, or a material
negative change in its relationships with significant customers. In
conducting this impairment test, the Company estimates the future cash flows
of its businesses to which the goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles
relate. These cash flows are then discounted at rates ranging from 9% to 13%,
reflecting the respective specific industry’s cost of capital. The discounted
cash flows are then compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit to
determine if impairment exists. If, upon review, the fair value is less than
the carrying value of the reporting unit, the carrying value is written down
to estimated fair value. Reporting units are



typically operating segments or operations one level below operating segments
for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment
management regularly reviews the operating results. Because there usually is
a lack of quoted market prices for the reporting units, the fair value usually
is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount
rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected
future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value
calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes,
prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review.

As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill
impairment charge of $538.0 million in the first quarter of 2002 (with an
after-tax charge totaling $514.9 million).

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company began exploring various options for
certain businesses in the Home Fashions and Other segments, including
evaluating those businesses for potential sale. As this process progressed,
the Company obtained a better indication of the market value of these
businesses and determined that the businesses had a net book value in excess of
their fair value. As a result, the Company conducted a new impairment test in
the fourth quarter and recorded an impairment loss of $242.0 million related to
goodwill to write the net assets of these businesses to fair value.

The accounting estimate related to goodwill and other indefinite life
intangible assets is highly susceptible to change from period to period
because it requires management to make estimates of future cash flows and
changes in cost of capital related to each of its business units. There is
potential for economic, regulatory, or other conditions that could adversely
affect the ability of each business unit to generate future cash flows.
Should these conditions deteriorate, there is the potential for additional
impairment losses to be incurred, and such losses could be material to the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Legal and Environmental Reserves

As described in Footnote 17 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary
course of its business. These proceedings include claims for damages arising
out of use of the Company’s products, allegations of infringement of
intellectual property, commercial disputes and employment matters as well as
environmental matters. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for
punitive as well as compensatory damages, and a few proceedings purport to be
class actions.

In determining the appropriate level of legal reserves, the Company evaluates
the potential exposure on specific claims. The Company evaluates the range of
estimated loss for each specific case and determines the probable exposure
based largely on historical experience. While the Company believes it is
adequately reserved for legal exposures, management cannot predict with
certainty the ultimate outcome of these cases, including any amounts it may be
required to pay in excess of amounts reserved. The ultimate outcome of these
cases could exceed the amounts recorded and such losses could be material to
the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company is involved in various matters concerning federal and state
environmental laws and regulations, including matters in which the Company has
been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain state
environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) at
contaminated sites under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and equivalent state laws.

In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has considered
several factors, including: the extent of the Company’s volumetric
contribution at each site relative to that of other PRPs; the kind of waste;
the terms of existing cost sharing and other applicable agreements; the
financial ability of other PRPs to share in the payment of requisite costs;
the Company’s prior experience with similar sites; environmental studies and
cost estimates available to the Company; the effects of inflation on cost
estimates; and the extent to which the Company’s and other parties’ status as
PRPs is disputed.

The Company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these
matters as of December 31, 2003 ranged between $14.5 million and $19.9
million. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had a reserve equal to $17.8
million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate. No insurance
recovery was taken into



account in determining the Company’s cost estimates or reserve, nor do the
Company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value
purposes, except with respect to two long-term (30 year) operations and
maintenance CERCLA matters which are estimated at present value.

Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and
response activities, the possibility that the Company could be identified as a
PRP at sites identified in the future that require the incurrence of
environmental response costs and the possibility of additional sites as a
result of businesses acquired, actual costs to be incurred by the Company may
vary from the Company’s estimates. The ultimate outcome of these matters may
exceed the amounts recorded by the Company and such additional losses may be
material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Product Liability Reserves

The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that includes
reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk
transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with
actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the
application of risk transfer programs in determining required product
liability reserves. As a result of the most recent analysis, the Company has
estimated these reserves at $27.9 million. The Company’s actuarial evaluation
methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining
the Company’s product liability reserve. While the Company believes that it
has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these
matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company and such additional
losses may be material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recovery of Accounts Receivable

The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a
combination of factors. When aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet
its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or
deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, the
Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related
receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The
Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a
variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due
and historical collection experience. If circumstances related to specific
customers change, the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables
could be further adjusted.

Inventory Reserves

The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving
inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory
and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and
market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those
projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenues and freight billed to customers, net of
provisions for cash discounts, returns, volume or trade customer discounts,
co-op advertising and other sales discounts, upon shipment to customers when
all substantial risks of ownership change. In accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force (“EITF”) No. 00-10, “Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and
Costs,” the Company records amounts billed to customers related to shipping
and handling as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and handling as
a cost of products sold. See Footnote 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Refer to Footnote 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.



International Operations

The Company’s non-U.S. business increased 12.3% in 2003 and 7.0% in 2002. In
2003, the increase primarily related to foreign currency movement, primarily
in Europe. In 2002, the increase was fueled by recent international
acquisitions, primarily in Europe. For the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, the Company’s non-U.S. business accounted for approximately
29%, 27% and 27% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements). Growth of both U.S. and non-U.S.
businesses is shown below for the years ended December 31,

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

The Company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. Pursuant to the
Company’s policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative financial
instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in market
prices. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading
purposes.

The Company’s primary market risks are foreign exchange and interest rate
exposure.

The Company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio
target and its mix of fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate swaps may be
used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market
conditions, and, for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is
included in interest expense.

The Company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging
anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of
one-year duration or less. The Company focuses on natural hedging techniques
of the following form:

•

offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows,

•

structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate
levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary
cash flows subject to conversion risk,

•

converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S. dollars or the relevant functional currency and

•

avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency.



In addition, the Company utilizes short-term forward contracts to hedge
commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and losses related to
qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and
included in the basis of the underlying transactions. Derivatives used to
hedge intercompany loans are marked to market with the corresponding gains or
losses included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company purchases certain raw materials that are subject to price
volatility caused by unpredictable factors. While future movements of raw
material costs are uncertain, a variety of programs, including periodic raw
material purchases, purchases of raw materials for future delivery and
customer price adjustments help the Company address this risk. Generally, the
Company does not use derivatives to manage the volatility related to this
risk.

The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that
the Company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or
foreign exchange rates using the value-at-risk estimation model. The
value-at-risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates
to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods.
It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques
and including substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding
equity-method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table below do
not have an impact on current results of operations or financial condition,
but are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in
interest rates. The following table indicates the calculated amounts for each
of the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002

The 95% confidence interval signifies the Company's degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above. The amounts
shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency
exchange rates could move in the Company’s favor. The value-at-risk model
assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse. Actual experience
has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is
highly unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over an
extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered projections of
future losses, because actual results may differ significantly depending upon
activity in the global financial markets.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The management of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. is responsible for the accuracy and
internal consistency of all information contained in this annual report,
including the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has followed those
generally accepted accounting principles that it believes to be most
appropriate to the circumstances of the Company, and has made what it believes
to be reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates where necessary.

Newell Rubbermaid Inc. operates under a system of internal accounting controls
designed to provide reasonable assurance that its financial records are
accurate, that the assets of the Company are protected and that the financial
statements fairly present the financial position and results of operations of
the Company. The internal accounting
control system is tested, monitored and revised as necessary.

Five directors of the Company, not members of management, serve as the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors and are the principal means through which
the Board oversees the performance of the financial reporting duties of
management. The Audit Committee meets with management and the Company’s
independent auditors several times a year to review the results of the external
audit of the Company and to discuss plans for future



audits. At these meetings, the Audit Committee also meets privately with the
independent auditors to assure its free access to them.

The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst and Young LLP, audited the financial
statements prepared by the management of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. Their opinion
on these statements is presented below.

The Company’s prior independent accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP, was convicted
on June 15, 2002 of one count of obstruction of justice arising from the
government’s investigation of Enron Corporation. Events arising out of the
conviction of Arthur Andersen LLP, as well as the volume of civil lawsuits
against it, have adversely affected the ability of Arthur Andersen LLP to
satisfy claims, if any, arising from its providing of auditing services to the
Company, including claims that may arise out of Arthur Andersen LLP’s audit of
the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2001 and for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001, which are included
in this Report. A copy of a report previously issued by Arthur Andersen LLP in
connection with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2001 is presented below. Arthur Andersen LLP has not reissued
this opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Newell Rubbermaid Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newell
Rubbermaid Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash
flows for the years then ended. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits. The financial statements and schedule of Newell
Rubbermaid Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2001 were audited by other
auditors who have ceased operations and whose report dated January 25, 2002
expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements before the disclosure and
restatement adjustments described in Notes 1 and 16, respectively.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 2003 and 2002 financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Also, in our opinion, the related 2003 and 2002 financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets to conform with FASB Statement No. 142. As described
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and as permitted by FASB
Interpretation No. 46, in 2003, the Company changed its method of accounting
for the Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Securities effective January 1, 2002.

As discussed above, the financial statements of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. for the
year ended December 31, 2001, were audited by other auditors who have ceased
operations. As described in Note 1, these financial statements have been
revised to include the transitional disclosures required by FASB Statement No.
142, which was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. Our audit
procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note 1 with respect to 2001
included (a) agreeing the previously reported net income to the previously
issued financial statements and the adjustments to reported net income
representing amortization expense (including any related tax effects)
recognized in those periods related to goodwill to the Company’s underlying
records obtained from management, and (b) testing the mathematical accuracy of
the reconciliation of adjusted net income to reported net income, and the
related earnings-per-share amounts. Also, as described in Note 16, the Company
changed the composition of its reportable segments in 2003, and the amounts in
the 2001 financial statements relating to reportable segments have been
restated to conform to the current composition of reportable segments. We
audited the adjustments that were applied to restate the disclosures for
reportable segments reflected in the 2001 financial statements. Our procedures
included (a) agreeing the adjusted amounts of segment revenues, operating
income and assets to the Company’s underlying records obtained from management,
and (b) testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliations of segment
amounts to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, such
adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were
not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 financial
statements of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and
adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of
assurance on the 2001 financial statements taken as a whole.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newell
Rubbermaid Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999 and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements and
the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of Newell Rubbermaid
Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
Consolidated Financial Statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in Part IV Item
14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K is presented for the purposes of complying with the
Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

FOOTNOTE 1

Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business:

Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (the “Company”) is a global
manufacturer and full-service marketer of name-brand consumer products serving
the needs of volume purchasers, including discount stores and warehouse clubs,
home centers and hardware stores, and office superstores and contract
stationers. The Company’s basic business strategy is to merchandise a
multi-product offering of everyday consumer products, backed by an obsession
with customer service excellence and new product development, in order to
achieve maximum results for its stockholders. The Company’s multi-product
offering consists of name-brand consumer products in five business segments:
Cleaning & Organization; Office Products; Home Fashions; Tools & Hardware; and
Other.

Principles of Consolidation

: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries, after elimination
of intercompany transactions.

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of these financial statements require the
use of certain estimates by management in determining the Company’s assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

: Certain 2002 and 2001 amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the 2003 presentation.

Concentration of Credit Risk:

The Company sells products to customers in
diversified industries and geographic regions and, therefore, has no
significant concentrations of credit risk. The Company continuously evaluates
the creditworthiness of its customers and generally does not require
collateral.

The Company’s interest rate swaps, short-term forward exchange contracts, and
long-term cross currency interest rate swaps do not subject the Company to
risk due to foreign exchange rate movement, because gains and losses on these
instruments generally offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and
other transactions being hedged. The Company is also exposed to
credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to
certain derivative financial instruments. The Company does not obtain
collateral or other security to support derivative financial instruments
subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the
counterparties.

Revenue Recognition

: Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers,
net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as
volume or trade discounts), co-op advertising and other sales related
discounts, are generally recognized upon shipment to customers and when all
substantial risks of ownership change. The Company records amounts billed to
customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and all expenses
related to shipping and handling as a cost of products sold.

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

: The Company’s
financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
notes payable, short and long-term debt. The fair value of these instruments
approximates carrying values due to their short-term duration, except as
follows:

Qualifying Derivative Instruments: The net fair value of the Company’s
qualifying derivative instruments is recorded in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and is described in more detail in Footnote 7.

Long-term Debt: The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt issued under
the medium-term note program was $1,756.6 million at December 31, 2003, based
on quoted market prices. All other significant long-term debt is pursuant to
floating rate instruments whose carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

: Cash and highly liquid short-term investments have
a maturity of three months or less.

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

: Accounts receivable are recorded at net
realizable value. Allowances for doubtful accounts at December 31 totaled
$63.8 million in 2003 and $75.0 million in 2002. On a regular basis, the
Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes the allowance for
doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances,
including credit conditions and based on a history of write-offs and
collections. A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been
received within the agreed upon invoice terms.



Inventories

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost
of certain domestic inventories (approximately 66% and 62% of total
inventories at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively) was determined by the
“last-in, first-out” (“LIFO”) method; for the balance, cost was determined
using the “first-in, first-out” (“FIFO”) method. If the FIFO inventory
valuation method had been used exclusively, inventories would have increased
by $0.3 million and $14.2 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
In 2003, the loss realized as a result of inventory liquidation was $3.9
million. The components of net inventories were as follows as of December 31,
(

$

$

Derivative Financial Instruments

: Effective January 1, 2001, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”, as amended. This statement requires companies to record
derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair
value. Any changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in the
income statement or other comprehensive income. The impact of adopting SFAS
No. 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in a cumulative after-tax gain of
approximately $13.0 million, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 133 did not materially
impact the results of operations.

Derivative financial instruments are used only to manage certain commodity,
interest rate and foreign currency risks. These instruments include commodity
swaps, interest rate swaps, long-term cross currency interest rate swaps, and
forward exchange contracts. The Company’s forward exchange contracts and
long-term cross currency interest rate swaps do not subject the Company to
risk due to foreign exchange rate movement, because gains and losses on these
instruments generally offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities, and
other transactions being hedged.

On the date in which the Company enters into a derivative, the derivative is
designated as a hedge of the identified exposure. The Company measures
effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at hedge inception and on an
ongoing basis.

Interest Rate Risk Management:

Gains and losses on interest rate swaps
designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent that the hedge relationship has
been effective, are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized in
interest expense over the period in which the Company recognizes interest
expense on the related debt instrument. Any ineffectiveness on these
instruments is immediately recognized in interest expense in the period that
the ineffectiveness occurs.

The Company also has designated certain interest rate swaps as fair value
hedges. The Company has structured all existing interest rate swap agreements
to be 100% effective. These fair value hedges qualify for the “shortcut
method.” As a result, there is no current impact to earnings resulting from
hedge ineffectiveness. Gains or losses resulting from the early termination of
interest rate swaps are deferred as an increase or decrease to the carrying
value of the related debt and amortized as an adjustment to the yield of the
related debt instrument over the remaining period originally covered by the
swap. The cash received relating to the termination of interest rate swaps is
included in Other as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows.

Foreign Currency Management:

The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts
to manage foreign exchange risk related to both known and anticipated
intercompany transactions and third-party commercial transaction exposures of
approximately one year in duration or less. The Company also utilizes
long-term cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge long-term intercompany
transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange
contracts, which hedge intercompany transactions or third-party commercial
transactions, are deferred in other comprehensive income with a corresponding
asset or liability until the underlying transaction occurs and are considered
to have a cash flow hedging relationship. The earnings impact of cash flow
hedges relating to forecasted purchases of inventory is generally reported in
cost of products sold to match the underlying transaction being hedged. For
hedged forecasted transactions,



hedge accounting is discontinued if the forecasted transaction is no longer
probable of occurring, in which case previously deferred hedging gains or
losses would be recorded to earnings immediately. The gains and losses
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to
earnings upon completion of the underlying transaction being hedged.

Derivative instruments used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to market
with the corresponding gains or losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income and are considered to have a fair value hedging
relationship. Any ineffectiveness associated with the fair value hedges is
classified to the income statement.

Property, Plant and Equipment

: Property, plant, and equipment are stated at
cost. Replacements and improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense. Depreciation expense is
calculated principally on the straight-line basis. Maximum useful lives
determined by the Company are: buildings and improvements (20-40 years) and
machinery and equipment (3-12 years). Property, plant and equipment consisted
of the following as of December 31, (

respectively. As of December 31, 2002, the Company accrued $26.1 million for
equipment received but not paid for. This amount has been excluded from the
following line items: expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the
change in accounts payable in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Goodwill and Trade Names

: Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized, but are subject
to periodic impairment tests. Other intangible assets continue to be
amortized over their useful lives.

Pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, all amortization expense on trade
names and goodwill ceased on January 1, 2002. The Company recognized goodwill
amortization of $56.9 million in 2001. Net income for the year ended December
31, 2001, excluding goodwill amortization, would have been $318.1 million,
while basic and diluted EPS would have been $1.19 per share.

The Company conducts its annual test of impairment for goodwill and indefinite
life intangible assets in the third quarter. The Company also tests for
impairment if events or circumstances occur subsequent to the Company’s annual
impairment tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company cannot predict the
occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of
goodwill. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic
decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact
of the economic environment on the Company’s customer base, or a material
negative change in its relationships with significant customers.

As of January 1, 2002, the Company performed the required impairment tests of
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and recorded a pre-tax
goodwill impairment charge of $538.0 million in the first quarter of 2002
(with an after-tax charge totaling $514.9 million). In determining this
amount of goodwill impairment, the Company measured the impairment loss as the
excess of the carrying amount of goodwill (which included the carrying amount
of trademarks) over the implied fair value of goodwill (which excluded the
fair value of identifiable trademarks).

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company began exploring various options for
certain businesses in the Home Fashions and Other segments, including
evaluating those businesses for potential sale. As this process progressed,
the Company obtained a better indication of the market value of these
businesses and determined that the businesses had a net book



value in excess of their fair value. As a result, the Company conducted a new
impairment test in the fourth quarter and recorded an impairment loss of $242.0
million related to goodwill to write the net assets of these businesses to fair
value.

A summary of changes in the Company’s goodwill during the year ended December
31, 2003 is as follows

Intangible amortization expense was $6.7 million and $9.6 million in 2003 and
2002, respectively. Amortization expense per year is expected to be
consistent with the 2003 amounts over the next five years. However, such
amounts may vary based on movement in foreign currency rates, business
acquisitions or divestitures, or potential impairment losses.

Long-Lived Assets

: The Company periodically evaluates whether events and
circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life
of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of
long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If factors indicate that long-lived
assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an
estimate of the relevant businesses’ undiscounted net cash flow over the
remaining life of the long-lived assets in measuring whether the carrying
value is recoverable. An impairment loss would be measured by reducing the
carrying value to fair value, based on a discounted cash flow analysis.

Product Warranties:

In the normal course of business, the Company offers
warranties for a variety of its products. The specific terms and conditions
of the warranties vary depending upon the specific product and markets in
which the products were sold. The Company accrues for the estimated cost of
product warranty at the time of sale based on historical experience.

Foreign Currency Translation

: Foreign currency balance sheet accounts are
translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at fiscal year
end. The related translation adjustments are made directly to accumulated
other comprehensive income. Income and expenses are translated at the average
monthly rates of exchange in effect during the year. Gains and losses from
foreign currency transactions of these subsidiaries are included in net
income. International subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies
translate nonmonetary assets at historical rates, while net monetary assets
are translated at current rates, with the resulting translation adjustment
included in net income as other nonoperating expenses (income).

Advertising Costs

: The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred,
including cooperative advertising programs with customers. Total cooperative
advertising expense was $195.5 million, $218.6 million, and $196.8 million for
2003,



2002 and 2001, respectively. Cooperative advertising is recorded in the
Consolidated Financial Statements as a reduction of sales because it is viewed
as part of the negotiated price of products. All other advertising costs are
charged to selling, general and administrative expenses and totaled $142.5
million, $140.6 million, and $100.3 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively.

Research and Development Costs

: Research and development costs relating to
both future and present products are charged to selling, general and
administrative expenses as incurred. These costs aggregated $124.6 million,
$87.6 million, and $67.2 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Fair Value of Stock Options:

The Company’s stock option plans are accounted
for under APB Opinion No. 25. As a result, the Company grants fixed stock
options under which no compensation cost is recognized. Had compensation cost
for the plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net
income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro
forma amounts for the year ended December 31, (

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
146 (FAS 146), “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.” FAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities included in restructurings. This
Statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit
costs as defined in EITF Issue 94-3, and requires that liabilities for exit
activities be recognized when incurred instead of at the exit activity
commitment date. Additionally, FAS 146 requires recognition of one-time
severance benefits that require employees to render future service beyond a
minimum retention period over the future service period. The Company adopted
the provisions of FAS 146, effective January 1, 2003.



In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 150
(FAS 150), “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics
of both Liabilities and Equity.” FAS 150 establishes standards for how an
issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. On October 29, 2003 the FASB
deferred, indefinitely, the application of paragraphs 9 and 10 of FAS 150 as it
relates to mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated
subsidiaries that would not be recorded as liabilities under FAS 150 by such
subsidiaries. The adoption of the remainder of FAS 150 on July 1, 2003, had no
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial results.

Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted Interpretation 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46). FIN 46 was issued by
the FASB in January 2003 and introduces a new consolidation model — the
variable interests model — which determines consolidation based on potential
variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for
consolidation. FIN 46 initially applied to interests in variable interest
entities acquired before February 1, 2003. A FASB staff position issued in
October 2003 deferred the effective date of the Interpretation to the first
interim or annual period after December 15, 2003 for entities created before
February 1, 2003.

The Interpretation requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in
which a company absorbs a majority of another entity’s expected losses,
receives a majority of the other entity’s expected residual returns, or both,
as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the other
entity. These entities are called “variable interest entities” (VIEs). The
principal characteristics of variable interest entities are (1) an insufficient
amount of equity to absorb the entity’s expected losses without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties, (2) equity owners as a group
are not able to make decisions about the entity’s activities, or (3) the
holders of the equity at risk do not have the obligation to absorb the entity’s
losses or receive the entity’s residual returns. Variable interests are
contractual, ownership, or other interests in an entity that expose their
holders to the risks and rewards of the VIE. Variable interests therefore
include equity investments, loans, leases, derivatives, guarantees, and other
instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in the VIE’s assets.

If an entity is determined to be a VIE, the entity must be consolidated by the
“primary beneficiary”. The primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable
interests that absorbs a majority of the VIE’s expected losses, receives a
majority of the entity’s residual returns in the event, or both. There is no
primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the
expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns. The
determination of the primary beneficiary is based on projected cash flows at
the inception of the variable interests. The Company has variable interests in
the following types of variable interest entities:

The Company has a subsidiary trust that has Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities outstanding with a liquidation value of $500 million.
These securities were issued in December 1997 and were previously reported on
our balance sheet as Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary Trust. The trust is a VIE under FIN 46
because the Company has only a limited ability to make decisions about its
activities. However, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trust.
Therefore, the Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities of
$500.0 million issued by the trust are no longer reported on the Company’s
balance sheet. Instead, the Company reports the convertible Subordinated
Debentures held by the trust as long-term debt. These notes have previously
been eliminated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Distributions on the Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities
from January 1, 2002 are no longer reported on the Company’s statements of
operations, but interest on the notes is reported as interest expense. As
permitted by FIN 46, the Company is adopting FIN 46 as of January 1, 2002. As
a result, at that date, the Company deconsolidated the subsidiary trust.

The Company has an agreement with a financial institution creating a financing
entity that is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. Under the
agreement, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the financing
entity to sell an undivided interest in substantially all of the Company’s
United States trade receivables to the financing entity. This entity meets the
criteria for being a VIE because the voting rights and economic interests held
by the Company in it are disproportional to the Company’s obligations to absorb
expected losses or receive expected residual returns. The Company’s variable
interests in this entity include the receivables purchase and servicing
agreement, a loan back to the Company of essentially all excess cash, and
common stock. The Company’s assessment of expected losses and expected
residual returns indicates that it is the primary beneficiary of this
subsidiary, and accordingly, the Company continues to consolidate it.



In December 2003, FASB Statement No. 132 (FAS 132) (revised), “Employers’
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits”, was issued. FAS
132 (revised) prescribes employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans; it does not change the measurement or recognition
of those plans. The Statement retains and revises the disclosure requirements
contained in the original FAS 132. It also requires additional disclosures
about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of
defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The
Statement generally is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2003. The Company’s disclosures in Footnote 9 incorporate the requirement of
FAS 132 (revised).

FOOTNOTE 2

Acquisitions and Divestitures of Businesses

2003:

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of American
Saw & Mfg. Co. (“Lenox”), a leading manufacturer of power tool accessories and
hand tools marketed under the Lenox brand. The purchase price was
approximately $450 million paid for through the issuance of commercial paper,
plus transaction costs of $5.8 million. The transaction structure permits the
deduction of goodwill for tax purposes. We estimate the present value of the
future tax benefit to be $85 million. The Company has allocated the purchase price to the
identifiable assets. This acquisition and the acquisition of American Tool
Companies, Inc. (“Irwin”) in 2002 marked a significant expansion and
enhancement of the Company’s product lines and customer base, launching it
squarely into the estimated $10 billion-plus global markets for hand tools and
power tool accessories. Both of these acquisitions are reported in the
Company’s Tools and Hardware business segment. The purchase price for the
Lenox acquisition has been allocated to the fair market value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed.

The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation for Lenox:

The transaction summarized above and other minor acquisitions were accounted
for as purchases; therefore, results of operations are included in the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements since their respective
acquisition dates. The acquisition costs were allocated to the fair market
value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Included in other
assets and intangibles above is approximately $10.8 million of patents and
other intangibles. The useful life of these intangibles is approximately 10
years. The Company’s integration plans include exit costs for certain plants
and product lines and employee termination costs. The final adjustments to
the purchase price allocations are not expected to be material to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company formulated integration plans for Lenox and other minor
acquisitions as of their respective dates of acquisition. These plans
included facility exit costs of $1.2 million, employee severance costs of $1.2
million and other pre-acquisition contingencies of $1.9 million. As of
December 31, 2003, $1.2 million of integration plan reserves remain, of which
$0.5 million relates to severance payments.

In 2003, the Company decided to abandon its plans to exit certain North
American and European facilities that were contemplated as part of the
integration of the acquired companies. As a result of this decision, the
Company reversed



approximately $48.3 million in exit plan liabilities and reduced the cost of
the acquired companies (goodwill was reduced by $29.8 million and deferred tax
assets were reduced by $18.5 million).

On March 27, 2003, the Company sold its Cosmolab business, a division of the
Other segment, and recorded a non-cash pretax loss of $21.2 million. In 2002,
sales of the division approximated $50 million. On December 31, 2003, the
Company also sold its German frames business (which had 2003 net sales of $9.2
million) a division of the Home Fashion segment, and recognized a pre-tax loss
of $9.2 million.

2002:

On April 30, 2002, the Company completed the purchase of Irwin, a
leading manufacturer of hand tools and power tool accessories. The Company
had previously held a 49.5% stake in Irwin, which had been accounted
for under the equity method prior to acquisition. The purchase price was
$467 million, which included $197 million for the majority 50.5% ownership
stake, the repayment of $243 million in Irwin debt and $27 million of
transaction costs. At the time of acquisition, the Company paid off Irwin’s senior debt, senior subordinated debt and debt under their revolving
credit agreement. The Company has allocated the purchase price to the
identifiable assets. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded
nonoperating expenses of $8.7 million for transaction costs associated with
the acquisition.

The Company formulated integration plans for Irwin and other minor
acquisitions as of the date of acquisition. The integration plans for these
acquisitions resulted in integration plan liabilities of $25.4 million for
facility and other exit costs, $26.8 million for employee severance and
termination benefits and $43.1 million for other pre-acquisition
contingencies. The purchase prices for the 2002 acquisitions have been
allocated to the fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. The Company’s integration plans include exit costs for certain
plants and product lines, as well as employee termination costs. As of
December 31, 2003, $10.6 million of the integration plan reserves remain, of
which $4.6 million relates to remaining severance payments.

2001:

The Company made only minor acquisitions in 2001, for $61.2 million in cash
and $0.1 million of assumed debt.

The unaudited consolidated results of operations for the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002 on a pro forma basis, as though the 2002 acquisition of
Irwin had occurred on January 1, 2001 and the 2003 acquisition of
Lenox had occurred on January 1, 2002, are as follows for the year ended

Restructuring Costs

The Company continues to incur restructuring charges associated with the
Company’s strategic restructuring plan (the “plan”) announced on May 3, 2001.
The specific objectives of the plan are to streamline the Company’s supply
chain to become the best-cost global provider throughout the Company’s
portfolio by reducing worldwide headcount and consolidating duplicative
manufacturing facilities. The Company expects to incur between $460 and $480
million in restructuring charges under the plan.

The facility and other exit cost reserves are primarily related to future
minimum lease payments on vacated facilities and other closure costs.

Under the plan, the Company expects to exit 84 facilities and reduce headcount
by approximately 12,000 people. At the plan’s completion, the Company expects
total annual savings of between $150 and $175 million ($125 to $135 million
related to the reduced headcount, $10 to $15 million related to reduced
depreciation, and $15 to $25 million related to other cash savings). As of
December 31, 2003, restructuring reserves held on the Company’s books were
representative of approximately 100 individual restructuring plans. The

In 2003, the Company incurred facility exit costs and employee severance and
termination benefit costs for approximately 6,000 employees. Under the
restructuring plan, 78 facilities have been exited and headcount has been
reduced by 10,800 employees.



In 2003, the Company announced its intention to close one of its manufacturing
facilities in the Other operating segment by the end of 2003. As a result of
this decision, the Company evaluated its long-lived assets, primarily
property, plant and equipment, for impairment and recorded a non-cash
restructuring charge of $30.5 million. The amount of the impairment was
determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.

In 2003, the Company announced its intention to close two of its manufacturing
facilities in the Cleaning & Organization operating segment. As a result of
this decision, the Company evaluated its long-lived assets, primarily
property, plant and equipment, for impairment and recorded a non-cash
restructuring charge of $34.6 million. The amount of the impairment was
determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The Company also expects to
incur approximately $12.8 million in severance and other facility exit costs.

In 2003, the Company recorded a non-cash restructuring charge of $14.0 million
relating to the curtailment of a pension plan associated with the closure of
one of the Company’s exited facilities. The non-cash restructuring charge has
been included in employee severance and termination benefits as disclosed in
the table above.

The $56.2 million restructuring reserve at December 31, 2003 in the Company’s
Cleaning & Organization operating segment consists primarily of a $40.0 million
reserve for the closure of two manufacturing facilities. The Company expects
to incur $34.6 million in asset impairment charges, $2.8 million in site
clean-up costs and $2.6 million in severance charges for the closure of these
two manufacturing facilities.

The $18.0 million restructuring reserve at December 31, 2003 in the Company’s
Tools & Hardware operating segment consists primarily of an $11.4 million
reserve for the closure of one manufacturing facility. The Company expects to

costs and $1.5 million in severance charges for the closure of this
manufacturing facility.

The $29.9 million restructuring reserve at December 31, 2003 in the Company’s
Office Products operating segment consists primarily of a $10.7 million reserve
for the closure of one manufacturing facility. The Company expects to incur
$2.8 million in asset impairment charges and $7.9 million in severance charges
for the closure of this manufacturing facility.

FOOTNOTE 5

Credit Arrangements

The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of credit
with various banks that are available for short-term financing. Borrowings
under the Company’s uncommitted lines of credit are subject to the discretion
of the lender. The Company’s lines of credit do not have a material impact on
the Company’s liquidity. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had
notes payable to banks in the amount of $21.9 million and $25.2 million,
respectively, with weighted average interest rates of 9.0% and 5.9%,
respectively.

The Company completed a $1,300.0 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility
(the “Revolver”) on June 14, 2002. The Revolver consists of a $650.0 million
364-day credit agreement and a $650.0 million five-year credit agreement. On
June 13, 2003, Newell Rubbermaid rolled over the $650.0 million 364 day
Revolving Credit Facility that was terminating on June 14, 2003. The new
agreement consists of 19 participating banks and will mature on June 11, 2004.
The revolver requires, among other things, that the Company maintain certain
interest coverage and total indebtedness to total capital ratios, as defined
in the agreement. The agreement also limits subsidiary indebtedness. As of
December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with this agreement. No
amounts are outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31,
2003.

In lieu of borrowings under the Revolver, the Company may issue commercial
paper. The Revolver provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue
commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the
amount available for borrowing under the Revolver. Because $650.0 million of
the Revolver expires in June 2007, the commercial paper indebtedness is
classified as long-term in 2003 and 2002.

debentures are all unsecured.



Preferred Debt Securities: As disclosed in Footnote 1, the Company has an
agreement with a financial institution creating a financing entity that is
consolidated in the financial statements. Under the agreement, the Company
regularly enters into transactions with the financing entity to sell an
undivided interest in substantially all of the Company’s United States trade
receivables to the financing entity. In 2001, the financing entity issued
$450.0 million in preferred debt securities to the financial institution.
Those preferred debt securities must be retired or redeemed before the Company
can have access to the financing entity’s receivables. The receivables and
the corresponding $450.0 million preferred debt issued by the subsidiary to
the financial institution are recorded in the consolidated accounts of the
Company. Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered
to be long-term debt. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance
with the agreement. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the aggregate amount of
outstanding receivables sold under the agreement was $777.4 million and $738.2
million, respectively.

Junior Convertible Subordinated Debentures: The Company fully and
unconditionally guarantees 10.0 million shares of 5.25% convertible preferred
securities issued by a 100% owned finance subsidiary of the Company, which are
callable at 102.1% of the liquidation preference as of December 31, 2003,
decreasing over time to 100% by December 2007. Each of these “Preferred
Securities” is convertible into 0.9865 of a share of Company common stock, and
is entitled to a quarterly cash distribution at the annual rate of $2.625 per
share.

The proceeds of the Preferred Securities were invested in $515.5 million of the
Company’s 5.25% Junior Convertible Subordinated Debentures (“Debentures”). The
Debentures are the sole assets of the subsidiary trust, mature on December 1,
2027, bear interest at an annual rate of 5.25%, are payable quarterly and
became redeemable by the Company beginning in December 2001. The Company may
defer interest payments on the Debentures for a period of up to 20 consecutive
quarters, during which period distribution payments on the Preferred Securities
are also deferred. Under this circumstance, the Company may not declare or pay
any cash distributions with respect to its common or preferred stock or debt
securities that do not rank senior to the Debentures. As of December 31, 2003,
the Company has not elected to defer interest payments.

Terminated Interest Rate Swaps: As more fully described in Note 7, at December
31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying amount of long-term debt and current maturities
thereof includes $46.7 million and $18.4 million, respectively, relating to
terminated interest rate swap agreements.

FOOTNOTE 7

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in commodity
prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

Credit Exposure: The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event
of non-performance by counterparties to certain derivative financial
instruments. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties
and presently does not expect default by any of the counterparties. The
Company does not obtain collateral in connection with its derivative financial
instruments.

The credit exposure that results from commodity, interest rate and foreign
exchange contracts is the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value
as of the reporting date. Some derivatives are not subject to credit
exposures as of the reporting date.

Interest Rate Risk Management: At December 31, 2003, the Company had interest
rate swaps designated as fair value hedges with an outstanding notional
principal amount of $800 million, with a net accrued interest receivable of
$2.8 million. These fair value hedges qualify for the “shortcut method”
because these hedges are deemed to be perfectly effective.

There is no credit exposure on the Company’s interest rate derivatives at
December 31, 2003. Credit exposure on the Company’s interest rate derivatives
at December 31, 2002 was $21.5 million.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had long-term cross currency interest rate
swaps with an outstanding notional principal amount of $473.8 million, with a
net accrued interest receivable of $0.3 million. The maturities on these
long-term cross currency interest rate swaps range from three to five years.



Foreign Currency Management: The following table summarizes the Company’s
forward exchange contracts and long-term cross currency interest rate swaps in
U.S. dollars by major currency and contractual amount. The “buy” amounts
represent the U.S. equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies,
and the “sell” amounts represent the U.S. equivalent of commitments to sell
foreign currencies according to the local needs of the subsidiaries. The
contractual amounts of significant forward exchange contracts and long-term
cross currency interest rate swaps and their fair values as of December 31,
were as follows (

The net loss recognized in 2003 and 2002 for matured cash flow forward
exchange contracts was $2.9 million and $1.5 million, net of tax,
respectively, which was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The Company estimates that $2.1 million of losses, net of tax,
deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized in
earnings in 2004.

The net gain recognized in 2002 for forward exchange contracts and cross
currency interest rate swaps used to hedge intercompany loans was $0.4
million, net of tax, which was recognized as part of interest income on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

FOOTNOTE 8

Leases

The Company leases manufacturing and warehouse facilities, real estate,
transportation, data processing and other equipment under leases that expire
at various dates through the year 2011. Rent expense was $132.5 million,
$123.3 million and $112.0 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Future minimum rental payments for operating leases with initial or remaining
terms in excess of one year are as follows as of December 31, 2003 (

Employee Benefit and Retirement Plans

As of December 31, 2003, the Company continued to maintain various deferred
compensation plans with varying terms. The total liability associated with
these plans was $62.1 million and $56.9 million as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. These liabilities are included in Other Accrued
Liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. These plans are partially funded with asset balances of $48.3 million
and $42.9 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These
assets are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted a deferred compensation plan
pursuant to which certain management and highly compensated employees are
eligible to defer up to 50% of their regular compensation and up to 100% of
their bonuses, and non-employee board members are eligible to defer up to 100%
of their directors compensation. The compensation deferred under this plan
along with earnings is fully vested at all times.

The Company has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which is a
nonqualified defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay
supplemental pension benefits to certain key employees upon retirement based
upon the employees’ years of service and compensation. The SERP is being
funded through a trust agreement with the Northern Trust Company, as trustee,
that owns life insurance policies on key employees. At December 31, 2003 and
2002, the life insurance contracts had a cash surrender value of $68.2 million
and $66.2 million, respectively. These assets are included in Other Assets in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of coverage is designed to
provide sufficient reserves to cover all costs of the plan. The projected
benefit obligation was $77.5 million and $68.6 million at December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The SERP liabilities are included in the pension
table below; however, the Company’s investment in the life insurance contracts
are excluded from the table as they do not qualify as plan assets under SFAS
No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.”

The Company and its subsidiaries have noncontributory pension, profit sharing
and contributory 401(k) plans covering substantially all of their foreign and
domestic employees. Pension plan benefits are generally based on years of
service and/or compensation. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute not
less than the minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended or local statutes to assure that plan assets will be adequate to
provide retirement benefits. The Company’s common stock comprised $50.3
million and $67.4 million of noncontributory pension plan assets at December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company’s matching contributions to the profit sharing plans were $21.1
million, $21.4 million and $15.4 million for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In addition, several of the Company’s subsidiaries currently provide retiree
health care and life insurance benefits for certain employee groups.

The Company uses a September 30 measurement date for the majority of its
plans. The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan
assets and funded status of the Company’s noncontributory pension plans, SERP
and postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, (

Assumed health care cost trends have been used in the valuation of

11% (for retirees over age 65) in 2003, declining to 6% for all retirees in
2011 and thereafter.

The health care cost trend rate significantly affects the reported

rate of return on domestic plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit
cost was 8.5% and 10.0% for the years ending December 31, 2003, and 2002,
respectively. The Company’s domestic pension plan weighted-average asset

The Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of
equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return
of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established
through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and
corporate financial condition. The investment portfolio is comprised of a
diversified blend of equity, real estate and fixed income investments. Equity
investments include large and small market capitalization stocks as well as
growth, value and international stock positions.

The Company employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate
of return for plan assets. Historical markets are studied and long-term
historical relationships between equities and fixed-income are preserved
consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with
higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market
factors, such as inflation and interest rates, are evaluated before long-term
capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio return is
established via a building block approach with proper consideration of
diversification and rebalancing. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed
to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

The Company expects to contribute $5.0 million to its unfunded domestic pension
plans and $27.5 million to its other post retirement benefit plan in 2004. The
Company expects no contributions to be made to its funded domestic pension
plans in 2004.



On December 8, 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act (the “Drug Act”) into law. The Drug Act of
2003 introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as
well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that
provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.
The Company is currently reviewing the impact of the Drug Act and has elected
to defer recognition of the benefit to its postretirement healthcare plans; as
a result, the reported benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement cost
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003 do not reflect the effects of
the Drug Act. Once final guidance is issued, previously reported information
is subject to change.

(1)

The weighted average shares outstanding for 2003, 2002 and 2001
exclude the dilutive effect of approximately 12.3 million, 4.5 million
and 3.9 million options, respectively, because such options had an
exercise price in excess of the average market value of the Company’s
common stock during the respective years.

(2)

The convertible preferred securities are anti-dilutive in 2003, 2002
and 2001 and, therefore, have been excluded from diluted earnings per
share. Had the convertible preferred shares been included in the
diluted earnings per share calculation, net income would be increased
by $16.6 million, $16.6 million and $16.8 million in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively, and weighted average shares outstanding would have
increased by 9.9 million shares in all years.

Stockholders’ Equity

In January 2003, the Company completed the sale of 6.67 million shares of its
common stock at a public offering price of $30.10 per share pursuant to an
effective shelf registration statement that was previously filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The net proceeds of $200.1 million were
used to reduce the Company’s commercial paper borrowings.

Each share of common stock includes a stock purchase right (a “Right”). Each
Right will entitle the holder, until the earlier of October 31, 2008 or the
redemption of the Rights, to buy the number of shares of common stock having a
market value of two times the exercise price of $200.00, subject to adjustment
under certain circumstances. The Rights will be exercisable only if a person
or group acquires 15% or more of voting power of the Company or announces a
tender offer after which it would hold 15% or more of the Company’s voting
power. The Rights held by the 15% stockholder would not be exercisable in this
situation.



Furthermore, if, following the acquisition by a person or group of 15% or more
of the Company’s voting stock, the Company was acquired in a merger or other
business combination or 50% or more of its assets were sold, each Right (other
than Rights held by the 15% stockholder) would become exercisable for that
number of shares of common stock of the Company (or the surviving company in a
business combination) having a market value of two times the exercise price of
the Right.

The Company may redeem the Rights at $0.001 per Right prior to the occurrence
of an event that causes the Rights to become exercisable for common stock.

FOOTNOTE 12

Stock Options

The Company’s Amended and Restated 1993 Stock Option Plan expired on December
31, 2002. For options previously granted under that plan, the option exercise
price equaled the common stock’s closing price on the date of grant; options
vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the date of grant. In
2003, a new plan was approved by the Company stockholders (“2003 Plan”). The
2003 Plan provides for grants of up to an aggregate of 15.0 million stock
options, stock awards and performance shares (except that no more than 3.0
million of those grants may be stock awards and performance shares). Under
the 2003 Plan, the option exercise price equals the common stock’s closing
price on the date of grant. Options will vest over five years (which may be
shortened to no less than three years) and expire ten years from the date of
grant. Also under the 2003 Plan, none of the restrictions on stock awards
will lapse earlier than the third anniversary of the date of grant.

The following summarizes the changes in the number of shares of common stock
under option, including options to acquire common stock resulting from the
conversion of options under pre-merger Rubbermaid option plans (

At December 31, 2003, the Company had foreign net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryforwards of approximately $626.9 million that expire at various times
beginning in 2005 and some of which carryforward without expiration. The
potential tax benefits associated with those foreign net operating losses are
approximately $205.6 million. The valuation allowance increased $63.1 million
during 2003 to $167.1 million at December 31, 2003. This increase was
primarily the result of an increase of certain foreign net operating losses
during the year which management is uncertain of the ability to utilize in the
future.

The net deferred tax asset is classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company began exploring various options for
certain businesses in the Home Fashions and Other segments, including
evaluating those businesses for potential sale. As this process progressed,
the Company obtained a better indication of the market value of these
businesses and determined that the businesses had a net book value in excess of
their fair value. Due to the apparent decline in value, the Company conducted
a new impairment test in the fourth quarter and recorded an impairment loss to
write the net assets of these businesses to fair value.

Long-Lived Assets Held and Used

In 2003, the Company made the decision to exit certain product lines, which
resulted in the impairment of fixed assets, primarily in the Cleaning &
Organization segment. The Company determined the fair value of equipment by
estimating



the future cash flows attributable to the fixed assets, including an
estimate of the ultimate sale of the equipment. Accordingly, the Company
recorded a charge to write the assets to their estimated fair value.

Industry Segment Information

In 2003, the Company made several organizational changes, divided the company
into two major groups, and named two chief operating officers. As of December
31, 2003, the Company realigned its reporting segments to reflect the changes
in the Company’s structure and to more appropriately reflect the Company’s
focus on building large consumer brands, promoting organizational integration,
achieving operating efficiencies and aligning the businesses with the
Company’s strategic account management strategy. The realignment streamlines
what had previously been four operating segments (prior years’ segment data
has been reclassified to conform to the current segment structure). The
Company reports its results in five reportable segments as follows:

Segment

Description of Products

Cleaning & Organization

Indoor/outdoor organization, storage, food storage, cleaning, refuse

Office Products

Ballpoint/roller ball pens, markers, highlighters, pencils, office products, art supplies

Home Fashions

Drapery houseware, window treatments, frames

Tools & Hardware

Hand tools, power tool
accessories, manual paint applicators, cabinet hardware, propane
torches

Other

Operating segments that do not meet aggregation criteria, including aluminum and

stainless steel cookware, glassware, hair care accessory products, infant and juvenile

products, including toys, high chairs, car seats, strollers, outdoor play equipment

FOOTNOTE 17

Litigation and Contingencies

The Company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its
business. These proceedings include claims for damages arising out of use of
the Company’s products, allegations of infringement of intellectual property,
commercial disputes and employment matters as well as the environmental
matters described below. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for
punitive as well as compensatory damages, and a few proceedings purport to be
class actions.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company was involved in various matters
concerning federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including
matters in which the Company has been identified by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies as a potentially
responsible party (“PRP”) at contaminated sites under the Federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(“CERCLA”) and equivalent state laws.

In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has considered
several factors, including: the extent of the Company’s volumetric
contribution at each site relative to that of other PRPs; the kind of waste;
the terms of existing cost sharing and other applicable agreements; the
financial ability of other PRPs to share in the payment of requisite costs;
the Company’s prior experience with similar sites; environmental studies and
cost estimates available to the Company; the effects of inflation on cost
estimates; and the extent to which the Company’s and other parties’ status as
PRPs is disputed.

The Company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these
matters as of December 31, 2003 ranged between $14.5 million and $19.9
million. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had a reserve equal to $17.8
million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate, which is
included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. No insurance recovery was taken into account in
determining the Company’s cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost
estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes,
except with respect to two long-term (30 year) operations and maintenance
CERCLA matters which are estimated at present value.

Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and
response activities, the possibility that the Company could be identified as a
PRP at sites identified in the future that require the incurrence of
environmental response costs and the possibility of additional sites as a
result of businesses acquired, actual costs to be incurred by the Company may
vary from the Company’s estimates.



Although management of the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of
these legal proceedings with certainty, it believes that the ultimate
resolution of the Company’s legal proceedings, including any amounts it may be
required to pay in excess of amounts reserved, will not have a material effect
on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the normal course of business and as part of its acquisition and
divestiture strategy, the Company may provide certain representations and
indemnifications related to legal, environmental, product liability, tax or
other types of issues. Based on the nature of these representations and
indemnifications, it is not possible to predict the maximum potential payments
under all of these agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s
obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements
did not have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition
or results of operation.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company has identified and quantified exposures
under these representations and indemnifications of $44.2 million, which
expires in 2006. This guarantee is fully backed by a standby letter of
credit. As of December 31, 2003, no amounts have been recorded on the balance
sheet related to these indemnifications, as the risk of loss is considered
remote.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had $131.0 million in standby letters of
credit primarily related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including
workers’ compensation, product liability, and medical.

FOOTNOTE 18

Subsequent Events
(unaudited)

On January 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its Panex Brazilian
low-end cookware division. Panex had net sales of approximately $37 million in
2003 and is included in the Other business segment.

On January 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its Frames Europe
businesses in France, Spain, and the United Kingdom through a series of
transactions. These businesses manufacture and market picture frames that had
approximately $60 million in sales in 2003 and are included in the Home
Fashions business segment.

On February 5, 2004, the Company completed the sale of Bulldog, a European tool
business that contributed $8 million in sales in 2003. This business is
included in the Tools & Hardware business segment.

In the first quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax loss of
approximately $78 million on the sale of these businesses, primarily to
recognize in the statement of operations at the sale date the foreign currency
translation adjustments previously accumulated in other comprehensive income.

On March 14, 2004, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of its U.S. picture frame business (Burnes),
its Anchor Hocking glassware business and its Mirro cookware business. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will retain the accounts receivable of the businesses and expects gross proceeds as a result of the transaction to be approximately $310 million. The Burnes picture frames business is included in the Home Fashions business segment. The Anchor Hocking and Mirro businesses are included in the Other business segment. Collectively, these businesses had net sales of approximately $695
million in 2003. The Company expects to record a non-cash pre-tax loss of approximately $25 million on the sale of these businesses. Closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approval and certain other customary conditions.



ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

On March 25, 2002, the Company terminated the engagement of Arthur Andersen LLP
(“Arthur Andersen”) as its independent auditor. The decision to terminate the
engagement of Arthur Andersen was recommended by the Company’s Audit Committee
and approved by its Board of Directors. Arthur Andersen’s report on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company for each of the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, did not contain any adverse opinion or a disclaimer
of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, and
the interim period between December 31, 2001 and March 25, 2002, there were no
disagreements between the Company and Arthur Andersen on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of
Arthur Andersen, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter
of the disagreements in connection with its report. During the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the interim period between December 31, 2001
and March 25, 2002, there were no reportable events (as defined in Item
304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission). A letter from Arthur Andersen was included in the Report on Form
8-K/A filed by the Company on April 3, 2002.

The Company engaged Ernst & Young LLP as its new independent auditor effective
March 25, 2002. The engagement of Ernst & Young was recommended by the
Company’s Audit Committee and approved by its Board of Directors. During the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the interim period between December
31, 2001 and March 25, 2002, the Company did not consult with Ernst & Young
regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified
transaction, either completed or proposed, (ii) the type of audit opinion that
might be rendered on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or (iii)
any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as described above)
or a reportable event.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. As of December
31, 2003, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

(b)

Changes in internal controls. There have been no significant
changes in the Company’s internal controls or in other facts that could
significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation.
