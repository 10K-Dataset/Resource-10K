   Item 1.  Business
            --------

        "Newell" or the "Company" refers to Newell Co. alone or with its
   wholly-owned subsidiaries, as the context requires.

   GENERAL
   -------

        The Company is a manufacturer and full-service marketer of staple
   consumer products sold to high-volume purchasers, including, but not
   limited to, discount stores and warehouse clubs, home centers and
   hardware stores, and office superstores and contract stationers.  The
   Company's basic business strategy is to merchandise a multi-product
   offering of brand name consumer products, which are concentrated in
   product categories with relatively steady demand not dependent on
   changes in fashion, technology or season, and to differentiate itself
   by emphasizing superior customer service.  The Company's multi-product
   offering consists of staple consumer products in three major product
   groups: Hardware and Home Furnishings, Office Products, and
   Housewares.  The Company's primary financial goals are to increase
   sales and earnings per share an average of 15% per year, to achieve an
   annual return on beginning equity of 20% or above, to increase
   dividends per share in line with earnings growth and to maintain a
   prudent ratio of total debt to total capitalization, net of cash
   ("leverage").  For the ten years ended December 31, 1998, the
   Company's compound annual growth rates for sales and earnings per
   share were 13% and 16%, respectively, its average annual return on
   beginning equity was 21%, its compound annual growth rate for
   dividends per share was 18% and its average leverage were 26%.

        The Company's growth strategy emphasizes acquisitions and
   internal growth.  The Company has grown both domestically and
   internationally by acquiring businesses with brand name product lines
   and improving the profitability of such businesses through an
   integration process called "Newellization." Since 1990, the Company
   has completed more than 20 major acquisitions (excluding Rubbermaid)
   representing approximately $3 billion in additional sales.  The
   Company supplements acquisition growth with internal growth,
   principally by introducing new products, entering new domestic and
   international markets, adding new customers, cross-selling existing
   product lines to current customers and supporting its U.S.-based
   customers' international expansion.

        On October 20, 1998, the Company and Rubbermaid Incorporated
   ("Rubbermaid") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger
   Agreement"), providing for the merger of a subsidiary of the Company
   into Rubbermaid, leaving Rubbermaid a wholly owned subsidiary of
   Newell ("Proposed Merger").  After the Proposed Merger, the Company
   will be re-named "Newell Rubbermaid Inc."  The Proposed Merger will be
   accounted for as a pooling of interests and will be tax-free for
   federal income tax purposes.  The Company and Rubbermaid expect the

   

   Proposed Merger to become effective before the end of the first
   quarter of 1999.  All information in this Report pertains to the
   Company prior to the Proposed Merger, unless explicity stated
   otherwise.

        Forward-looking statements in this Report are made in reliance
   upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
   Reform Act of 1995.  Such forward-looking statements may relate to,
   but are not limited to, such matters as sales, income, earnings per
   share, return on equity, capital expenditures, dividends, capital
   structure, free cash flow, debt to capitalization ratios, internal
   growth rates, Euro conversion plans and related risks, Year
   2000 plans and related risks, pending legal proceedings and claims
   (including environmental matters), future economic performance,
   management's plans, goals and objectives for future operations and
   growth or the assumptions relating to any of the forward-looking
   information.  The Company cautions that forward-looking statements are
   not guarantees since there are inherent difficulties in predicting
   future results.  Actual results could differ materially from those
   expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  Factors that
   could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to,
   those matters set forth in this Report, the documents incorporated by

   enterprise in accordance with SFAS No. 131 and concluded it has three
   reportable operating segments:  Hardware & Home Furnishings, Office
   Products, and Housewares.  This segmentation is appropriate because
   the Company organizes its product categories into these groups when
   making operating decisions and assessing performance.  The Company
   Divisions included in each group also sell primarily to the same
   retail channel:  Hardware & Home Furnishings (home centers and

   

   hardware stores), Office Products (office superstores and contract
   stationers), and Housewares (discount stores and warehouse clubs).

        The principal product categories included in each of the
   Company's business segments are as follows:

        Segment             Product Category
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        The following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of the
   Company's net sales for the three years ended December 31 (including
   sales of acquired businesses from the time of acquisition and sales of
   divested businesses through date of sale), for the Company's three
   operating segments and the product categories included therein.
   Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to
   approximately 14% of consolidated net sales in 1998 and 15% in both
   1997 and 1996.  Sales to no other customer exceeded 10% of
   consolidated net sales.

     

     

   *Restated for the merger with Calphalon Corporation, which was
   accounted for as a pooling of interests.

        Certain 1997 and 1996 amounts have been reclassified to conform
   with the 1998 presentation.

   Export Sales
   ------------

        The Company's export sales business, defined as sales of products
   made in the U.S. and sold abroad, is conducted through its Newell
   International division.  For purposes of the table immediately above,
   sales attributable to the Newell International division are allocated
   to the operating segment that manufactured the products.

   


   GROWTH STRATEGY
   ---------------

        The Company's growth strategy emphasizes acquisitions and
   internal growth.  The Company has grown both domestically and
   internationally by acquiring businesses with brand name product lines
   and improving the profitability of such businesses through an
   integration process referred to as "Newellization."  Since 1990, the
   Company has completed more than 20 major acquisitions (excluding
   Rubbermaid) representing approximately $3 billion in additional sales. 
   The Company supplements acquisition growth with internal growth,
   principally by introducing new products, entering new domestic and
   international markets, adding new customers, cross-selling existing
   product lines to current customers and supporting its U.S.-based
   customers' international expansion.


   ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION
   ----------------------------

   Acquisition Strategy
   -------------------

        The Company primarily grows by acquiring businesses and product
   lines with a strategic fit with the Company's existing businesses.  It
   also seeks to acquire product lines with a number one or two position
   in the markets in which they compete, a low technology level, a long
   product life cycle and the potential to reach the Company's standard
   of profitability.  In addition to adding entirely new product lines,
   the Company uses acquisitions to round out existing businesses and
   fill gaps in its product offering, add new customers and distribution
   channels, expand shelf space for the Company's products with existing
   customers, and improve operational efficiency through shared
   resources.

   Newellization 
   -------------

        "Newellization" is the Company's well-established profit
   improvement and productivity enhancement process that is applied to
   integrate newly acquired product lines.  The Newellization process
   includes establishing a more focused business strategy, improving
   customer service, reducing corporate overhead through centralization
   of administrative functions and tightening financial controls.  In
   integrating acquired businesses, the Company typically centralizes
   accounting systems, capital expenditure approval, cash management,
   order processing, billing, credit, accounts receivable and data
   processing operations.  To enhance efficiency, Newellization also
   focuses on improving manufacturing processes, eliminating
   non-productive lines, reducing inventories, increasing accounts
   receivable turnover and trimming excess costs.

        Newellization also builds partnerships with customers and
   improves sales mix profitability through program merchandising

   

   techniques.  The Newellization process usually takes approximately two
   to three years to complete.

   History of Acquiring and Integrating Businesses
   -----------------------------------------------

        The Company's growth from a small manufacturer of drapery
   hardware with approximately $15 million in annual sales in 1967 has
   largely been the result of the acquisition and integration of nearly
   100 businesses and product lines to build a strong multi-product
   offering.  Set forth below is a list of the Company's major
   acquisitions since 1991 along with the approximate amount of aggregate
   annual sales for the businesses acquired in the full year prior to
   acquisition.




   

   (1)  All listed trade and brand names are trademarks, which are
   registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, except
   for Gardinia and Panex.

   (2)  Used under exclusive license from Mitsubishi Pencil Co. Ltd. and
   its subsidiaries.

   (3)  Used under exclusive license from Corning Incorporated and its
   subsidiaries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa only.


   Internal Growth
   ---------------

        The second element of the Company's growth strategy is internal
   growth.  Once an acquired business has been Newellized, the Company's
   strategy is to build profitable sales and contribute to the Company's
   internal growth.  Avenues for internal growth include introducing new
   products, entering new domestic and international markets, adding new
   customers, cross-selling existing product lines to current customers
   and supporting its U.S.-based customers' international expansion.  The
   Company's goal is to achieve an internal growth rate of 3-5% per year,
   and over the last five years, the Company has achieved an average of
   5% annual internal growth.  Internal growth is defined by the Company
   as growth from its "core businesses," which include continuing
   businesses owned more than two years and minor acquisitions.  The
   Company intends to continue to pursue internal growth opportunities to
   complement its acquisition growth.

   International

        The Company is pursuing international opportunities to further
   its acquisition and internal growth objectives.  The rapid growth of
   consumer goods economies and retail structures in several regions
   outside the U.S., particularly Europe, Mexico and South America, makes
   them attractive to the Company by providing opportunities to acquire
   businesses, develop partnerships with new foreign customers and extend
   relationships with the Company's domestic customers whose businesses
   are growing internationally.  The Company's recent acquisitions,
   combined with existing sales to foreign customers, increased its sales
   outside the U.S. to approximately 22% of total sales in 1998 from
   approximately 8% in 1992.

        Within the last few years, the Company acquired a number of
   businesses with significant foreign sales.  The Company's first
   significant foreign acquisition was the 1994 acquisition of Corning
   Incorporated's European consumer product business, with annual sales
   of approximately $130 million.  Now known as Newell Europe, the
   acquisition included Corning's manufacturing facilities in England,
   France and Germany, as well as the trademark rights and product lines
   of Pyrex{R} glass cookware used under exclusive license from Corning

   

   Incorporated and its subsidiaries in Europe, Africa and the Middle
   East only.  The 1995 acquisition of Berol, an international
   manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments provided annual
   international sales of more than $80 million and several foreign
   manufacturing facilities.  The 1997 acquisition of Kirsch added annual
   international sales of drapery hardware and window coverings of
   approximately $150 million and several European manufacturing
   facilities.  The 1998 foreign acquisitions included Swish and
   Gardinia, drapery hardware manufacturers in Europe, Panex, a maker of
   aluminum cookware in Latin America, and Rotring, a manufacturer of
   writing and drawing instruments in Europe.  These 1998 acquisitions
   represent approximately $450 million in annualized sales outside the
   United States.

        Additional information regarding acquisitions of businesses is
   included in Item 6 and note 2 to the consolidated financial
   statements.

   MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
   --------------------------

   Customer Service
   ----------------

        The Company believes that one of the primary ways it
   distinguishes itself from its competitors is through customer service.
   The Company's ability to provide superior customer service is a result
   of its information technology, marketing and merchandising programs
   designed to enhance the sales and profitability of its customers and
   consistent on-time delivery of its products.

   Information Technology
   ----------------------

        The Company is an industry leader in the application of
   Electronic Data Interchange ("EDI") technology, an electronic link
   between the Company and many of its retail customers, and invests in
   advanced computer systems.  The Company uses EDI to receive and
   transmit purchase orders, invoices and payments.  By replacing
   paper-based processing with computer-to-computer business
   transactions, EDI has cut days off the order/shipping cycle.

        Building upon its EDI expertise, the Company has established
   "Quick Response" programs with several major customers.  These
   programs allow the Company to implement customized features such as
   vendor-managed inventories in which the Company manages certain or all
   aspects of inventory of several product categories at customer
   locations.  The Company's experience is that its customers benefit
   from such programs by increased inventory turnover and reduced
   customer waiting periods for out-of-stock product.



   

   On-Time Delivery
   ----------------

        A critical element of the Company's customer service is
   consistent on-time delivery of products to its customers.  Retailers
   are pursuing a number of strategies to deliver the highest-quality,
   lowest-cost products to their customers.  A growing trend among
   retailers is to purchase on a "just-in-time" basis in order to reduce
   inventory costs and increase returns on investment.  As retailers
   shorten their lead times for orders, manufacturers need to more
   closely anticipate consumer buying patterns.  The Company supports its
   retail customers' "just-in-time" inventory strategies through
   investments in improved forecasting systems, more responsive
   manufacturing and distribution capabilities and electronic
   communications.  The Company manufactures the vast majority of its
   products and has extensive experience in high-volume, cost-effective
   manufacturing.  The high-volume nature of its manufacturing processes
   and the relatively consistent demand for its products enables the
   Company to ship most products directly from its factories without the
   need for independent warehousing and distribution centers.  For 1998,
   approximately 98% of the items ordered by customers were shipped on
   time, typically within two to three days of the customer's order.

   Marketing and Merchandising
   ---------------------------

        The Company's objective is to develop long-term, mutually
   beneficial partnerships with its customers and become their supplier
   of choice.  To achieve this goal, the Company has a value-added
   marketing program that offers a family of leading brand name staple
   products, tailored sales programs, innovative merchandising support,
   in-store services and responsive top management.

        The Company's merchandising skills help customers stimulate store
   traffic and sales through timely advertising and innovative
   promotions.  The Company also assists customers in differentiating
   their offerings by customizing products and packaging.  Through
   self-selling packaging and displays that emphasize good-better-best
   value relationships, retail customers are encouraged to trade up to
   higher-value, best quality products.

        Customer service also involves customer contact with top-level
   decision makers at the Company's divisions.  As part of its
   decentralized structure, the Company's division presidents are the
   chief marketing officers of their product lines and communicate
   directly with customers.  This structure permits early recognition of
   market trends and timely response to customer problems.

   Multi-Product Offering
   ----------------------

        The Company's increasingly broad product coverage in multiple
   product lines permits it to more effectively meet the needs of its

   

   customers.  With families of leading, brand name products and
   profitable new products, the Company also can help volume purchasers
   sell a more profitable product mix.  As a potential single source for
   an entire product line, the Company can use program merchandising to
   improve product presentation, optimize display space for both sales
   and income and encourage impulse buying by retail customers.

   Corporate Structure
   -------------------

        By decentralizing its manufacturing and marketing efforts while
   centralizing key administrative functions, the Company seeks to foster
   a responsive entrepreneurial culture.  The Company's divisions
   concentrate on designing, manufacturing, merchandising, selling their
   products and servicing their customers, which facilitates product
   development and responsiveness to customers.  Administrative functions
   that are centralized at the corporate level include cash management,
   accounting systems, capital expenditure approvals, order processing,
   billing, credit, accounts receivable, data processing operations and
   legal functions.  Centralization concentrates technical expertise in
   one location, making it easier to observe overall business trends and
   manage the Company's businesses.

   BACKLOG
   -------

        The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.

   SEASONAL VARIATIONS
   -------------------

        The Company's product groups are only moderately affected by
   seasonal trends.  Hardware and Home Furnishings products have higher
   sales in the second and third quarters due to an increased level of
   do-it-yourself projects completed in the summer months; Office
   Products have higher sales in the second and third quarters due to the
   back-to-school season; and Housewares products typically have higher
   sales in the second half of the year due to retail stocking related to
   the holiday season.  Because these seasonal trends are moderate, the
   Company's consolidated quarterly sales do not fluctuate significantly,
   unless a significant acquisition is made.

   FOREIGN OPERATIONS
   ------------------

        Information regarding the Company's 1998, 1997 and 1996 foreign
   operations is included in note 13 to the consolidated financial
   statements and is incorporated by reference herein.



   

   RAW MATERIALS
   -------------

        The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply
   for substantially all of its material requirements.  The raw materials
   and various purchased components required for its products have
   generally been available in sufficient quantities.

   PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
   ----------------------

        The Company has many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade
   names, none of which is considered material to the consolidated
   operations.

   COMPETITION
   -----------

        The rapid growth of high-volume retailers, such as discount
   stores and warehouse clubs, home centers and hardware stores, and
   office superstores and contract stationers, together with changes in
   consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to a significant
   consolidation of the U.S. retail industry and the formation of
   dominant multi-category retailers.  Other trends among retailers are
   to require manufacturers to maintain or reduce product prices or
   deliver products with shorter lead times, or for the retailer to
   import generic products directly from foreign sources.  The
   combination of these market influences creates a highly competitive
   environment in which the Company's principal customers continuously
   evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in pricing
   pressures and the need for ongoing improvements in customer service.

        For more than 30 years, the Company has positioned itself to
   respond to the challenges of this retail environment by developing
   strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers.  The Company
   markets its strong multi-product offering through virtually every
   category of high-volume retailer, including discount, drug, grocery
   and variety chains, warehouse clubs, department, hardware and
   specialty stores, home centers, office superstores, contract
   stationers and military exchanges.  The Company's largest customer,
   Wal-Mart (including Sam's Club), accounted for approximately 14% of
   net sales in 1998.  Other top ten customers included Kmart, The Home
   Depot, The Office Depot, Target, JCPenney, United Stationers,
   Hechinger, Office Max and Lowe's.

        The Company's other principal methods of meeting its competitive
   challenges are high brand name recognition, superior customer service
   (including industry leading information technology, innovative
   "good-better-best" marketing and merchandising programs), consistent
   on-time delivery, decentralized manufacturing and marketing,
   centralized administration, and experienced management.



   

   ENVIRONMENT

   report and in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and is
   incorporated by reference herein.

   ---------

        The Company has approximately 32,000 employees worldwide, of whom
   approximately 9,300 are covered by collective bargaining agreements

   statute.

             Stockholder Matters
             -------------------------------------------------

        The Company's Common Stock is listed on the New York and Chicago
   Stock Exchanges (symbol: NWL).  As of December 31, 1998, there were
   16,315 stockholders of record.  The following table sets forth the
   high and low sales prices of the Common Stock on the New York Stock
   Exchange Composite Tape (as published in the Wall Street Journal) for
   the calendar periods indicated.


        The Company has paid regular cash dividends on its Common Stock
   since 1947.  On February 8, 1999, the quarterly cash dividend was
   increased to $0.20 per share from the $0.18 per share that had been
   paid since February 10, 1998.  Prior to this date, the quarterly cash

   Item 6.   Selected Financial Data
             -----------------------

        The following is a summary of certain consolidated financial
   information relating to the Company at December 31.  The summary has
   been derived in part from, and should be read in conjunction with, the 
   consolidated financial statements of the Company included elsewhere in
   this report and the schedules thereto.

   

   *  Restated for the merger with Calphalon Corporation, which was
   accounted for as a pooling of interests.

   ----

        On August 29, 1994, the Company acquired the assets of the
   decorative window coverings business of Home Fashions, Inc.("HFI"),
   including vertical blinds and pleated shades sold under the Del Mar{R}
   and LouverDrape{R} brand names.  HFI was combined with Levolor and
   together they are operated as a single entity called Levolor Home
   Fashions.  On October 18, 1994, the Company acquired Faber-Castell
   Corporation ("Faber"), a maker and marketer of markers and writing
   instruments, including wood-cased pencils and rolling ball pens, sold
   under the Eberhard Faber{R} brand name.  Faber was combined with
   Sanford and together they are operated as a single entity called
   Sanford North America.  On November 30, 1994, the Company acquired the
   European consumer products business of Corning Incorporated (now known
   as "Newell Europe").  This acquisition included Corning's consumer
   products manufacturing facilities in England, France and Germany, the
   product lines and right to use the foreign registered trademarks
   Pyrex{R}, Pyroflam{TM} and Visions{TM} brands in Europe, the Middle
   East and Africa, and Corning's consumer distribution network
   throughout these areas under exclusive license from Corning
   Incorporated.  Additionally, the Company became the distributor in
   Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Corning's U.S. manufactured
   cookware and dinnerware brands.  For these and other minor 1994
   acquisitions, the Company paid $360.8 million in cash and assumed
   $12.8 million of debt.

        These transactions were accounted for as purchases; therefore,
   results of operations are included in the accompanying consolidated
   financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.  The
   acquisition costs were allocated to the fair market value of the
   assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted in trade names
   and goodwill of approximately $202.2 million.

   ----

        On October 2, 1995, the Company acquired Decorel Incorporated
   ("Decorel"), a manufacturer and marketer of ready-made picture frames. 

   

   Decorel was combined with Intercraft.  On November 2, 1995, the
   Company acquired Berol Corporation ("Berol"), a designer, manufacturer
   and marketer and markers and writing instruments.  Berol was combined
   with Sanford. The U.S. component of Berol is operated as part of the
   Sanford North America division.  The international piece is operated
   as part of Sanford International.  For these and other minor 1995
   acquisitions, the Company paid $210.6 million in cash, issued 379,507
   shares of the Company's Common Stock (valued at approximately $9.5
   million) and assumed $144.2 million of debt.

        The transactions were accounted for as purchases; therefore
   results of operations are included in the accompanying consolidated
   financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.  The
   acquisition costs were allocated to the fair market value of the
   assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted in trade names
   and goodwill of approximately $181.1 million.

   Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
             Operations and Financial Condition
             --------------------------------------------------

             The following discussion and analysis provides information
   which management believes is relevant to an assessment and
   understanding of the Company's consolidated results of operations and
   financial condition.  The discussion should be read in conjunction
   with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.


   Introduction
   ------------

             The Company's primary financial goals are to increase sales
   and earnings per share an average of 15% per year, to achieve an
   annual return on beginning equity ("ROE") of 20% or above, to increase
   dividends per share in line with earnings growth, and to maintain a
   prudent ratio of total debt to total capitalization, net of cash
   ("leverage"). The Company has achieved most of these goals over the
   last ten years, increasing sales and earnings per share at compound
   annual rates of 13% and 16%, respectively, averaging 21% ROE,
   increasing dividends per share at a compound annual rate of 18% and
   averaging 26% leverage. The Company believes that the principal
   factors affecting its ability to achieve these objectives in the
   future are likely to be the realized rates of both acquisition and
   internal growth and the Company's continued ability to integrate
   acquired businesses through a process called "Newellization."


             Since 1990, the Company has more than tripled its sales by
   acquiring businesses with aggregate annual sales of approximately $3
   billion (excluding Rubbermaid). The rate at which the Company can
   integrate Rubbermaid and other recent acquisitions to meet the
   Company's standards of profitability will affect near-term financial
   results. Over the longer term, the Company's ability both to make and
   to integrate strategic acquisitions will impact the Company's
   financial results.

             The Company pursues internal growth by introducing new
   products, entering new domestic and international markets, adding new
   customers, cross-selling existing product lines to current customers
   and supporting its U.S. based customers' international expansion. The
   Company's goal is to achieve an internal growth rate of 3-5% per year,
   and over the last five years, it has achieved an average of 5% annual
   internal growth. Internal growth is defined by the Company as growth
   from its "core businesses," which include continuing businesses owned
   more than two years and minor acquisitions. The Company believes that
   its future internal growth will likely depend on its continued success
   in these areas, as well as external factors. 

   

   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

             The following table sets forth for the period indicated
   items from the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of
   net sales:

     


   * Restated for the merger with Calphalon Corporation, which was accounted for
     as a pooling of interests.


   1998 vs. 1997
   -------------

             Net sales for 1998 were $3,720.0 million, representing an
   increase of $383.8 million or 11.5% from $3,336.2 million in 1997. The
   overall increase in net sales was primarily attributable to
   contributions from Rolodex (acquired in March 1997), Kirsch (acquired
   in May 1997), Eldon (acquired in June 1997), Swish (acquired in March
   1998), Panex (acquired in June 1998), Gardinia (acquired in August
   1998), Rotring (acquired in September 1998) and 4% internal growth.
   The 1997 and 1998 acquisitions are described in note 2 to the
   consolidated financial statements.

             As of December 31, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131,
   "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."
   After reviewing the criteria for determining segments, the Company
   believes it has three reportable operating segments: Hardware and Home
   Furnishings, Office Products, and Housewares. This segmentation is

   

   appropriate because the Company organizes its product categories into
   these groups when making operating decisions and assessing
   performance, and the Company divisions included in each group sell
   primarily to the same retail channel: Hardware and Home Furnishings
   (home centers and hardware stores), Office Products (office
   superstores and contract stationers), and Housewares (discount stores
   and warehouse clubs). 

             Net sales for each of the Company's segments (and the
   primary reasons for the year-to-year changes) were as follows, in
   millions:

   


     Primary Reasons for Changes:

   (1)  2% internal growth and Kirsch (May 1997) acquisition

   (2)  6% internal growth and Rolodex (March 1997) and Eldon (June 1997)
        acquisitions

   (3)  Internal growth

   * Restated for the merger with Calphalon Corporation, which was
   accounted for as a pooling of interests.

             Gross income as a percent of net sales in 1997 was  32.3% or
   $1,076.7 million versus 32.0% or $952.7 million in 1996. Gross margins
   improved as a result of cost savings achieved through the integration
   of several picture frame businesses acquired by the Company in recent
   years, profitability improvement at the Company's Levolor Home
   Fashions division and increased gross margins at several of the
   Company's other core businesses. The increase in gross margins was
   offset partially by 1997 acquisitions which had gross margins lower
   than the Company's average gross margins. As these acquisitions are
   integrated, the Company expects its gross margins to improve.

             SG&A in 1997 was 14.9% of net sales or $497.7 million versus
   15.5% or $461.8 million in 1996. Core business SG&A spending as a
   percentage of sales decreased primarily as a result of cost savings
   arising from the picture frame business integration. This decrease was
   offset partially by the 1997 acquisitions, which had higher SG&A than
   the Company's average SG&A as a percent of net sales. As these
   acquisitions are integrated, the Company expects its SG&A spending
   levels as a percentage of net sales to decline.

             Trade names and goodwill amortization as a percentage of net
   sales in 1997 was comparable to 1996.

             Operating income in 1997 was 16.4% of net sales or $547.1
   million versus 15.7% or $467.3 million in 1996. The increase in
   operating margins was primarily due to cost savings as a result of the

   

   picture frame business integration, profitability improvement at the
   Company's Levolor Home Fashions division and increased core business
   gross margins, offset partially by 1997 acquisitions which had average
   operating margins lower than the Company's average operating margins.

             Net nonoperating expenses in 1997 were 1.9% of net sales or
   $61.8 million versus 1.3% or $39.0 million in 1996. The $22.8 million
   increase was due primarily to a $16.6 million increase in interest
   expense (as a result of additional borrowings related to the 1997
   acquisitions) and a $7.0 million decrease in dividend income. Dividend
   income decreased as a result of the conversion on October 15, 1996 by
   Black & Decker of 150,000 shares of privately placed Black & Decker
   convertible preferred stock, Series B, owned by the Company (purchased
   at a cost of $150.0 million) into 6.4 million shares of Black & Decker
   Common Stock. Prior to conversion, the preferred stock paid a 7.75%
   cumulative dividend, aggregating $2.9 million per quarter, before the
   effect of income taxes. After the conversion, the dividends paid to
   the Company on the shares of Black & Decker Common Stock owned by the
   Company as a result of the conversion totaled $0.8 million per
   quarter, before the effect of income taxes. For supplementary
   information regarding other nonoperating expenses, see note 12 to the
   consolidated financial statements.

             The effective tax rate was 39.6% and 39.5% in 1997 and 1996,
   respectively. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for
   an explanation of the effective tax rate.

             Net income for 1997 was $293.1 million, representing an
   increase of $34.1 million or 13.2% from 1996. Basic earnings per share
   in 1997 increased 13.1% to $1.81 versus $1.60 in 1996; diluted
   earnings per share in 1997 increased 12.5% to $1.80 versus $1.60 in
   1996. The increases in net income and earnings per share were
   primarily attributable to cost savings arising from the picture frame
   business integration, profitability improvement at the Company's
   Levolor Home Fashions division, cost savings as a result of the Kirsch
   integration into the Newell Window Furnishings division and increased
   operating margins at several of the Company's other core businesses.

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

   Sources
   -------

             The Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital
   resources include cash provided from operations and use of available
   borrowing facilities.

             Cash provided by operating activities in 1998 was $302.6
   million, representing a decrease of $73.8 million from $376.4 million
   for 1997. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in payments
   related to liabilities at acquired businesses.

   

             On March 3, 1998, the Company received $378.3 million
   (before the payment of taxes on the net gain) from the sale of
   7,862,300 shares of Black & Decker common stock. The proceeds from the
   sale were used to pay down commercial paper.

             In the third quarter of 1998, the Company received $199.0
   million (before the payment of taxes on the net gains) from the sales
   of Stuart Hall and Newell Plastics.

             The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted
   lines of credit with various banks which are available for short-term
   financing. Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines of credit
   are subject to discretion of the lender. The Company's uncommitted
   lines of credit do not have a material impact on the Company's
   liquidity. Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines of credit
   at December 31, 1998 totaled $69.2 million.

             During 1997, the Company amended its revolving credit
   agreement to increase the aggregate borrowing limit to $1.3 billion,
   at a floating interest rate. The revolving credit agreement will
   terminate in August 2002. At December 31, 1998, there were no
   borrowings under the revolving credit agreement.

             In lieu of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit
   agreement, the Company may issue up to $1.3 billion of commercial
   paper. The Company's revolving credit agreement provides the committed
   backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly,
   commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for
   borrowing under the Company's revolving credit agreement. At December
   31, 1998, $125.0 million (principal amount) of commercial paper was
   outstanding. The entire amount is classified as long-term debt.

             The Company has a universal shelf registration statement on
   file for the issuance of up to $500.0 million of debt and equity
   securities from time to time. The Company issued during 1998 and has
   outstanding as of December 31, 1998 a total of $470.5 million of
   Medium-term notes under this program. The maturities on these notes
   range from five to thirty years at an average interest rate of 6.0%.

             At December 31, 1998, the Company had outstanding $263.0
   million (principal amount) of Medium-term notes issued under a
   previous shelf registration statement with maturities ranging from
   five to ten years at an average interest rate of 6.3%.


   Uses
   ----

             The Company's primary uses of liquidity and capital
   resources include acquisitions, dividend payments and capital
   expenditures.

   

             In 1998, the Company acquired Swish, Panex, Gardinia and
   Rotring and made other minor acquisitions for cash purchase prices
   totaling $413.3 million. In 1997, the Company acquired Rolodex, Kirsch
   and Eldon and made other minor acquisitions for cash purchase prices
   totaling $762.1 million. In 1996, the Company acquired Holson Burnes
   and completed other minor acquisitions for consideration that included
   cash of $42.6 million. All of these acquisitions were accounted for as
   purchases and were paid for with proceeds obtained from the issuance
   of commercial paper, medium-term notes and notes payable under the
   Company's lines of credit.

             Capital expenditures were $147.7 million, $103.2 million and
   $96.2 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The increase in
   1998 was primarily due to the replacement of glass manufacturing tanks
   at the Newell Europe and Anchor Hocking divisions.

             The Company has paid regular cash dividends on its Common
   Stock since 1947. On February 8, 1999, the quarterly cash dividend was
   increased to $0.20 per share from the $0.18 per share that had been
   paid since February 10, 1998. Prior to this date, the quarterly cash
   dividend paid was $0.16 per share since February 11, 1997, which was
   an increase from the $0.14 per share paid since February 6, 1996.
   Dividends paid during 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $116.5 million, $101.8
   million and $88.9 million, respectively.

             Retained earnings increased in 1998, 1997 and 1996 by $279.7
   million, $191.3 million and $170.1 million, respectively. The higher
   increase in 1998 versus the increase in 1997 was primarily due to a
   pre-tax gain of $191.5 million ($116.8 million after taxes) on the
   sale of the Black & Decker common stock. The average dividend payout
   ratio to common stockholders in 1998, 1997 and 1996 was 30%, 36% and
   35%, respectively (represents the percentage of diluted earnings per
   share paid in cash to stockholders).

             Working capital at December 31, 1998 was $769.6 million
   compared to $719.2 million at December 31, 1997 and $482.6 million at
   December 31, 1996. The current ratio at December 31, 1998 was 1.94:1
   compared to 2.01:1 at December 31, 1997 and 1.72:1 at December 31,
   1996.  

             Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of
   cash and cash equivalents, and total capitalization includes total
   debt, company-obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred
   securities of a subsidiary trust and stockholders' equity) was .27:1
   at December 31, 1998, .27:1 at December 31, 1997 and .35:1 at December
   31, 1996.

             The Company believes that cash provided from operations and
   available borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate
   support for the cash needs of existing businesses; however, certain
   events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional
   external financing.

   


   LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

             The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and
   claims, including various environmental matters, that have arisen in
   the ordinary conduct of its business. Such matters are more fully
   described in Note 14 to the Company's consolidated financial
   statements. The Company does not expect any amount it may be required
   to pay in excess of amounts reserved will have a material effect on
   its consolidated financial statements.


   YEAR 2000 COMPUTER COMPLIANCE

   State of Readiness
   ------------------

             Any computer equipment that uses two digits instead of four
   to specify the year will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year
   1999. This "Year 2000" issue could result in system failures or
   miscalculations causing disruptions of operations.

             In order to address Year 2000 compliance issues, the Company
   has initiated a comprehensive project designed to minimize or
   eliminate these kinds of operational disruptions in its information
   technology ("IT") systems, as well as its non-IT systems (e.g., HVAC
   systems and building security systems). The project consists of six
   phases: company recognition, inventory of systems, impact analysis,
   planning, fixing and testing. 

             The Company has substantially completed all phases for its
   IT and non-IT systems in the United States. With respect to
   International IT systems, approximately 60% of the Company's critical
   business systems are currently compliant and approximately 40% are in
   the process of being fixed and tested. With respect to International
   non-IT systems, the assessment phase indicated a need for only minor
   fixing. For both International IT and non-IT systems, the fixing and
   testing phases currently underway are generally expected to be
   completed by June 1999.

             As part of its Year 2000 project, the Company has initiated
   communications with all of its key vendors and services suppliers
   (including raw material and utility providers) to assess their state
   of Year 2000 readiness. Over 80% of its key vendors and service
   suppliers have responded in writing to the Company's Year 2000
   readiness inquiries and have said they will be Year 2000 compliant.
   The Company plans to continue assessment of its third party business
   partners, including face-to-face meetings with management and/or
   onsite visits as deemed appropriate. The Company is prepared in cases
   where its main vendor or service provider cannot continue with its
   business due to Year 2000 problems to use alternate vendors as sources
   for required materials. Despite the Company's efforts, there can be no

   

   guarantee that the systems of other companies which the Company relies
   upon to conduct its day-to-day business will be compliant.


   Costs
   -----

             The Company estimates that it will incur total expenses of
   $14 million to $16 million in conjunction with the Year 2000
   compliance project (excluding such expenses relating to the Rubbermaid
   operations). As of December 31, 1998, the Company has spent $14
   million in conjunction with this project. The majority of these
   expenditures were capitalized since they were associated with
   purchased software that would have been replaced in the normal course
   of business.


   Risks
   -----

             With respect to the risks associated with its IT and non-IT
   systems, the Company believes that the most likely worst case scenario
   is that the Company may experience minor system malfunctions and
   errors in the early days and weeks of 2000 that were not detected
   during its fixing and testing efforts. The Company also believes that
   these problems will not have a material effect on the Company's
   financial condition or results of operations.

             With respect to the risks associated with third parties, the
   Company believes that the most likely worst case scenario is that some
   of the Company's vendors will not be compliant and will have
   difficulty filling orders and delivering goods. Management also
   believes that the number of such vendors will have been minimized by
   the Company's program of identifying non-compliant vendors and
   replacing or jointly developing alternative supply or delivery
   solutions prior to 2000. Due to the diversity of its product lines,
   the Company does not have material sensitivity to any one vendor or
   service supplier.

             The Company has limited the scope of its risk assessment to
   those factors upon which it can reasonably be expected to have an
   influence. For example, the Company has made the assumption that
   government agencies, utility companies and telecommunications
   providers will continue to operate. Obviously, the lack of such
   services could have a material effect on the Company's ability to
   operate, but the Company has little if any ability to influence such
   an outcome, or to reasonably make alternative arrangements in advance
   for such services in the event they are unavailable. 

   

   Contingency Plans
   -----------------

             In the United States, the Company has all of its major
   business systems running on a centralized system for all of its
   operating divisions. Although extensive testing has been completed for
   these systems, the following contingency plan has been adopted for
   Year 2000 issues that may occur on January 1, 2000 and thereafter:

             -    A triage team has been assembled which has the
                  authority and financial capabilities to rectify all
                  systems problems that may occur. 

             -    The team consists of Corporate officers and managers
                  from every support function. 

             -    The team has access to vendor support hotlines and
                  internal staffs. 

             -    Once a problem has been identified and course of action
                  determined, staff will be assigned to provide
                  around-the-clock corrective actions until the problem
                  is resolved.


   INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
   ------------------------

             The Company's non-U.S. business is growing at a faster pace
   than its business in the United States. This growth outside the U.S.
   has been fueled by recent international acquisitions, which
   supplemented the Company's existing Canadian businesses and Newell
   International, the Company's subsidiary responsible for the majority
   of exports of the Company's products. For the year ended December 31,
   1998, the Company's non-U.S. business accounted for approximately 22%
   of sales and 16% of operating income (see note 13 to the consolidated
   financial statements). Growth of both the U.S. and the non-U.S.
   businesses is shown below:

   



     * Restated for the merger with Calphalon Corporation, which was
   accounted for as a pooling of interests.

   MARKET RISK

             The Company's market risk is impacted by changes in interest
   rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and certain commodity prices.
   Pursuant to the Company's policies, natural hedging techniques and
   derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact
   of adverse changes in market prices. The Company does not hold or
   issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.

             The Company's primary market risk is interest rate exposure,
   primarily in the United States. The Company manages interest rate
   exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of
   fixed and floating rate debt. Interest rate exposure was reduced

   

   significantly in 1997 from the issuance of $500 million 5.25%
   Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred
   Securities of a Subsidiary Trust, the proceeds of which reduced
   commercial paper. Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest
   rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions, and, for
   qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in
   interest expense. 

             The Company's foreign exchange risk management policy
   emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third-party commercial
   transaction exposures of one year duration or less. The Company
   focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form: 1) 
   offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows, 2)
   structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate levels
   of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and subsidiary cash flows
   subject to conversion risk, 3) converting excess foreign currency
   deposits into U.S. dollars or the relevant functional currency and 4)
   avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate
   functional currency. In addition, the Company utilizes forward
   contracts and purchased options to hedge commercial and intercompany
   transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of
   commercial transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the
   underlying transactions. Derivatives used to hedge intercompany
   transactions are marked to market with the corresponding gains or
   losses included in the consolidated statements of income.

             Due to the diversity of its product lines, the Company does
   not have material sensitivity to any one commodity. The Company
   manages commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and
   terms of its vendor contracts.

             The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential
   economic loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in
   either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the
   value-at-risk estimation model. The value-at-risk model uses
   historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the
   volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods. It
   estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling
   techniques and including substantially all market risk exposures
   (specifically excluding equity-method investments). The fair value
   losses shown in the table below have no impact on results of
   operations or financial condition as they represent economic not
   financial losses.

     


               The 95% confidence interval signifies the Company's degree
   of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses
   shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that
   interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the
   Company's favor. The value-at-risk model assumes that all movements in
   these rates will be adverse. Actual experience has shown that gains
   and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly
   unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over
   an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered
   projections of future losses, since actual results may differ
   significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets.

   EURO CURRENCY CONVERSION

             On January 1, 1999, the "Euro" became the common legal
   currency for 11 of the 15 member countries of the European Union. On
   that date, the participating countries fixed conversion rates between
   their exiting sovereign currencies ("legacy currencies") and the Euro.
   On January 4, 1999, the Euro began trading on currency exchanges and
   became available for non-cash transactions, if the parties elect to
   use it. The legacy currencies will remain legal tender through
   December 31, 2001. Beginning January 1, 2002, participating countries
   will introduce Euro-denominated bills and coins, and effective July 1,
   2002, legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender.

             After the dual currency phase, all businesses in
   participating countries must conduct all transactions in the Euro and
   must convert their financial records and reports to be Euro-based. The
   Company has commenced an internal analysis of the Euro conversion
   process to prepare its information technology systems for the
   conversion and analyze related risks and issues, such as the benefit
   of the decreased exchange rate risk in cross-border transactions
   involving participating countries and the impact of increased price
   transparency on cross-border competition in these countries.

             The Company believes that the Euro conversion process will
   not have a material impact on the Company's businesses or financial
   condition on a consolidated basis.

                  Report of Independent Public Accountants
                  ----------------------------------------

   To the Stockholders of Newell Co.:

             We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
   of Newell Co. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 
   31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of income, 
   stockholders' equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of 
   the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These consolidated 
   financial statements are the responsibility of Newell Co. management. 
   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
   financial statements based on our audits.

             We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
   accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
   perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
   financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
   includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
   and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
   assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
   made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
   statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
   reasonable basis for our opinion.

             In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
   present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
   Newell Co. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
   and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
   the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity
   with generally accepted accounting principles.

             Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on
   the basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed
   in Part IV Item 14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K is presented for purposes
   of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
   is not a part of the basic financial statements.  This schedule has
   been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audit of the
   basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
   material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein
   in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
                      DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996


   1)  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements
   include the accounts of Newell and its majority owned subsidiaries
   ("the Company") after elimination of intercompany accounts and
   transactions.

     USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of these financial statements
   required the use of certain estimates by management in determining the
   Company's assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related
   disclosures.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales of merchandise are recognized upon
   shipment to customers.

     DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The following
   methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each
   class of financial instruments:

        LONG-TERM DEBT: The fair value of the Company's long-term debt
        issued under the Medium-term note program is estimated based on
        quoted market prices which approximate cost. All other
        significant long-term debt is pursuant to floating rate
        instruments whose carrying amounts approximate fair value.

        COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED
        SECURITIES OF A SUBSIDIARY TRUST: The fair value of the
        Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred
        Securities of a Subsidiary Trust was $527.5 million at December
        31, 1998 based on quoted market prices.

     ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Allowances for doubtful accounts
   at December 31 totaled $24.5 million in 1998, $21.2 million in 1997
   and $15.0 million in 1996.

     INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
   value. Cost of certain domestic inventories (approximately 74%, 84%
   and 90% of total inventories at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
   respectively) was determined by the "last-in, first-out" ("LIFO")
   method; for the balance, cost was determined using the "first-in,
   first-out" ("FIFO") method. If the FIFO inventory valuation method had
   been used exclusively, inventories would have increased by $3.5
   million, $19.2 million and $27.4 million at December 31, 1998, 1997
   and 1996, respectively.

   

        The components of inventories, net of the LIFO reserve, were as
   follows: 

  
        Inventory reserves at December 31 totaled $103.0 million in 1998,
   $93.9 million in 1997 and $82.6 million in 1996.

       OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS: The Company has a 49% ownership
   interest in American Tool Companies, Inc., a manufacturer of hand
   tools and power tool accessory products marketed primarily under the
   Vise-Grip(TM) and Irwin(TM) trademarks. This investment is accounted
   for on the equity method with a net investment of $58.0 million at
   December 31, 1998.

       LONG-TERM MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES: Long-term Marketable
   Equity Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair
   value with adjustments to fair value reported separately, net of tax,
   as a component of stockholders' equity (and excluded from earnings). 
   Gains and losses on the sales of Long-term Marketable Equity
   Securities are based upon the average cost of securities sold. On
   March 8, 1998, the Company sold 7,862,300 shares it held in The Black
   & Decker Corporation. The Black & Decker transaction resulted in net
   proceeds of approximately $378.3 million and a net pre-tax gain, after
   fees and expenses, of approximately $191.5 million. Long-term
   Marketable Equity Securities are summarized as follows:



   

       PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment
   consisted of the following: 



        Replacements and improvements are capitalized. Expenditures for
   maintenance and repairs are charged to expense. The components of
   depreciation are provided by annual charges to income calculated to
   amortize, principally on the straight-line basis, the cost of the
   depreciable assets over their depreciable lives. Estimated useful
   lives determined by the Company are: buildings and improvements (20-40
   years), machinery and equipment (5-12 years). 

        TRADE NAMES AND GOODWILL: The cost of trade names and goodwill
   represent the excess of cost over identifiable net assets of
   businesses acquired. The Company does not allocate such excess cost to
   trade names separate from goodwill. In addition, the Company may
   allocate excess cost to other identifiable intangible assets and
   record such intangible assets in Other Assets (long-term). Trade names
   and goodwill are amortized over 40 years and other identifiable
   intangible assets are amortized over 5 to 40 years. Trade names and
   goodwill and other indentifiable intangible assets consisted of the
   following:



     



       Subsequent to an acquisition, the Company periodically evaluates
   whether later events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the
   remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant revision or
   that the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. If
   factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for possible
   impairment, the Company would use an estimate of the relevant
   business' undiscounted net cash flow over the remaining life of the
   goodwill in measuring whether the goodwill is recoverable. An
   impairment loss would be measured by reducing the carrying value to
   fair value, based on a discounted cash flow analysis.

       ACCRUED LIABILITIES: Accrued Liabilities included the following: 

        Customer accruals are promotional allowances and rebates given to
   customers in exchange for their selling efforts. The self-insurance
   accrual is primarily for workers' compensation and is estimated based
   upon historical claim experience.

       FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Foreign currency balance sheet
   accounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in
   effect at fiscal year end. Income and expenses are translated at the
   average rates of exchange in effect during the year. The related
   translation adjustments are made directly to a separate component of
   stockholders' equity. International subsidiaries operating in highly
   inflationary economies translate non-monetary assets at historical
   rates, while net monetary assets are translated at current rates, with
   the resulting translation adjustment included in net income as other
   nonoperating (income) expenses. Foreign currency transaction gains and
   losses were immaterial in 1998, 1997 and 1996.

   

       ADVERTISING COSTS: The company expenses advertising costs as
   incurred, including cooperative advertising programs with customers.
   Total advertising expense was $111.1 million, $101.1 million, and
   $78.9 million for 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. Cooperative
   advertising is recorded in the financial statements as a reduction of
   sales because it is viewed as part of the negotiated price of its
   products. All other advertising costs are charged to selling, general
   and administrative expenses.

       EARNINGS PER SHARE: The earnings per share amounts are computed
   based on the weighted average monthly number of shares outstanding
   during the year. "Basic" earnings per share is calculated by dividing
   net income (before cumulative effect of accounting change) by weighted
   average shares outstanding. "Diluted" earnings per share is calculated
   by dividing net income (before cumulative effect of accounting change)
   by weighted average shares outstanding, including the assumption of
   the exercise and/or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities
   ("in the money" stock options and company-obligated mandatorily
   redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust). 
   Effective December 31, 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128,
   "Earnings Per Share." As a result, the Company's reported earnings per
   share for 1996 was restated.

       A reconciliation of the difference between basic and diluted
   earnings per share for the years 1998, 1997 and 1996 is shown below:

     



     



       COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of
   Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive
   Income," (SFAS No. 130), which requires companies to report all
   changes in equity during a period, except those resulting from
   investment by owners and distribution to owners, in a financial
   statement for the period in which they are recognized. The Company has
   chosen to report Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other
   Comprehensive Income, which encompasses net income, net unrealized
   gains on securities available for sale and foreign currency
   translation adjustments, in the Consolidated Statements of
   Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income. Prior years have been
   restated to conform to the SFAS No. 130 requirements.

       The following table displays the components of Accumulated Other
   Comprehensive Income:



         NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: Effective December 31, 1998, the
   Company adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an
   Enterprise and Related Information (SFAS No. 131)." See note 13 to the
   consolidated financial statements.

        Effective December 31, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 132,
   "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement

   

   Benefits (SFAS No.132)." See note 8 to the consolidated financial
   statements.

        Effective January 1, 2000, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 133,
   "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."
   Management believes that the adoption of this statement will not be
   material to the consolidated financial statements.

        RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain 1997 and 1996 amounts have been
   reclassified to conform with the 1998 presentation. In particular, the
   Company began reclassifying the amortization of trade names and
   goodwill from non-operating expenses to operating expenses in the
   first quarter of 1998. This change required a restatement for all
   periods presented.

   2)  ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES

   1996 and 1997
   -------------

        On January 19, 1996, the Company acquired The Holson Burnes
   Group, Inc. ("Holson Burnes"), a manufacturer and marketer of photo
   albums and picture frames. Holson Burnes was combined with Intercraft,
   creating the Intercraft/Burnes division.

        On March 5, 1997, the Company purchased Insilco Corporation's
   Rolodex business unit ("Rolodex"), a marketer of office products
   including card files, personal organizers and paper punches. Rolodex
   was integrated into the Company's Newell Office Products division. On
   May 30, 1997, the Company acquired Cooper Industries Incorporated's
   Kirsch business ("Kirsch"), a manufacturer and distributor of drapery
   hardware and custom window coverings in the United States and
   international markets. The Kirsch North American operations were
   combined with the Newell Window Furnishings division. The European
   operations of Kirsch exist as a separate division called Newell Window
   Fashions Europe. On June 13, 1997, the Company acquired Rubbermaid
   Incorporated's office products business, including the Eldon{R} brand
   name (now referred to as "Eldon"). Eldon is a designer, manufacturer
   and supplier of computer and plastic desk accessories, and storage and
   organization products. Eldon was integrated into the Company's Newell
   Office Products division. 

        For these and other minor acquisitions, the Company paid $804.7
   million in cash and assumed $48.8 million of debt. The transactions
   were accounted for as purchases; therefore, results of operations are
   included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since
   their respective dates of acquisition. The acquisition costs were
   allocated to the fair market value of the assets acquired and
   liabilities assumed and resulted in trade names and goodwill of
   approximately $621.2 million.



   

   ----

        On March 27, 1998, the Company acquired Swish Track and Pole
   ("Swish") from Newmond PLC. Swish is a manufacturer and marketer of
   decorative and functional window furnishings in Europe and operates as
   part of Newell Window Fashions Europe. On June 30, 1998, the Company
   purchased Panex S.A. Industria e Comercio ("Panex"), a manufacturer
   and marketer of aluminum cookware products based in Brazil. Panex
   operates as part of the Mirro division. On August 31, 1998, the
   Company purchased the Gardinia Group ("Gardinia"), a manufacturer and
   supplier of window treatments based in Germany. Gardinia operates as
   part of Newell Window Fashions Europe. On September 30, 1998 the
   Company purchased the Rotring Group ("Rotring"), a manufacturer and
   supplier of writing instruments, drawing instruments, art materials
   and color cosmetic products based in Germany. The writing and drawing
   instruments piece of Rotring operates as part of the Company's Sanford
   International division. The art materials portion of Rotring operates
   as part of the Company's Sanford North America division. The color
   cosmetic products piece of Rotring operates as a separate U.S.
   division called Cosmolab.

        For these and other minor acquisitions, the Company paid $413.3
   million in cash and assumed $118.2 million of debt. The transactions
   were accounted for as purchases; therefore, results of operations are
   included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since
   their respective dates of acquisition. The acquisition costs were
   allocated on a preliminary basis to the fair market value of the
   assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted in trade names
   and goodwill of approximately $360.5 million. The Company began to
   formulate an integration plan for these acquisitions as of their
   respective acquisition dates. No integration liabilities have been
   included in the allocation of purchase price as of December 31, 1998.
   Such costs will be accrued upon finalization of each acquisition's
   integration plan. The Company's finalized integration plan will
   include exit costs for certain plants and product lines and employee
   terminations associated with the integration of the Swish and Gardinia
   businesses into the existing Newell Window Fashions Europe businesses,
   the Rotring business into the existing Sanford International writing
   instruments businesses and the Panex business into the existing
   housewares businesses. The final adjustments to the purchase price
   allocations are not expected to be material to the consolidated
   financial statements.

        On May 7, 1998, a subsidiary of the Company merged with Calphalon
   Corporation ("Calphalon"), a manufacturer and marketer of gourmet
   cookware. The Company issued approximately 3.1 million shares of
   common stock for all of the common stock of Calphalon. This
   transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests; therefore,
   prior financial statements were restated to reflect this merger. Net
   sales and net income for the individual companies for periods prior to
   the merger were as follows:

     


             Conforming Calphalon's accounting practices to those of
   Newell resulted in no adjustments to net income or stockholders'
   equity. There were no significant intercompany transactions between
   Newell and Calphalon.

             On August 21, 1998, the Company sold its school supplies and
   stationery business. On September 9, 1998, the Company sold its
   plastic storage and serveware business. The pre-tax net gain on the
   sales of these businesses was $35.6 million, which was primarily
   offset by non-deductible goodwill, resulting in a net after-tax gain
   which was immaterial. Sales for these businesses prior to their
   divestitures were approximately $110 million in 1998 and $160 million
   in 1997.

             The unaudited consolidated results of operations for the
   year ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 on a pro forma basis, as though
   the Rolodex, Kirsch, Eldon, Swish, Panex, Gardinia and Rotring
   businesses had been acquired on January 1, 1997, are as follows:

   Earnings per share (basic)         $2.35          $1.64




   

   Proposed Merger of the Company
   ------------------------------

       On October 20, 1998, Newell and Rubbermaid Incorporated
   ("Rubbermaid") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger
   Agreement"), providing for the merger of a subsidiary of Newell into
   Rubbermaid, leaving Rubbermaid a wholly owned subsidiary of Newell
   ("Proposed Merger"). After the Proposed Merger, Newell will be
   re-named "Newell Rubbermaid Inc." The Proposed Merger, which will be
   accounted for as a pooling of interests and will be tax-free for
   federal income tax purposes, has been approved by the respective
   Boards of Directors, as well as the applicable regulatory agencies.
   The Companies expect the Proposed Merger to become effective before
   the end of the first quarter of 1999.

       Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the outstanding shares of
   Newell's common stock will remain unchanged and outstanding, and each
   outstanding share of Rubbermaid common stock will be converted into
   0.7883 shares of Newell common stock. 

       The following summary contains selected unaudited pro forma
   financial data as of and for the year ended December 31, 1998. The pro
   forma combined earnings per share reflect the issuance of shares based
   on the exhange ratio.

   

   Rubbermaid is an international manufacturer and marketer of consumer
   products sold primarily under the Rubbermaid{R}, Little Tikes{R},
   Graco{R}, Century{R}, and Curver{R} brands. Rubbermaid's major
   customers include discount stores and warehouse clubs, toy stores,
   home centers and hardware stores, drug and grocery stores, catalog
   showrooms, and distributors serving institutional markets. Rubbermaid
   has approximately 12,000 employees.

   3)  CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

       The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines
   of credit with various banks which are available for short-term
   financing. Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines of credit
   are subject to discretion of the lender. The Company's uncommitted
   lines of credit do not have a material impact on the Company's
   liquidity. Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines of credit
   at December 31, 1998 totaled $69.2 million.

       The following is a summary of borrowings under foreign and
   domestic lines of credit:



        During 1997, the Company amended its revolving credit agreement to
   increase the aggregate borrowing limit to $1.3 billion, at a floating
   interest rate. The revolving credit agreement will terminate in August
   2002. At December 31, 1998, there were no borrowings under the
   revolving credit agreement.

       In lieu of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit
   agreement, the Company may issue up to $1.3 billion of commercial
   paper. The Company's revolving credit agreement provides the committed
   backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly,
   commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available for
   borrowing under the Company's revolving credit agreement. At December
   31, 1998, $125.0 million (principal amount) of commercial paper was
   outstanding. The entire amount is classified as long-term debt.

       The revolving credit agreement permits the Company to borrow funds
   on a variety of interest rate terms. This agreement requires, among
   other things, that the Company maintain a certain Total Indebtedness
   to Total Capital Ratio, as defined in this agreement. As of December
   31, 1998, the Company was in compliance with this agreement.

       The Company has a universal shelf registration statement on file
   for the issuance of up to $500.0 million of debt and equity securities
   from time to time. The Company issued during 1998 and has outstanding
   as of December 31, 1998 a total of $470.5 million of Medium-term notes
   under this program. The maturities on these notes range from five to
   thirty years at an average interest rate of 6.0%.

   

       At December 31, 1998, the Company had outstanding $263.0 million
   (principal amount) of medium-term notes issued under a previous shelf
   registration statement with maturities ranging from five to ten years
   at an average interest rate of 6.3%.

       The aggregate maturities of Long-term Debt outstanding are as
   follows:

   5)  COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED
       SECURITIES OF A SUBSIDIARY TRUST OF THE COMPANY

       In December 1997, a wholly owned subsidiary trust of the Company
   issued 10,000,000 of its 5.25% convertible quarterly income preferred
   securities (the "Convertible Preferred Securities"), with a
   liquidation preference of $50 per security, to certain institutional
   buyers. The Convertible Preferred Securities represent an undivided
   beneficial interest in the assets of the trust. Each of the
   Convertible Preferred Securities is convertible at the option of the
   holder into shares of the Company's Common Stock at the rate of 0.9865
   shares of Common Stock for each preferred security (equivalent to the
   approximate conversion price of $50.685 per share of Common Stock),
   subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Holders of the
   Convertible Preferred Securities are entitled to a quarterly cash
   distribution at the annual rate of 5.25% of the $50 liquidation
   preference commencing March 1, 1998. The Convertible Preferred
   Securities are subject to a limited guarantee by the Company and are
   callable by the Company initially at 103.15% of the liquidation
   preference beginning in December 2001 and decreasing over time to 100%
   of the liquidation preference beginning in December 2007.

       The trust invested the proceeds of this issuance of Convertible
   Preferred Securities in $500 million of the Company's 5.25% Junior
   Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2027 (the "Debentures"). The

   

   Debentures are the sole assets of the trust, mature on December 1,
   2027, bear interest at the rate of 5.25%, payable quarterly,
   commencing March 1, 1998, and are redeemable by the Company beginning
   in December 2001. The Company may defer interest payments on the
   Debentures for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters during
   which time distribution payments on the Convertible Preferred
   Securities are also deferred. Under this circumstance, the Company may
   not declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to its capital
   stock or debt securities that rank pari passu with or junior to the
   Debentures. The Company has no current intention to exercise its right
   to defer payments of interest on the Debentures.

       The Convertible Preferred Securities are reflected as outstanding
   in the Company's consolidated financial statements as
   Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred
   Securities of a Subsidiary Trust.

   6)  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

       The Company has only limited involvement with derivative financial
   instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. They are used
   to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency risks.

       Interest rate swap agreements are utilized to convert certain
   floating rate debt instruments into fixed rate debt. Cash flows
   related to interest rate swap agreements are included in interest
   expense over the terms of the agreements. 

       The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts to manage foreign
   exchange risk related to anticipated intercompany and third-party
   commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less. Gains
   and losses related to qualifying hedges of commercial transactions are
   deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions.
   Derivatives used to hedge intercompany transactions are marked to
   market with the corresponding gains or losses included in the
   consolidated statements of income.

       The following table summarizes the Company's forward contracts in
   U.S. dollars by major currency and contractual amount. The "buy"
   amounts represent the U.S. equivalent of commitments to purchase
   foreign currencies, and the "sell" amounts represent the U.S.
   equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies according to
   local needs in foreign subsidiaries. The contractual amounts of
   significant forward contracts and their fair value were as follows:

   Fair Value             $0.3    $324.5     $26.2     $27.3
                          ==================================

       The Company's forward contracts do not subject the Company to risk
   due to foreign exchange rate movement, since gains and losses on these
   contracts generally offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities
   and other transactions being hedged.

       The Company does not obtain collateral or other security to
   support derivative financial instruments subject to credit risk but
   monitors the credit standing of the counterparties.

   

   7)  LEASES

       The Company has minimum rental payments through the year 2018
   under noncancellable operating leases as follows:

   Year ended December 31,    Minimum Payments
   -------------------------------------------
   (In millions)

   1999                            $34.6
   2000                             24.0
   2001                             17.5
   2002                             13.4
   2003                              7.7
   Thereafter                       11.9
                                  ------
                                  $109.1
                                  ======

       Total rental expense for all operating leases was approximately
   $57.1 million, $50.9 million and $45.2 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996,
   respectively. 

   8)  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS

     The Company and its subsidiaries have noncontributory pension and
   profit sharing plans covering substantially all of its foreign and
   domestic employees. Pension plan benefits are generally based on years
   of service and/or compensation. The Company's funding policy is to
   contribute not less than the minimum amounts required by the Employee
   Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or local statutes to assure
   that plan assets will be adequate to provide retirement benefits. The
   Company's common stock comprised $69.3 million, $71.4 million and
   $52.9 million of pension plan assets at December 31, 1998, 1997 and
   1996, respectively. 

       Total expense under all profit sharing plans was $7.6 million,
   $8.0 million, and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 1998,
   1997 and 1996, respectively. 

       In addition to the Company's pension and profit sharing plans,
   several of the Company's subsidiaries currently provide retiree health
   care benefits for certain employee groups.  

       The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations,
   plan assets and funded status of the plans, within the guidelines of
   SFAS No. 132:

     

     

   (1) Recorded in Other Non-Current Assets.

   (2) Recorded in Other Non-Current Liabilities.

   (3) The assumed health care cost trend rate decreases one percent
   every year through 2000 to 6% and remains constant beyond that point. 


   Net pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs include the
   following components:




       The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
   and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated
   benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:

   December 31,                1998       1997     1996
   -----------------------------------------------------
   (In millions)

   Projected benefit
     obligation                $129.6     $68.4    $39.7
   Accumulated benefit

   Fair value of plan assets     52.1      22.1      1.8

   

       The health care cost trend rate significantly affects the reported
   postretirement benefit costs and benefit obligations. A one percentage
   point change in the assumed rate would have the following effects:


                                 1% Increase    1% Decrease

   Effect on postretirement
   benefit obligations                 8.7          (8.1)


   9)  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

       The Company's Common Stock consists of 400.0 million authorized
   shares, with a par value of $1 per share. Of the total unissued common
   shares at December 31, 1998, total shares in reserve included 8.0
   million shares for issuance under the Company's stock option plans.

       Each share of Common Stock includes a stock purchase right (a
   "Right"). Each Right will entitle the holder, until the earlier of
   October 31, 2008 or the redemption of the Rights, to buy one share of
   Common Stock at an exercise price of $200 per share, subject to
   adjustment under certain circumstances. The Rights will be exercisable
   only if a person or group acquires 15% or more of voting power of the
   Company or announces a tender offer following which it would hold 15%
   or more of the Company's voting power.

       In the event that any person or group becomes the beneficial owner
   of 15% or more of the Company's voting stock, the Rights (other than
   Rights held by the 15% stockholder) would become exercisable for that
   number of shares of the Company's Common Stock having a market value
   of two times the exercise price of the Right. Furthermore, if,
   following the acquisition by a person or group of 15% or more of the
   Company's voting stock, the Company was acquired in a merger or other
   business combination or 50% or more of its assets were sold, each
   Right (other than Rights held by the 15% stockholder) would become
   exercisable for that number of shares of Common Stock of the Company
   (or the surviving company in a business combination) having a market
   value of two times the exercise price of the Right.

       The Company may redeem the Rights at $0.001 per Right prior to the
   occurrence of an event that causes the Rights to become exercisable
   for Common Stock.

   10)  STOCK OPTIONS

       The Company's stock option plans are accounted for under APB
   Opinion No. 25. As a result, the Company grants fixed stock options
   under which no compensation cost is recognized. Had compensation cost
   for the plans been determined consistent with FASB Statement No. 123,
   the Company's net income and earnings per share would have been
   reduced to the following pro forma amounts:

   

   Year Ended December 31,             1998           1997
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   (In millions, except per share data)

   Net income:    As reported          $396.2         $293.1
                  Pro forma             389.9          290.0

   Diluted EPS:   As reported           $2.38          $1.80
                  Pro forma              2.35           1.78

       Because the FASB Statement No. 123 method of accounting has not
   been applied to options granted prior to January 1, 1995, the
   resulting pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of
   that to be expected in future years.

       The Company may grant up to 8.0 million shares under the 1993
   Stock Option Plan, of which, the Company has granted 2.5 million
   shares and cancelled 0.3 million shares through December 31, 1998.
   Under this plan, the option exercise price equals the Common Stock's
   closing price on the date of grant, vests over a five-year period and
   expires after ten years.

       The following summarizes the changes in number of shares of Common
   Stock under option:

       The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
   grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
   assumptions used for grants in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively:
   risk-free interest rate of 4.1%, 6.3% and 6.4%; expected dividend
   yields of 1.6%, 1.8% and 1.8%; expected lives of 9.9, 9.9 and 9.9
   years; and expected volatility of 34%, 23% and 20%. 

   11)  INCOME TAXES

       The provision for income taxes consists of the following:


            The non-U.S. component of income before income taxes was $30.5
   million in 1998, $64.5 million in 1997 and $40.4 million in 1996.

   



       The components of the net deferred tax asset are as follows:



            The net deferred tax asset is classified in the consolidated
   balance sheets as follows:



   

       A reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate to the effective
   income tax rate is as follows:



        No U.S. deferred taxes have been provided on the undistributed
   non-U.S. subsidiary earnings which are considered to be permanently
   invested. At December 31, 1998, the estimated amount of total
   unremitted non-U.S. subsidiary earnings is $72.9 million.

   12)  OTHER NONOPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSES 

       Total other nonoperating (income) expenses consist of the
   following:



   * in American Tool Companies, Inc., in which the Company has a 49%
   interest.

   

   13) OTHER OPERATING INFORMATION

   Industry Segment Information
   ----------------------------

       The Company reviewed the criteria for determining segments of an
   enterprise in accordance with SFAS No. 131 and concluded it has three
   reportable operating segments: Hardware & Home Furnishings, Office
   Products, and Housewares. This segmentation is appropriate because the
   Company organizes its product categories into these groups when making
   operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company Divisions
   included in each group also sell primarily to the same retail channel:
   Hardware & Home Furnishings (home centers and hardware stores), Office
   Products (office superstores and contract stationers), and Housewares
   (discount stores and warehouse clubs).

       The principal product categories included in each of the Company's
   business segments are as follows:

          Segment                       Product Category
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   Hardware & Home                 Window Treatments,
     Furnishings                   Hardware and Tools, Picture
                                   Frames, Home Storage

   Office Products                 Markers and Writing
                                   Instruments, Office Storage and
                                   Organization 

   Housewares                      Aluminum Cookware and Bakeware,
                                   Glassware, Hair Accessories



   * Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to
   approximately 14% of consolidated net sales in 1998 and 15% in both
   1997 and 1996. Sales to no other customer exceeded 10% of consolidated
   net sales.

     

   

     

     GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION

   

   



        Operating income is net sales less cost of products sold and
   S,G&A expenses, but is not affected either by nonoperating (income)
   expenses or by income taxes. Nonoperating (income) expenses consists
   principally of net interest expense, and in 1998, the net gain on the
   sale of Black & Decker common stock and the net gains on the sales of
   Stuart Hall and Newell Plastics. In calculating operating income for
   individual business segments, certain headquarters expenses of an
   operational nature are allocated to business segments and geographic
   areas primarily on a net sales basis. Trade names and goodwill
   amortization is considered a corporate expense and not allocated to
   business segments.

        All intercompany transactions have been eliminated, and transfers
   of finished goods between geographic areas are not significant.
   Corporate assets primarily include trade names and goodwill, equity
   investments and deferred tax assets.

   14)  LITIGATION

        The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims,
   including the environmental matters described below, that have arisen
   in the ordinary conduct of its business.

        As of December 31, 1998, the Company was involved in various
   matters concerning federal and state environmental laws and
   regulations, including matters in which the Company has been
   identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain
   state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party
   ("PRPs") at contaminated sites under the Federal Comprehensive
   Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and
   equivalent state laws. 

        In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has
   considered several factors, including: the extent of the Company's
   volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other PRPs;
   the kind of waste; the terms of existing cost sharing and other
   applicable agreements; the financial ability of other PRPs to share in
   the payment of requisite costs; the Company's prior experience with
   similar sites; environmental studies and cost estimates available to
   the Company; the effects of inflation on cost estimates; and the
   extent to which the Company's and other parties' status as PRPs is
   disputed. 

        Based on information available to it, the Company's estimate of
   environmental response costs associated with these matters as of
   December 31, 1998 ranged between $15.0 million and $19.5 million. As
   of December 31, 1998, the Company had a reserve equal to $18.0 million
   for such environmental response costs in the aggregate. No insurance
   recovery was taken into account in determining the Company's cost

   

   estimates or reserve, nor do the Company's cost estimates or reserve
   reflect any discounting for present value purposes. 

        Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental
   investigations and response activities, the possibility that the
   Company could be identified as a PRP at sites identified in the future
   that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the
   possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses acquired,
   actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from the Company's
   estimates. 

        Subject to difficulties in estimating future environmental
   response costs, the Company does not expect that any amount it may
   have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of
   amounts reserved will have a material adverse effect on its
   consolidated financial statements.

        The Company is involved in several legal proceedings relating to
   the importation and distribution of vinyl mini-blinds made with
   plastic containing lead stabilizers. In 1996, the Consumer Product
   Safety Commission found that such stabilizers deteriorate over time
   from exposure to sunlight and heat, causing lead dust to form on
   mini-blind surfaces and presenting a health risk to children under six
   years of age.

        In July 1996, the California Attorney General and the Alameda
   County District Attorney filed a civil suit against 12 named
   companies, including a subsidiary of the Company, alleging failure to
   warn consumers adequately about the presence of lead in accordance
   with California law and seeking injunctions, civil penalties and
   restitutionary relief.

        In August 1996, 15 companies, including a subsidiary of the
   Company, were named as defendants in a national and California private
   class action in Sacramento County Superior Court. In October 1997, 16
   additional companies were named as defendants in this case, in which
   the plaintiffs alleged that the Company's subsidiary used false and
   misleading advertising and employed unfair or fraudulent business
   practices in connection with the presence of lead in their blinds.
   These two cases were coordinated in 1996. 

        On June 22, 1998, the Court entered a Stipulated Consent
   Judgement resolving the Attorney General's case as to the Company's
   subsidiary and most of the defendants. On July 27, 1998, the
   coordination trial judge ruled that this Consent Judgment barred the
   California claims of the private class action plaintiffs, and on
   October 6, 1998, judgment was entered for the Company's subsidiary and
   22 of the other defendants in the private class action. The private
   class action plaintiffs have filed an appeal for both the Consent
   Judgment and the Judgment entered in their action and applying for
   attorneys' fees for their efforts at the trial court level. The

   

   Company's contribution to the judgment amount was not material to the
   Company's consolidated financial statements. 

        In February 1997, a subsidiary of the Company was named as the
   defendant in another case involving the importation and distribution
   of vinyl mini-blinds containing lead, which was filed as an Illinois
   and national private class action in the Cook County Chancery
   Division. In this case, the plaintiffs alleged violations of the
   Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the
   Illinois version of the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, breach
   of implied warranty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, negligence,
   unjust enrichment, and reception and retention of money unlawfully
   received. The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, unspecified damages,
   suit costs and punitive damages.

        In December 1998, 13 companies, including a subsidiary of the
   Company, were named as defendants in a third case involving the
   importation and distribution of vinyl mini-blinds containing lead. The
   case, filed as a Massachusetts class action in the Superior Court,
   alleges misrepresentation, breaches of express and implied warranties,
   negligence, loss of consortium and violation of Massachusetts consumer
   protection laws. The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, unspecified
   damages, compensatory damages for personal injury and court costs.

        Although management of the Company cannot predict the ultimate
   outcome of these matters with certainty, it believes that their
   ultimate resolution will not have a material effect on the Company's
   consolidated financial statements.
