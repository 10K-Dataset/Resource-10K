                                   PART I

   Item 1.  Business
   -----------------

        "Newell" or the "Company" refers to Newell Co. alone or with its
   wholly-owned subsidiaries, as the context requires.

   GENERAL
   -------

        Newell is a manufacturer and full-service marketer of high-volume
   consumer products serving the needs of volume purchasers.  The
   Company's basic strategy is to merchandise a multi-product offering of
   brand-name consumer products, with an emphasis on excellent customer
   service, in order to achieve maximum results for its stockholders. 
   Each group of the Company's products is manufactured and sold by a
   subsidiary or division (each referred to herein as a "division," even
   if separately incorporated).

        The Company manages the activities of its divisions through
   executives at the corporate level, to whom the divisional managers
   report, and controls financial activities through centralized
   accounting, capital expenditure reporting, cash management, order
   processing, billing, credit, accounts receivable and data processing
   operations.  The production and marketing functions of each division,
   however, are conducted with substantial independence.  Each division
   is managed by employees who make day-to-day operating and sales
   decisions and participate in an incentive compensation plan that ties
   a significant part of their compensation to their division's return on
   assets and sales growth. The Company believes that this allocation of
   responsibility and system of incentives fosters an entrepreneurial
   approach to management that has been important to the Company's
   success.

   INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
   -----------------

        Since the beginning of 1993, after the sale of its closures
   business on December 31, 1992, over 90% of the Company's revenues are
   derived from consumer products and, as such, the Company operates in a
   single industry segment.  Prior to 1993, the Company operated in two
   industry segments, Consumer Products and Industrial Products.

        Consumer Products are sold through a variety of retail and
   wholesale distribution channels.  Industrial Products were sold
   directly and through distributors.  Intersegment sales were not
   material.










   PRODUCTS
   --------

        HOUSEWARES

        COOKWARE AND BAKEWARE.  The Company's cookware and bakeware
   business is conducted by the Mirro division, which manufactures
   aluminum cookware, bakeware and kitchen utensils.  Mirro's
   manufacturing operations are highly integrated, rolling its own sheet

   CUSHIONAIRE(r), CUSHIONAIRE PRO(tm), CONCENTRIC AIRE(r), CHANNELON(r)
   and LIMITED EDITION by WEAREVER(tm) .  Mirro also manufactures canning
   accessories, pressure cookers/canners and various specialized cookware
   and bakeware items for the food service industry.  It also  produces

   makes aluminum and plastic kitchen tools and utensils.  Mirro markets
   its products directly to mass merchants, warehouse clubs, grocery/drug

   entering the custom made-to-order non-drapery window coverings market. 
   In 1994, Newell acquired another custom made-to-order business, Home
   Fashions, Inc. and the two businesses were subsequently combined into
   Levolor Home Fashions ("Levolor"). Levolor is a full-line manufacturer
   and marketer of decorative window coverings sold through volume
   purchasers and specialty stores.  There are three major brand names:
   Levolor, DelMar and LouverDrape.
        Levolor products are sold primarily under the trade names of

          OFFICE PRODUCTS

   Sanford, entering the markers and writing instruments market.  In
   1994, Newell acquired another marker and writing instrument company,
   Faber-Castell (whose products are marketed under the Eberhard Faber
   brand name), and the two businesses were subsequently combined.  The
   combined Sanford operation manufactures permanent/waterbase markers,
   rolling ball pens, wood-cased pencils, highlighters, porous tip pens,

        OTHER.  EZ Paintr - manual paint applicator products; BernzOmatic
   - propane and propane/oxygen hand torches and accessories; and Bulldog
   - household hardware.







































   MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
   --------------------------

        During 1994, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries
   amounted to approximately 15% of consolidated sales; each of the
   Company's other customers, individually, amounted to less than 10%.

        Most of the Company's customers are retailers who rely on a
   single or principal source of each of the consumer products that they
   sell.  Accordingly, the divisions focus their marketing effort not on
   the ultimate consumer, but on the retailer, and compete with other
   suppliers for business.  The Company's strategy is to emphasize
   excellent customer service, innovative merchandising programs and a
   quality multiproduct offering.  The Company's computerized order
   processing system allows it to receive orders from its customers on a
   computer-to-computer basis.  This system, and the ability to fill and
   ship orders promptly, are important competitive factors since they
   reduce a customer's order processing costs and allow the customer to
   minimize the inventory it must carry.  The divisions maintain sales
   and service organizations to be responsive to the needs of their
   customers.

   BACKLOG
   -------

        The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.

   SEASONAL VARIATIONS
   -------------------

        The divisions are only moderately affected by seasonal trends. 
   Housewares products typically have higher sales in the second half of
   the year due to retail stocking related to the holiday season, Home
   Furnishings and Hardware products have higher sales in the second and
   third quarters due to an increased level of do-it-yourself projects
   completed in the summer months and Office Products have higher sales
   in the second and third quarters due to the back-to-school season.  As
   a result of these moderate seasonal trends, the Company's consolidated
   quarterly sales do not fluctuate significantly.



















   NET SALES BY PRODUCT CLASS
   --------------------------

        The following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of the
   Company's net sales for the three years ended December 31, 1994
   (including sales of acquired companies only from the time of
   acquisition), for the groups of similar products described previously.

   *  This category is comprised of many different product classes, each
   representing less than 10% of net sales.









   ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES
   -------------------------------------------

        At the foundation of the Company's growth strategy is
   acquisitions.  Since the late 1960s, acquisitions have been the
   Company's primary vehicle for growth.  Over the years, the Company has
   acquired more than 50 companies, and in the 1990s alone, the Company
   completed ten major acquisitions, representing nearly $1.5 billion in
   additional sales.

        Twenty-five years ago, the Company was a small drapery hardware
   manufacturer with $20 million in sales.  Today, the Company is an
   international consumer goods supplier with annualized sales of over
   $2.5 billion.  This dramatic growth is largely the result of using
   acquisitions as the vehicle to execute a multi-product offering
   strategy supported by internal growth from existing product lines.

        In its acquisition planning, the Company looks for branded,
   staple product lines sold to volume purchasers.  These product lines
   must have the potential to reach the Company's high standard of
   profitability, have a low technology level and a long product life
   cycle.  In addition to adding entirely new product lines, acquisitions
   can be beneficial in rounding out existing businesses by filling gaps
   in the product offering, adding new customers and distribution
   channels and improving operational efficiency through shared
   resources.

        The Company has typically acquired companies with unrealized
   profit potential.  "Newellization" is the profit improvement and
   productivity enhancement process that is implemented to bring newly
   acquired product lines up to the Company's high standards of
   profitability.

        Elements of the Newellization process at newly acquired companies
   include establishing a focused business strategy, improving customer
   service, building partnerships with customers, eliminating corporate
   overhead through centralization of administrative functions, trimming
   excess costs, tightening financial controls, improving manufacturing
   efficiency, pruning nonproductive product lines and reducing
   inventories, increasing trade receivable turnover and improving sales
   mix profitability through the application of program merchandising
   techniques.

        As part of the Newellization process to improve profitability,
   sales can often decline as unprofitable product lines are reduced or
   eliminated.  In the Newell strategy, once a company has been fully
   Newellized and is under good control, it is expected to begin building
   profitable sales and contribute to the Company's internal sales
   growth.









        Additional information regarding acquisitions and divestitures of
   businesses is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial
   statements.

   FOREIGN OPERATIONS
   ------------------

        Canadian sales of the Company were approximately 6% of the
   Company's total net sales in 1994, 1993 and 1992.  The Company's
   international division coordinates export sales of consumer products
   to all other foreign countries, totaling less than 3% of 1994 total
   net sales.  Other foreign sales were less than 1% of the Company's
   total net sales in all three years.

        All of the Company's products are sold by the Canadian
   subsidiaries;  however, only decorative window coverings and
   furnishings, picture frames and home hardware are manufactured in
   Canada.

        On November 30, 1994, the Company acquired the European consumer
   products business of Corning Incorporated (now known as Newell
   Europe).  This acquisition included Corning's consumer products
   manufacturing facilities in England, France and Germany, the European
   trademark rights and product lines for Pyrex, Pyroflam and Visions
   brands in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Corning's consumer
   distribution network throughout these areas (Pyrex and Visions are
   registered trademarks of Corning Incorporated).  Additionally, the
   Company became the distributor in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
   for Corning's U.S.-manufactured cookware and dinnerware brands.

   RAW MATERIAL
   ------------

        The Company expects to have multiple sources of supply for
   substantially all of its material requirements.  The raw materials and
   various purchased components required for its products have generally
   been available in sufficient quantities.

   PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
   ----------------------

        The Company has a number of patents and trademarks, none of which
   is considered material to the consolidated operations.

   COMPETITION
   -----------

        The Company competes with a number of well-established domestic
   and foreign manufacturers that serve the markets for its products. 
   Many of the Company's products also compete against a number of
   substitute products.  Although the available information does not







   permit the Company to form a reliable opinion as to its precise
   competitive position within these markets, the Company believes it has
   a significant share in many of the markets.

   ENVIRONMENT
   -----------

        The Company is subject to various laws regulating the discharge
   of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
   protection of the environment.  Regulation in this area is in the
   process of development, including changes in the standards of
   enforcement of existing laws and enactment of new laws.  Although the
   Company, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, is a
   party to various proceedings relating to environmental matters and
   makes capital expenditures for environmental projects, it does not
   believe that the Company will have material capital expenditures for
   environmental control facilities during the current or succeeding
   fiscal year.

   EMPLOYEES
   ---------

        The Company employs approximately 20,000 persons, of whom
   approximately 5,000 are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
   In June 1994, there was a one-week strike at the EZ Paintr division,
   affecting 163 employees. There were no strikes during 1993.  In
   October 1992, there was a three-week strike at the Anchor Consumer
   Glass division.  The Company believes that its employee relations are
   good.





























   Item 2.  Properties
   -------------------

        The following table shows the location and general character of
   the principal operating facilities owned or leased by the Company. 
   The executive offices are located in Beloit, Wisconsin, which is an
   owned facility occupying approximately 9,000 square feet.  Other
   Corporate offices are located in owned facilities in Freeport,
   Illinois (occupying 59,000 square feet) and in Rockford, Illinois
   (occupying 7,000 square feet).  Most of the idle facilities, which are
   excluded from the following list, are subleased while being held
   pending sale or lease expiration.  The Company considers its
   properties to be in generally good condition and well-maintained, and
   are generally suitable and adequate to carry on the Company's
   business.




























   Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
   --------------------------

        Information regarding legal proceedings is included in note 15 to
   the consolidated financial statements and is hereby incorporated by
   reference herein.

        As previously reported in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K
   dated June 20, 1994, Plastics, Inc. ("Plastics"), a subsidiary of the
   Company, pled guilty to a single criminal charge of violating the
   Federal antitrust laws based on its understanding that sometime after
   December 1, 1991, former officers of Plastics agreed with certain
   competitors to raise list prices on certain disposable injection-molded
   commercial plasticware, which agreement(s) ended on or before December
   8, 1992.  During 1994, class action antitrust complaints on behalf of
   customers were filed against Plastics and other manufacturers in the
   United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
   (the "Philadelphia cases"), the United States District Court for the
   Middle District of Florida (the "Florida cases"), the Superior Court of
   California, San Francisco County (the "California cases") and the
   Ontario Court of Justice, Toronto, Ontario, Canada seeking civil
   damages.  Plastics has entered into settlement agreements relating to
   the Philadelphia, Florida and California cases which provide for
   aggregate payments of $4 million and which are subject to approval by
   each of the respective courts.  Management believes that resolution of
   these cases will not have a material effect on the Company's
   consolidated financial position or results of operations.

















   Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
   -------  ---------------------------------------------------

        There were no matters submitted to a vote of the Company's

        The Company's common stock is listed on the New York and Chicago
   Stock Exchanges (symbol: NWL).  The following table sets forth the
   high and low sales prices of the common stock on the New York Stock
   Exchange Composite Tape (as published in the Wall Street Journal) for
   the calendar periods indicated as adjusted for the two-for-one stock
   split discussed below.

        In August 1994, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-
   for-one common stock split in the form of a 100% stock distribution of
   the Company's common stock, which was paid on September 1, 1994 to
   stockholders of record on August 15, 1994.  All per share data was
   adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.


   Item 6.  Selected Financial Data
   --------------------------------

        The following is a summary of certain consolidated financial
   information relating to the Company.  The summary has been derived in
   part from, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated
   financial statements of the Company included elsewhere in this report
   and the schedules thereto.









   (1)  On February 14, 1992, a subsidiary of the Company merged with
   Sanford Corporation ("Sanford"), a designer, manufacturer and marketer
   of marking and writing instruments, plastic desk accessories, file
   storage boxes and other office and school supplies.  The Company
   issued approximately 13.8 million shares of common stock for all the
   common stock of Sanford.  This transaction was accounted for as a
   pooling of interests; therefore, prior financial statements were
   restated to reflect this merger.

        On July 8, 1992, the Company acquired Stuart Hall Company, Inc.
   ("Stuart Hall"), a manufacturer of school supplies, stationery and
   office supplies.  The Company issued 1.6 million shares of common
   stock for all the common stock of Stuart Hall.  On October 1, 1992,
   the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Intercraft
   Industries, L.P., and all of the capital stock of Intercraft
   Industries of Canada, Inc. (collectively, "Intercraft"), manufacturers
   of ready-made picture frames.  The purchase price was $175.0 million
   in cash.  These transactions were accounted for as purchases;
   therefore, the results of operations for Stuart Hall and Intercraft
   are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
   since their respective dates of acquisition.  The cost of these 1992
   acquisitions was allocated to the fair market value of assets acquired
   and liabilities assumed and resulted in goodwill of approximately
   $161.9 million.

        On April 30, 1993, the Company acquired substantially all of the
   assets of Levolor Corporation ("Levolor"), a manufacturer and
   distributor of decorative window coverings.  The purchase price was
   $72.5 million in cash.  On September 22, 1993, the Company acquired
   Lee/Rowan Co. ("Lee/Rowan"), a manufacturer and marketer of coated
   wire storage and organization products.  The purchase price was $73.5
   million in cash.  On November 9, 1993, the Company acquired Goody







   Products, Inc. ("Goody"), a manufacturer and marketer of personal
   consumer products including hair accessories and beauty organizers. 
   The purchase price, excluding the cost of Goody common stock that the
   Company owned prior to the acquisition, was $147.1 million in cash. 
   These transactions were accounted for as purchases; therefore, the
   results of operations for Levolor, Lee/Rowan and Goody are included in
   the accompanying consolidated financial statements since their
   respective dates of acquisition.  The cost of the 1993 acquisitions
   was allocated to the fair market value of assets acquired and
   liabilities assumed and resulted in goodwill of approximately $208.2
   million.

        As part of the Goody acquisition, the Company acquired the
   capital stock of Opti-Ray, Inc. ("Opti-Ray"), a designer and marketer
   of fashion sunglasses and non-prescription reading glasses.  As of
   January 1, 1994, the Company sold the capital stock of Opti-Ray to
   Benson Eyecare Corporation.  The net assets of Opti-Ray, which
   totalled $8.5 million, are included in Other Assets as of December 31,
   1993.  The operating results of Opti-Ray from the date of acquisition
   to December 31, 1993 are excluded from the Consolidated Statements of
   Income and are not material.

        On August 29, 1994, the Company acquired Home Fashions,
   Inc.("HFI"), a manufacturer and marketer of decorative window
   coverings, including vertical blinds and pleated shades.  The purchase
   price was $130.4 million in cash.  This company was combined with
   Levolor and together they are operated as a single entity called
   Levolor Home Fashions.  On October 18, 1994, the Company acquired
   Faber-Castell Corporation, which is a leading maker and marketer of
   markers and writing instruments, including wood-cased pencils and
   rolling ball pens, whose products are marketed under the Eberhard
   Faber brand name ("Eberhard Faber").  The purchase price was $136.5
   million in cash.  This company was combined with Sanford and together
   they are operated as single entity called Sanford.  On November 30,
   1994, the Company acquired the European consumer products business of
   Corning Incorporated (now known as Newell Europe).  This acquisition
   included Corning's consumer products manufacturing facilities in
   England, France and Germany, the European trademark rights and product
   lines for Pyrex, Pyroflam and Visions brands in Europe, the Middle
   East and Africa, and Corning's consumer distribution network
   throughout these areas (Pyrex and Visions are registered trademarks of
   Corning Incorporated).  Additionally, the Company became the
   distributor in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Corning's U.S.-
   manufactured cookware and dinnerware brands.  The purchase price was
   $86.4 million in cash.  These transactions were accounted for as
   purchases; therefore, the results of operations for HFI, Eberhard
   Faber and Newell Europe are included in the accompanying consolidated
   financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.  The
   cost of the 1994 acquisitions was allocated on a preliminary basis to
   the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and
   resulted in goodwill of approximately $163.0 million.








        The unaudited consolidated results of operations for the years
   ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 on a pro forma basis, as though
   Levolor, HFI, Lee/Rowan, Goody, Eberhard Faber and Newell Europe each
   had been acquired on January 1, 1993, are as follows:

                                                               
   (2)  In August 1994, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-
   for-one common stock split in the form of a 100% stock distribution of
   the Company's common stock, which was paid on September 1, 1994 to
   stockholders of record on August 15, 1994.  All per share data was
   adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

   (3)  The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
   Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.'s 112 and 115, "Employers'
   Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" and "Accounting for Certain
   Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  The Company adopted these
   statements in 1994.  The adoption of these statements did not have a
   material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

   (4)  In 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
   for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions."  Adoption of this
   standard did not have a material effect on the annual expense for
   postretirement benefits.  As part of adopting this standard, the
   Company recorded, in the first quarter of 1992, a one-time, non-cash
   charge against earnings of $71.7 million before taxes and $44.1
   million after taxes, or $0.29 per share.  The effect of the change on
   1992 net income before cumulative effect of accounting change was not
   material to any of the consolidated financial statements.

   (5)  On December 31, 1992, the Company sold its closures business for
   a $210.0 million note receivable due and paid January 4, 1993.  The
   Company recognized a net pre-tax gain of $82.9 million on the sale. 
   Sales for this business totalled $160.6 million in 1992.

   Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results
             of Operations and Financial Condition
             ------------------------------------------------

        The following discussion and analysis provides information which
   management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of
   the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial
   condition.  The discussion should be read in conjunction with the
   consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

        The following table sets forth for the period indicated items
   from the Consolidated Statements of Income as a percentage of net
   sales.











   1994 vs. 1993:

        Net sales for 1994 were $2,074.9 million, representing an
   increase of   $429.9 million or 26.1% from 1993.  Net sales for each
   of the Company's product groups were as follows, in millions:

                                    1994        1993       %Change
                                  --------    --------     -------
   Housewares                     $  691.8    $  528.8       30.8%
   Home Furnishings                  642.8       425.5       51.1
   Office Products                   383.2       340.7       12.5
   Hardware                          357.1       335.3        6.5
   Sold Businesses                     -          14.7        N/A
                                  --------    --------     -------
                                  $2,074.9    $1,645.0       26.1%
                                  ========    ========

        The overall increase in net sales was primarily attributable to
   the acquisitions of Levolor, HFI, Lee/Rowan, Goody and Eberhard Faber,
   which are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial
   statements, and internal growth of 6%.  Sales in the housewares group
   were positively impacted by the Goody acquisition and 5% internal
   growth.  The increase in home furnishings was attributable to the
   Levolor, HFI and Lee/Rowan acquisitions and internal growth of 10%. 
   The increase in office products was due to the  Eberhard Faber
   acquisition and 6% internal growth.  The increase in the hardware
   group was solely due to internal growth.  "Sold businesses" represents
   the sales in 1993 of Counselor, which was divested in October 1993. 
   Internal growth is defined as sales growth from continuing businesses
   owned more than two years.

        Gross income as a percent of net sales for 1994 was 32.3% versus
   33.0% in 1993.  The decrease was due to lower than average gross
   margins from the businesses acquired in 1993 and 1994.

        SG&A as a percent of net sales in 1994 was 15.1% versus 15.6% in
   1993.  The decrease was due to 6% internal growth, with only slight
   increases in spending levels.

        Operating income as a percent of net sales was 17.2% in 1994
   versus 17.4% in 1993.

        Net nonoperating expenses were $28.6 million in 1994 versus $10.6
   million in 1993.  The increase was due to additional interest expense
   of $10.9 million, incremental goodwill amortization of $5.3 million
   resulting from recent acquisitions, and a $6.0 million charge incurred
   in connection with a plea agreement by a subsidiary of the Company
   with the U.S. Government.  The increase was offset by a $1.5 million
   payment received from the settlement of a lawsuit and a $1.9 million
   increase in equity earnings from American Tool Companies, Inc., in
   which the Company has a 47% ownership interest.







        The effective tax rate was 40.6% in 1994 and 40.0% in 1993.  See
   note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of
   the effective tax rate and deferred tax issues.

        Net income for 1994 was $195.6 million, representing an increase
   of $30.3 million or 18.3% from 1993.  Earnings per share for 1994 were
   up 18.1% to $1.24 versus $1.05 in 1993.  The increases in net income
   and earnings per share were primarily attributable to contributions
   from the 1993 acquisitions and internal growth, net of increases in
   net nonoperating expenses.

   1993 vs. 1992:
   -------------

        Net sales for 1993 were $1,645.0 million, representing an
   increase of $193.3 million or 13.3% from 1992.  Net sales for each of
   the Company's product groups were as follows, in millions:

                                  $1,645.0    $1,451.7      13.3%
                                  ========    ========

        The overall increase in net sales was attributable to the
   acquisitions of Stuart Hall, Intercraft, Levolor, Lee/Rowan and Goody,
   which are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial
   statements, and internal growth of 4%.  Sales in the housewares group
   were positively impacted by the Goody acquisition.  The increase in
   home furnishings was attributable to the Intercraft, Levolor and
   Lee/Rowan acquisitions and continued expansion in the home center
   channel of trade.  The increase in office products was due to the
   Stuart Hall acquisition and Sanford's continued expansion in the mass
   market channel of trade.  The increase in the hardware group was
   solely due to internal growth.  "Sold businesses" represents the sales
   of the closures business, which was divested in December 1992, and
   Counselor, which was sold in October 1993.

        Gross income as a percent of net sales for 1993 was 33.0% versus
   31.3% in 1992.  The increase was due to lower gross margins at the
   divested closures business in 1992 and increased gross margins at
   Sanford in 1993.

        SG&A as a percent of net sales in 1993 was 15.6% versus 13.9% in
   1992.  The increase was due to lower SG&A at the divested closures








   business in 1992 and higher SG&A at recently acquired Intercraft and
   Levolor.

        Operating income as a percent of net sales in 1993 was 17.4%
   versus 16.0% in 1992.  In 1992, the Company recorded $20.9 million in
   restructuring costs, of which $17.4 million was recorded in the fourth
   quarter.  The primary components of this charge were costs associated
   with the closing of a manufacturing facility and severance costs
   related to businesses acquired in transactions accounted for under the
   pooling of interests method.

        Net nonoperating expenses for 1993 were $55.7 million higher than
   1992, due to an $82.9 million gain recognized on the sale of the
   closures business in 1992.  The gain was reduced by approximately
   $39.2 million of special charges in 1992, including costs associated
   with the Stanley Works investment ($14.0 million), write-offs of
   certain intangible assets ($11.7 million) and costs associated with
   prior acquisitions and the establishment of other reserves ($13.5
   million).  In addition, incremental goodwill amortization was $3.4
   million due to recent acquisitions, and there were no gains on
   securities sales in 1993 compared to $8.6 million in 1992.

        The effective tax rate was 40.0% in 1993 and 41.2% in 1992.  See
   note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of
   the effective tax rate and deferred tax issues. 

        Net income for 1993 was $165.3 million, representing an increase
   of $46.2 million or 38.8% from 1992.  Earnings per share for 1993 were
   up 38.2% to $1.05 versus $0.76 in 1992.

        In 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
   for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions."  As part of adopting
   this standard, the Company recorded, in the first quarter of 1992, a
   one-time, non-cash charge against earnings of $71.7 million before
   taxes and $44.1 million after taxes, or $0.29 per share.  The deferred
   income tax benefit increased $27.6 million as a result of adopting
   this statement.  See note 9 to the consolidated financial statements
   for additional information.


   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

        The Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital resources
   include cash provided from operations and use of available borrowing
   facilities.

        Operating activities provided net cash of $238.4 million during
   1994, an increase of $208.3 million from $30.1 million in 1993.  This
   change was primarily due to the discontinuation of a $125.0 million
   sale of trade receivables program in the third quarter of 1993,








   payment of income taxes in 1993 related to the gain on the sale of the
   closures business and an increase in net income in 1994.

        The Company has foreign and domestic lines of credit with various
   banks and a commercial paper program which are available for short-
   term financing.  Under the line of credit arrangements, the Company
   may borrow up to $360.0 million (of which $267.4 million was available
   at December 31, 1994) based upon such terms as the Company and the
   respective banks have mutually agreed upon.

        The Company has a shelf registration statement covering up to
   $500.0 million of debt securities, of which $257.0 million was
   available for additional borrowings as of December 31, 1994.  Pursuant
   to the shelf registration, at December 31, 1994 the Company had
   outstanding $186.0 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes
   with maturities ranging from one to five years at an average rate of
   interest equal to 6.6%.  The fair value of these notes was $185.1
   million at December 31, 1994.  The Company had outstanding $153.0
   million on December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the fair value of these
   notes was $158.3 million at December 31, 1993 and $160.9 million at
   December 31, 1992.

        The Company entered into a three-year $300.0 million revolving
   credit agreement in August 1993, and a $100.0 million, 364-day
   revolving credit agreement in each of November 1993 and August 1994. 
   The November 1993 364-day revolving credit agreement was renewed for
   an additional 364 days.  Under these agreements, the Company may
   borrow, repay and reborrow funds in an aggregate amount up to $500.0
   million, at a floating interest rate.  At December 31, 1994, there
   were no borrowings under the revolving credit agreements.

        In lieu of borrowings under the credit agreements, the Company
   may issue up to $500.0 million of commercial paper.  The Company's
   revolving credit agreements referred to above provide the committed
   backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper.  Accordingly,
   commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available under
   the Company's revolving credit agreements.  At December 31, 1994,
   $417.1 million (face or principal amount) of commercial paper was
   outstanding, all of which was supported by the revolving credit
   agreements.  The short-term portion of this balance was $117.1
   million, which is classified as notes payable.  The remaining $300.0
   million is classified as long-term debt under the three-year revolving
   credit agreement.

        The Company's primary uses of liquidity and capital resources
   include capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions.

        Capital expenditures were $66.0 million, $58.9 million and $77.6
   million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.









        The Company has paid regular cash dividends on its common stock
   since 1947.  On May 13, 1993, the quarterly cash dividend was
   increased to $0.09 per share from the $0.08 per share that had been
   paid since February 15, 1991.  The quarterly cash dividend was again
   increased to $0.10 per share on May 12, 1994.  In August 1994, the
   Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one common stock split
   in the form of a 100% stock distribution of the Company's common
   stock, which was paid on September 1, 1994 to stockholders of record
   on August 15, 1994.  All per share data has been adjusted to reflect
   the two-for-one stock split.

        Retained earnings increased in 1994, 1993 and 1992 by $134.0
   million, $111.1 million and $68.6 million, respectively.  The average
   dividend payout ratio to common stockholders in 1994, 1993 and 1992
   (before the cumulative effect of accounting change) was 31%, 33% and
   29%, respectively.

        In 1994, the Company acquired HFI, Faber-Castell Corporation
   (whose products are marketed under the Eberhard Faber brand name) and
   the European consumer products business of Corning Incorporated (now
   known as Newell Europe), with purchase prices of $130.4 million,
   $136.5 million and $86.4 million, respectively.  All of these
   acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and were paid for with
   proceeds obtained from the issuance of commercial paper, medium-term
   notes and notes payable under the Company's lines of credit.

        The increases in current assets, current liabilities, property,
   plant and equipment and goodwill during 1993 and 1994 are primarily
   due to the acquisitions occurring in those years.

        Working capital at December 31, 1994 was $133.6 million compared
   to $76.7 million at December 31, 1993.  The current ratio at December
   31, 1994 was 1.17:1 compared to 1.13:1 at December 31, 1993.  The
   total debt to total capitalization was .39:1 at December 31, 1994 and
   .32:1 at December 31, 1993.

        The Company believes that cash provided from operations and
   available borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate
   support for the cash needs of existing businesses; however, certain
   events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional
   external financing.

        The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.'s 112
   and 115, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" and
   "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." 
   The Company adopted these statements in 1994.  The adoption of these
   statements did not have a material effect on the consolidated
   financial statements.









   Environmental Matters
   ---------------------
        The Company is involved in various environmental remediation and
   other compliance activities, including activities arising under the
   federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
   Liability Act ("Superfund") and similar state statutes.  Certain
   information regarding these activities is included in note 15 to the
   consolidated financial statements.  Based on information currently
   available to it, the Company has estimated that remediation costs
   associated with these activities will be between $12.5 million and
   $17.5 million.  As of December 31, 1994, the Company had a reserve
   equal to $14.5 million for such remediation costs in the aggregate. 
   Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment
   and remediation activities, the possibility that sites could be
   identified in the future that require environmental remediation and
   the possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses acquired,
   actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from the Company's
   estimates.  Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental
   costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in
   connection with environmental matters in excess of amounts reserved
   will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
   position, liquidity or results of operations.

   Outlook
   -------
        The Company's primary financial goals are to maintain return on
   beginning equity at 20% or above and increase earnings per share an
   average of 15% per year, while maintaining a ratio of total debt to
   total capital (leverage) at a level of approximately 33%.  The Company
   has achieved its goals over the last ten years, averaging 21% ROE,
   increasing EPS 20% and averaging 29% leverage.  The factors affecting
   the Company's ability to achieve these goals in the future will be the
   rates of internal and acquisition growth.

        In terms of internal growth, the Company has achieved 4-6%
   internal sales growth in each of the last 4 years, and at the same
   time, has improved its core operating margins.  Operating margins may
   be under pressure near-term, however, as a result of rising raw
   material costs.  The Company intends to offset these costs through
   price increases to its customers, but is not certain to what extent
   the cost increases can be offset since its customers are primarily
   volume retailers with significant bargaining power.

        In terms of acquisition growth, since 1990 the Company has more
   than doubled its size, acquiring businesses with annual sales of
   almost $1.5 billion.  The rate at which the Company can integrate
   these recent acquisitions, in order to meet the Company's high
   standards of profitability, may affect near-term EPS growth.  Over the
   longer term, the Company's ability to make strategic acquisitions will
   impact the EPS growth rate.

                  Report of Independent Public Accountants
                  ----------------------------------------


   To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Newell Co.:

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newell
   Co. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994,
   1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income,
   stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
   period ended December 31, 1994.  These consolidated financial
   statements are the responsibility of Newell Co.'s management.  Our
   responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
   financial statements based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
   standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
   to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
   are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
   test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
   financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
   principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
   as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
   believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
   fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newell Co.
   and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, and the
   results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
   years in the period ended
   December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
   principles.

   As explained in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements,
   effective January 1, 1992, the Company changed its method of
   accounting for post-retirement benefits other than pensions.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                      DECEMBER 31, 1994, 1993 AND 1992

   1)   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated financial
   statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned
   subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
   transactions.

        Revenue Recognition:  Sales of merchandise are recognized upon
   shipment to customers.

        Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  The
   following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
   of each class of financial instruments:

        Cash and Cash Equivalents:  The carrying amounts approximate fair
        value because of the short maturity of these instruments.

        Marketable Equity Securities:  The fair values of these
        investments are based upon quoted market prices.

        Long-term Investments:  The fair value of the investment in
        convertible preferred stock of the Black & Decker Corporation
        ("Black & Decker") was based in part on an independent appraisal.

        Long-term Debt:  The fair value of the Company's long-term debt
        issued under the medium-term note program is estimated based on
        quoted market prices.  The carrying value of all other long-term
        debt outstanding approximates fair value due to the floating
        rates charged on these instruments.

        Derivatives:  Premiums paid or received related to interest rate
   swap agreements are amortized into interest expense over the terms of
   the agreements.  Unamortized premiums are included in other assets or
   accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

        Gains and losses relating to qualifying hedges of firm
   commitments or anticipated transactions also are deferred and are
   recognized in income as adjustments of carrying amounts when the
   hedged transaction occurs.

        Accounts Receivable:  On December 5, 1991, the Company received
   $104.7 million from a sale of an interest in trade receivables, with
   limited recourse, pursuant to an agreement that permits the Company to
   sell trade receivables, with limited recourse, to the purchaser from
   time to time.  A $125.0 million interest was outstanding at December
   31, 1992.  At both December 31, 1994 and 1993, there was no interest
   in trade receivables sold under this agreement.

        Allowances for Doubtful Accounts:  Allowances for doubtful
   accounts at December 31, totalled $10.9 million in 1994, $6.2 million
   in 1993 and $5.6 million in 1992.

        Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
   market value.  Cost of certain domestic inventories (approximately
   87%, 83% and 81% of total inventories at December 31, 1994, 1993 and
   1992, respectively) was determined by the "last-in, first-out"
   ("LIFO") method; for the balance, cost was determined using the
   "first-in, first-out"("FIFO") method.





   If the FIFO inventory valuation method had been used exclusively,
   inventories would have been increased by $12.3 million, $9.2 million
   and $8.0 million at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

        The components of inventories at the end of each year, net of the
   LIFO reserve, were as follows:
                                                    December 31,
                                              1994     1993      1992

                                            $420.7   $301.0    $226.2
                                             =====    =====     =====

        Long-term Marketable Equity Securities:  Long-term marketable
   equity securities at the end of each year are summarized as follows:

                                                    December 31,
                                              1994     1993      1992

        Aggregate cost                        48.3     49.0      63.0
                                             -----    -----     -----
        Unrealized gain, net                $ 16.4   $  5.6    $  1.1
                                             =====    =====    ======

        In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115,
   "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." 
   SFAS No. 115 requires, among other things, that securities classified
   as "available for sale" be carried at fair value; however, fair value
   adjustments are excluded from earnings and reported separately as a
   component of stockholders' equity.  This new standard, which was
   adopted prospectively by the Company effective January 1, 1994, did
   not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
   The Company considers all long-term marketable equity securities as
   available for sale.

        Other Long-Term Investments:  The Company owns 150,000 shares of
   privately placed Black & Decker convertible preferred stock, Series B,
   purchased at a cost of $150.0 million.  The Series B preferred shares
   pay a 7 3/4% cumulative dividend, are convertible into Black & Decker
   common stock at $23.62 per share, and have voting rights equivalent to
   the common stock into which they are convertible.  These shares have
   restrictions on disposition by the Company, and Black & Decker has the







   option at the end of ten years to repurchase the remaining preferred
   shares and any common stock issued upon conversion then held by the
   Company.  The market value of this investment approximated cost at
   December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992.  In addition, the Company has a 47%
   ownership in American Tool Companies, Inc., a manufacturer of hand
   tools and power tool accessory products marketed primarily under the
   VISE-GRIP and IRWIN trademarks.  This investment is accounted for on
   the equity method with a net investment of $33.4 million included in
   Other Long-Term Investments at December 31, 1994.

        Property, Plant and Equipment:  Property, plant and equipment at
   the end of each year consisted of the following:

                                                  December 31,
                                            1994     1993      1992
                                            ----     ----      ----
                                                 (In millions)

        Land                             $   9.6  $   7.1   $   6.7
        Buildings and improvements         164.8    136.5     101.8
        Machinery and equipment            515.8    419.1     347.0
                                           ------   ------    ------
                                           690.2    562.7     455.5

        Allowance for depreciation        (235.6)  (192.3)   (162.7)
                                          ------   ------    ------
                                         $ 454.6  $ 370.4   $ 292.8
                                          ======   ======    ======

        Depreciation of property, plant and equipment (stated at cost) is
   provided for by annual charges to income calculated to amortize,
   principally on the straight-line basis, the cost of the depreciable
   assets over their estimated useful lives, which range from five to
   forty years.  Replacements and improvements of fixed assets are
   capitalized.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
   expense.

        Goodwill:  Excess of cost over identifiable net assets of
   businesses acquired is being amortized over 40 years on a straight-
   line basis.  Subsequent to an acquisition, the Company continually
   evaluates whether later events and circumstances have occurred that
   indicate the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant
   revision or that the remaining balance of goodwill may not be
   recoverable.  When factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated
   for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related
   division's undiscounted net income over the remaining life of the
   goodwill in measuring whether the goodwill is recoverable. 
   Accumulated amortization of goodwill was $57.0 million, $42.1 million
   and $32.0 million at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.









        Accrued Liabilities:  Accrued liabilities at the end of each year
   included the following:
                                                    December 31,
                                              1994     1993      1992
                                              ----     ----      ----
                                                   (In millions)

        Promotion and advertising accruals  $ 76.5   $ 54.4    $ 37.5
        Accrued insurance reserves            36.0     36.3      29.8


        Foreign Currency Translation:  Financial statements of foreign
   subsidiaries are translated in U.S. dollars in accordance with the
   provisions of SFAS No. 52.  Foreign currency transaction gains and
   losses were insignificant in 1994, 1993 and 1992.

        Cash Flows:  For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash
   Flows, the Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments
   with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
   equivalents.  Cash paid for income taxes and interest were as follows:

                                                    December 31,
                                              1994     1993     1992
                                              ----     ----     ----
                                                   (In millions)

        Income taxes                        $115.9   $144.7   $ 81.5
        Interest                              31.1     18.9     14.5  


        Reclassification:  Certain 1992 and 1993 amounts have been
   reclassified to conform with the 1994 presentation.


























   2)   ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES

        On February 14, 1992, a subsidiary of the Company merged with
   Sanford Corporation ("Sanford"), a designer, manufacturer and marketer
   of marking and writing instruments, plastic desk accessories, file
   storage boxes and other office and school supplies.  The Company
   issued approximately 13.8 million shares of common stock for all the
   common stock of Sanford.  This transaction was accounted for as a
   pooling of interests; therefore, prior financial statements were
   restated to reflect this merger.

        On July 8, 1992, the Company acquired Stuart Hall Company, Inc.
   ("Stuart Hall"), a manufacturer of school supplies, stationery and
   office supplies.  The Company issued 1.6 million shares of common
   stock for all the common stock of Stuart Hall.  On October 1, 1992,
   the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Intercraft
   Industries, L.P., and all of the capital stock of Intercraft
   Industries of Canada, Inc. (collectively, "Intercraft"), manufacturers
   of ready-made picture frames.  The purchase price was $175.0 million
   in cash.  These transactions were accounted for as purchases;
   therefore, the results of operations for Stuart Hall and Intercraft
   are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
   since their respective dates of acquisition.  The cost of these 1992
   acquisitions was allocated to the fair market value of assets acquired
   and liabilities assumed and resulted in goodwill of approximately
   $161.9 million.

        On April 30, 1993, the Company acquired substantially all of the
   assets of Levolor Corporation ("Levolor"), a manufacturer and
   distributor of decorative window coverings.  The purchase price was
   $72.5 million in cash.  On September 22, 1993, the Company acquired
   Lee/Rowan Co. ("Lee/Rowan"), a manufacturer and marketer of coated
   wire storage and organization products.  The purchase price was $73.5
   million in cash.  On November 9, 1993, the Company acquired Goody
   Products, Inc. ("Goody"), a manufacturer and marketer of personal
   consumer products including hair accessories and beauty organizers. 
   The purchase price, excluding the cost of Goody common stock that the
   Company owned prior to the acquisition, was $147.1 million in cash. 
   These transactions were accounted for as purchases; therefore, the
   results of operations for Levolor, Lee/Rowan and Goody are included in
   the accompanying consolidated financial statements since their
   respective dates of acquisition.  The cost of the 1993 acquisitions
   was allocated to the fair market value of assets acquired and
   liabilities assumed and resulted in goodwill of approximately $208.2
   million.

        As part of the Goody acquisition, the Company acquired the
   capital stock of Opti-Ray, Inc. ("Opti-Ray"), a designer and marketer
   of fashion sunglasses and non-prescription reading glasses.  As of
   January 1, 1994, the Company sold the capital stock of Opti-Ray to
   Benson Eyecare Corporation.  The net assets of Opti-Ray, which







   totalled $8.5 million, are included in Other Assets as of December 31,
   1993.  The operating results of Opti-Ray from the date of acquisition
   to December 31, 1993 are excluded from the Consolidated Statements of
   Income and are not material.

        On August 29, 1994, the Company acquired Home Fashions,
   Inc.("HFI"), a manufacturer and marketer of decorative window
   coverings, including vertical blinds and pleated shades.  The purchase
   price was $130.4 million in cash.  This company was combined with
   Levolor and together they are operated as single entity called Levolor
   Home Fashions.  On October 18, 1994, the Company acquired Faber-
   Castell Corporation, which is a leading maker and marketer of markers
   and writing instruments, including wood-cased pencils and rolling ball
   pens, whose products are marketed under the Eberhard Faber brand name
   ("Eberhard Faber").  The purchase price was $136.5 million in cash. 
   This company was combined with Sanford and together they are operated
   as a single entity called Sanford.  On November 30, 1994, the Company
   acquired the European consumer products business of Corning
   Incorporated (now known as Newell Europe).  This acquisition included
   Corning's consumer products manufacturing facilities in England,
   France and Germany, the European trademark rights and product lines
   for Pyrex, Pyroflam and Visions brands in Europe, the Middle East and
   Africa, and Corning's consumer distribution network throughout these
   areas (Pyrex and Visions are registered trademarks of Corning
   Incorporated).  Additionally, the Company became the distributor in
   Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Corning's U.S.-manufactured
   cookware and dinnerware brands.  The purchase price was $86.4 million
   in cash.  These transactions were accounted for as purchases;
   therefore, the results of operations for HFI, Eberhard Faber and
   Newell Europe are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
   statements since their respective dates of acquisition. The cost of
   the 1994 acquisitions was allocated on a preliminary basis to the fair
   market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted
   in goodwill of approximately $163.0 million.

        The unaudited consolidated results of operations for the years
   ended December 31, 1994 and 1993 on a pro forma basis, as though
   Levolor, HFI, Lee/Rowan, Goody, Eberhard Faber and Newell Europe each
   had been acquired on January 1, 1993, are as follows:

                                               1994          1993
                                               ----          ----
                                     (In millions, except per share data)
        Net sales                           $2,455.5      $2,439.4
        Net income                             195.1         167.1
        Earnings per share                       1.24          1.06 
                                                               
        On December 31, 1992, the Company sold its closures business for
   a $210.0 million note receivable due and paid January 4, 1993.  The
   Company recognized a net pre-tax gain of $82.9 million on the sale. 
   Sales for this business totalled $160.6 million in 1992.







   3)   RESTRUCTURING COSTS

        In the year ended December 31, 1992, the Company recorded $20.9
   million in restructuring costs, of which $17.4 million was recorded in
   the fourth quarter.  The primary components of this charge included
   costs associated with the closing of a manufacturing facility and
   severance costs related to businesses acquired in transactions
   accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method.
















































   4)   CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

        The Company has foreign and domestic lines of credit with various
   banks and a commercial paper program which are available for short-
   term financing.  Under the line of credit arrangements, the Company
   may borrow up to $360.0 million (of which $267.4 million was available
   at December 31, 1994) based upon such terms as the Company and the
   respective banks have mutually agreed upon.

        In connection with $35.0 million of the line of credit facilities
   noted above, the Company has agreed to maintain compensating balances,
   generally at 2.5% of the credit facility.  Compensating balances are
   not restricted as to withdrawals and serve as part of the Company's
   minimum operating cash balances.

        The following is a summary of line of credit notes payable to
   banks:

                                             1994       1993        1992

        In 1993, the Company began issuing commercial paper under a
   $400.0 million program, which was subsequently increased to $500.0
   million.  The revolving credit facilities, as described in note 5 to
   the consolidated financial statements, provide the committed backup
   liquidity required to issue commercial paper.  Three dealers were
   engaged to market the program.

        The following is a summary of commercial paper:

                                            =====      =====       =====

        The Company has a shelf registration statement covering up to
   $500.0 million of debt securities, of which $257.0 million was
   available for additional borrowings as of December 31, 1994.  Pursuant
   to the shelf registration, at December 31, 1994, the Company had
   outstanding $186.0 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes
   with maturities ranging from one to five years at an average rate of
   interest equal to 6.6%.  The fair value of these notes was $185.1
   million at December 31, 1994.  The Company had outstanding $153.0
   million on December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the fair value of these
   notes was $158.3 million at December 31, 1993 and $160.9 million at
   December 31, 1992.

        The Company entered into a three-year $300.0 million revolving
   credit agreement in August 1993, and a $100.0 million, 364-day
   revolving credit agreement in each of November 1993 and August 1994. 
   The November 1993 364-day revolving credit agreement was renewed for
   an additional 364 days.  Under these agreements, the Company may
   borrow, repay and reborrow funds in an aggregate amount up to $500.0
   million, at a floating interest rate.  At December 31, 1994, there
   were no borrowings under the revolving credit agreements.

        In lieu of borrowings under the credit agreements, the Company
   may issue up to $500.0 million of commercial paper.  The Company's
   revolving credit agreements referred to above provide the committed
   backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper.  Accordingly,
   commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount available under
   the Company's revolving credit agreements.  At December 31, 1994,
   $417.1 million (face or principal amount) of commercial paper was
   outstanding, all of which was supported by the revolving credit
   agreements.  The short-term portion of this balance was $117.1
   million, which is classified as notes payable.  The remaining $300.0
   million is classified as long-term debt under the three-year revolving
   credit agreement.






        The revolving credit agreements permit the Company to borrow
   funds using Syndicated loans (Base Rate loans or Eurodollar loans),
   Money Market loans (LIBOR Market loans or Set Rate loans) or
   Acceptance liabilities, as selected by the Company.  The terms of
   these agreements require, among other things, that the Company
   maintain a certain Total Debt to Total Capital Ratio and a minimum
   Operating Income to Interest Expense Ratio, all capitalized terms as
   defined in these agreements.  As of December 31, 1994, the Company was
   in compliance with these agreements.

        The aggregate maturities of long-term debt outstanding at
   December 31, 1994, are as follows:

                       Year           Aggregate Maturities

   6)   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

        The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
   financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. 
   They are used to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency
   risks.

        Interest rate swap agreements are utilized to convert certain
   floating rate debt instruments into fixed rate debt or to convert
   certain floating rate debt based on federal funds rates to floating
   rate debt based upon commercial paper rates.  As of December 31, 1994,
   the Company was party to one interest rate swap agreement which
   terminates in June 1996.  The agreement requires the Company to pay on
   a monthly basis the amounts by which the commercial paper rate exceeds
   the Federal Funds rate on $50.0 million of debt.

        The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge certain
   purchase commitments denominated in currencies other than the domestic
   currency (primarily Japanese yen and U.S. dollar for the Company's
   Canadian subsidiary).  The term of the currency derivatives is rarely
   more than one year.  The purpose of the Company's foreign currency
   hedging activities is to protect the Company from some of the risk of
   foreign currency fluctuations on foreign denominated purchases.

        As of December 31, 1994, the Company had contracts to buy 150
   million Japanese yen and the Company's Canadian subsidiary had several
   contracts to buy 7.3 million U.S. dollars.  The deferred unrealized
   gains and losses, based upon dealer quotes from hedging firm
   purchases, are not material.

        The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-
   performance by the counterparties to its interest rate swap and
   foreign exchange contracts.  The Company anticipates, however, that
   counterparties will be able to satisfy fully their obligations under
   the contracts.  The Company does not obtain collateral or other
   security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but
   monitors the credit standing of the counterparties.  The market value
   of all the Company's derivatives approximates its carrying value.




















   7)   LEASES

        The Company leases manufacturing, distribution and office
   facilities, as well as transportation and data processing equipment
   under noncancellable leases which expire at various dates through the
   year 2007.

        Future minimum rental payments under noncancellable operating
   leases are as follows:

                                 Year           Minimum Payments

                                                       ====

        Total rental expense for all operating leases was approximately
   $31.8 million, $26.0 million and $18.9 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
   respectively.































   8)   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS

        The Company and its subsidiaries have noncontributory pension
   plans covering substantially all employees.  Pension plan benefits are
   generally based on years of service and/or compensation.  The
   Company's funding policy is to contribute not less than the minimum
   amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
   1974 or additional amounts to assure that plan assets will be adequate
   to provide retirement benefits.  Due to the overfunded status of most
   of the pension plans, contributions to these plans were insignificant
   during the past three years.  Total expense under all pension and
   profit sharing plans was  $8.5 million, $3.2 million and $1.7 million
   for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

        The net periodic pension cost components for the U.S. pension
   plans are as follows:

                                             1994       1993       1992

        The following table sets forth the funded status of the U.S.
   pension plans and the amount recognized in the Company's consolidated
   balance sheets:











   9)   RETIREE HEALTH CARE
        Several of the Company's subsidiaries currently provide retiree
   health care benefits for certain employee groups.  In 1992, the
   Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
   Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions."  This standard requires
   that the expected cost of retiree health benefits be charged to
   expense during the years that the employees render service rather than
   the Company's past practice of recognizing these costs on a cash
   basis.  As part of adopting this standard, the Company recorded, in
   the first quarter of 1992, a one-time, non-cash charge against
   earnings of $71.7 million before taxes and $44.1 million after taxes,
   or $0.29 per share.  The Company had previously recorded $37.5 million
   relating to this liability.  This cumulative adjustment as of January
   1, 1992 represents the discounted present value of expected future
   retiree health benefits attributed to employees' service rendered
   prior to that date.  The effect of the change on 1992 net income
   before cumulative effect of accounting change was not material to any
   of the consolidated financial statements.

        The components of the net postretirement health care cost are as
   follows:

              A reconciliation of the accumulated postretirement benefit
   obligation to the liability recognized in the consolidated balance
   sheets is as follows:






        The actuarial calculation assumes a 12% increase in the health
   care cost trend rate for fiscal year 1994.  The assumed rate decreases
   one percent every year through the sixth year to six percent and
   remains constant beyond that point.  The health care cost trend rate
   has a significant effect on the amounts reported.  For example, a one
   percentage point increase in the health care cost trend rate would
   increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $6.0
   million and increase net periodic cost by $0.8 million.  The discount
   rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
   obligation was 8% in 1994, 7.25% in 1993 and 7.75% in 1992.
















































   10)  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND PER SHARE DATA

        The Company's common stock consists of 300.0 million authorized
   shares, with a par value of $1 per share.  Of the total unissued
   common shares at December 31, 1994, total shares in reserve included
   10.1 million shares for issuance under the Company's stock option
   plans.

        Each share of common stock includes a preferred stock purchase
   right (a "Right").  Each Right will entitle the holder, until the
   earlier of October 31, 1998 or the redemption of the Rights, to buy
   one four-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock,
   denominated "Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series B," at a
   price of $25 per one four-hundredth of a share (as adjusted to reflect
   stock splits since the issuance of the Rights).  This preferred stock
   is nonredeemable and will have 100 votes per share.  The Company has
   reserved 500,000 Series B preferred shares for issuance upon exercise
   of such Rights.  The Rights will be exercisable only if a person or
   group acquires 20% or more of voting power of the Company or announces
   a tender offer following which it would hold 30% or more of the
   Company's voting power.

        In the event that any person becomes the beneficial owner of 30%
   or more of the Company's voting power, the Rights (other than Rights
   held by the 30% stockholder) would become exercisable for that number
   of shares of the Company's common stock having a market value of two
   times the exercise price of the Right.  Furthermore, if, following the
   acquisition by a person or group of 20% or more of the Company's
   voting power, the Company were acquired in a merger or other business
   combination or 50% or more of its assets were sold, or in the event of
   certain types of self-dealing transactions by a 20% stockholder, each
   Right (other than Rights held by the 20% stockholder) would become
   exercisable for that number of shares of common stock of the Company
   (or the surviving company in a business combination) having a market
   value of two times the exercise price of the Right.

        The Company may redeem the Rights at one cent per Right prior to
   the occurrence of an event that causes the Rights to become
   exercisable for common stock.  The Board of Directors may terminate
   the Company's right to redeem the Rights under certain circumstances
   at any time after a group or person acquires 20% or more of the
   Company's voting power.

        The earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted
   average monthly number of shares outstanding during the year.  On
   September 1, 1994, a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock
   was effected in the form of a stock dividend of one share of stock on
   each share of stock outstanding at the close of business on August 15,
   1994.









        Accordingly, all share and per share data have been restated to
   retroactively reflect the stock split.  Common stock was credited $1
   and additional paid-in capital was charged a like amount for each
   share of stock issued pursuant to the stock split.






















































   11)  STOCK OPTIONS

        Under the terms of the Company's stock option plans, all options
   are granted at prices at least equal to the market value on the date
   of grant and expire five years, five years and ninety days, ten years,
   or ten years and one day thereafter.

        The following summarizes the changes in number of shares of
   common stock under option:


        Options outstanding on December 31, 1994, are exercisable at an
   average price of $19.11 and expire on various dates from January 22,
   1995 to November 1, 2004.

        At December 31, 1994, there were 7.9 million shares available for
   grant of future options.









   12)  INCOME TAXES

        During 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
   Income Taxes."  The impact of adopting this standard was not material
   to any of the consolidated financial statements of the Company for
   1992.

        The provision for income taxes consists of the following:

              The components of the net deferred tax asset are as follows:











































              No United States deferred taxes have been provided on
   undistributed non-United States subsidiary earnings of $30.5 million,
   which are considered to be permanently invested.

        The non-United States component of income before income taxes was
   $3.5 million in 1994 and $1.8 million in both 1993 and 1992.



































   13)  OTHER NONOPERATING EXPENSES(INCOME)

   14)  OTHER OPERATING INFORMATION

   INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

        Since the beginning of 1993, after the sale of its closures
   business on December 31, 1992, over 90% of the Company's revenues are
   derived from consumer products and, as such, the Company operates in a
   single industry segment.  Prior to 1993, the Company operated in two
   industry segments, Consumer Products and Industrial Products.

        Consumer Products are sold through a variety of retail and
   wholesale distribution channels.  Industrial Products were sold
   directly and through distributors.  Intersegment sales were not
   material.


    GENERAL INFORMATION

        The Company's segment information necessarily includes
   allocations of expenses and assets shared by its segments.  Although
   such allocations were made on a reasonable basis, the assets and
   operating income do not necessarily reflect how such data might appear
   if the segments were operated as separate businesses.

        Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to
   approximately 15% of consolidated sales in 1994, and 14% in both 1993
   and 1992.  Each of the other customers amounted to less than 10% in
   all three years.

        Export sales were less than 10% of consolidated sales in 1994,
   1993 and 1992.

        Total assets are those assets that are used in the Company's
   operations in each industry segment.  Corporate assets are located
   exclusively in the United States and consist principally of cash,
   marketable equity securities, goodwill and notes receivable.  Prior to
   the acquisition of Newell Europe, the Company operated principally in
   the North American geographic segment.







   15)  LITIGATION

        The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain legal
   proceedings and claims, including the environmental matters described
   below, that have arisen in the ordinary conduct of its business. 
   Although management of the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome
   of these matters with certainty, it believes that their ultimate
   resolution will not have a material effect on the Company's
   consolidated financial statements.

        The Company and its subsidiaries are also involved in various
   matters concerning federal and state environmental laws and
   regulations, including seventeen matters in which they have been
   identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain
   state environmental agencies as potentially responsible parties
   ("PRPs") at hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive
   Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("Superfund")
   and equivalent state laws.  In assessing its remediation costs, the
   Company has considered several factors, including:  the extent of the
   Company's volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of
   other PRPs; the kind of waste; where applicable, the terms of existing
   cost sharing and other agreements; the ability of other PRPs to share
   in the payment of requisite costs; the Company's prior experience with
   environmental remediation; environmental studies and cost estimates
   available to the Company; the effects of inflation on cost estimates;
   and the extent to which the Company's and other party's status as a
   PRP is disputed.  Based on information currently available to it, the
   Company's estimate of remediation costs associated with these matters
   ranges between $12.5 million and $17.5 million.  As of December 31,
   1994, the Company had a reserve equal to $14.5 million for such
   remediation costs in the aggregate.  Insufficient information is
   available to the Company to permit it reasonably to reflect any
   unasserted claims in its reserve or cost estimates.  No insurance
   recovery was taken into account in determining the Company's cost
   estimates or reserve nor do the Company's cost estimates or reserve
   reflect any discounting for present value purposes.
