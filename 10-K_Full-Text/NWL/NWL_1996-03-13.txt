                                PART I
Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

     "Newell" or the "Company" refers to Newell Co. alone or with its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, as the context requires.

GENERAL
- -------

     Newell is a manufacturer and full-service marketer of high-volume
consumer products serving the needs of volume purchasers.  The
Company's basic strategy is to merchandise a multi-product offering of
brand-name consumer products, with an emphasis on excellent customer
service, in order to achieve maximum results for its stockholders. 
Each group of the Company's products is manufactured and sold by a
subsidiary or division (each referred to herein as a "division," even
if separately incorporated).

     The Company manages the activities of its divisions through
executives at the corporate level, to whom the divisional managers
report, and controls financial activities through centralized
accounting, capital expenditure reporting, cash management, order
processing, billing, credit, accounts receivable and data processing
operations.  The production and marketing functions of each division,
however, are conducted with substantial independence.  Each division
is managed by employees who make day-to-day operating and sales
decisions and participate in an incentive compensation plan that ties
a significant part of their compensation to their division's return on
assets and sales and income growth.  The Company believes that this
allocation of responsibility and system of incentives fosters an
entrepreneurial approach to management that has been important to the
Company's success.

     This 1995 Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward looking
statements that are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions
of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such forward
looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Exhibit 99
to this 1995 10-K Report identifies important risk factors which could
cause the Company's actual financial results to differ materially from
results forecast or estimated by the Company in forward looking
statements.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
- --------------------------

     Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to
approximately 14% of consolidated sales in 1995, 15% in 1994 and 14%
in 1993.  Sales to each of the Company's other customers,
individually, amounted to less than 10% of consolidated net sales.

     Most of the Company's customers are retailers who rely on a
single or principal source for each of the consumer products that they
sell.  Accordingly, the divisions focus their marketing effort not on
the ultimate consumer, but on the retailer, and compete with other
suppliers for business.  The Company's strategy is to emphasize
excellent customer service, innovative merchandising programs and a
quality multi-product offering.  The Company's computerized order
processing system allows it to receive orders from its customers on a
computer-to-computer basis.  This system, and the ability to fill and
ship orders promptly, are important competitive factors since they
reduce a customer's order processing costs and allow the customer to
minimize the inventory it must carry.  The divisions maintain sales
and service organizations to be responsive to the needs of their
customers.



BACKLOG
- -------

     The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.

SEASONAL VARIATIONS
- -------------------

     The divisions are only moderately affected by seasonal trends. 
Housewares products typically have higher sales in the second half of
the year due to retail stocking related to the holiday season, Home
Furnishings and Hardware products have higher sales in the second and
third quarters due to an increased level of do-it-yourself projects
completed in the summer months and Office Products have higher sales
in the second and third quarters due to the back-to-school season. 
The Company's consolidated quarterly sales do not fluctuate
significantly because these seasonal trends are moderate.



NET SALES BY PRODUCT CLASS
- --------------------------

     The following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of the
Company's net sales for the three years ended December 31, 1995
(including sales of acquired companies only from the time of

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES
- -------------------------------------------

     At the foundation of the Company's growth strategy is
acquisitions.  Since the late 1960s, acquisitions have been the
Company's primary vehicle for growth.  Over the last twenty-five
years, the Company has acquired more than 50 companies.  In the last
five years alone, the Company has completed over 10 major
acquisitions, representing nearly $2 billion in additional sales.

     From a small manufacturer of drapery hardware with about $20
million in sales and $2 million in net income in the late 1960's,
Newell has grown almost 20% per year and is now an international
consumer goods supplier with annualized sales approaching $3 billion
and net income exceeding $220 million.  This dramatic growth is
largely the result of acquisitions, supplemented by internal growth
from existing and acquired product lines, as the vehicle to execute a
multi-product offering strategy. 

     In its acquisition planning, the Company looks for branded,
staple product lines sold to volume purchasers.  These product lines
must have the potential to reach the Company's high standard of
profitability, have a low technology level and a long product life
cycle.  In addition to adding entirely new product lines, acquisitions
can be beneficial in rounding out existing businesses by filling gaps
in the product offering, adding new customers and distribution
channels and improving operational efficiency through shared
resources.

     The Company has typically acquired companies that it believes
have  unrealized profit potential.  "Newellization" is the profit
improvement and productivity enhancement process that is applied to
newly acquired product lines to bring  them up to the Company's
standards of profitability.

     Elements of the Newellization process at newly acquired companies
include establishing a focused business strategy, improving customer
service, building partnerships with customers, reducing corporate
overhead through centralization of administrative functions, trimming
excess costs, tightening financial controls, improving manufacturing
efficiency, pruning nonproductive product lines and reducing
inventories, increasing trade receivable turnover and improving sales
mix profitability through the application of program merchandising
techniques.

     As part of the Newellization process to improve profitability,
sales can often decline as unprofitable product lines are reduced or
eliminated.  In the Newell strategy, once a company has been
Newellized (the process usually takes about two years), it is expected
to begin building profitable sales and contribute to the Company's
internal sales growth.



     Additional information regarding acquisitions and divestitures of
businesses is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS
- ------------------

     Prior to the November 1994 acquisition of Newell Europe and the
November 1995 acquisition of Berol, the Company operated almost
entirely in the United States and Canada.  Following these
acquisitions, the Company operates in several non-U.S. locations,
including England, France, Germany, Mexico and Colombia.  Summary
financial information by geographic area included in the consolidated

RAW MATERIAL
- ------------

     The Company expects to have multiple foreign and domestic sources
of supply for substantially all of its material requirements.  The raw
materials and various purchased components required for its products
have generally been available in sufficient quantities.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
- ----------------------

none of which is considered material to the consolidated operations.

COMPETITION
- -----------

     The markets in which the Company competes are highly competitive,
with a number of well-established domestic and foreign manufacturers. 
In addition, many of the Company's products compete with a number of
substitute products.  The Company believes, however, that it has a
significant share in many of its markets.

     The Company's principal methods of competition are customer
service, price, brand name identification, merchandising programs,
domestic manufacturing resources and breadth of product line
offerings.  The Company believes that its customer service programs,
which include computer-to-computer EDI capabilities and Quick Response
programs, are superior to programs offered by many of its competitors. 
The Company also believes customers are positively influenced by
previous experience with the Company, which includes delivery of
quality products on time and complete and innovative good-better-best
merchandising programs.  The Company's principal customers are
sophisticated volume purchasers, which consider a combination of all
of these factors in determining where to purchase products.

ENVIRONMENT
- -----------

     The Company is subject to various laws regulating the discharge
of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment.  Regulation in this area is still
developing, including changes in the standards of enforcement of
existing laws and enactment of new laws.  Although the Company, like
other companies engaged in similar businesses, is a party to various
proceedings relating to environmental matters and makes capital
expenditures for environmental projects, it does not believe it will
have material capital expenditures for environmental control
facilities during the current or succeeding fiscal year.  See note 14
to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of
the environmental matters in which the Company has been identified as
a potentially responsible party, which is hereby incorporated by
reference.

     The Company has approximately 23,000 employees, of whom
approximately 6,300 are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 



Item 2.  Properties

      The following table shows the location and general character of the
principal operating facilities owned or leased by the Company.  The executive

     On February 14, 1992, the Company acquired Sanford Corporation
("Sanford"), a designer, manufacturer and marketer of marking and
writing instruments, plastic desk accessories, file storage boxes and
other office and school supplies.  The Company issued approximately
13.8 million shares of common stock for all the common stock of
Sanford.  This transaction was accounted for as a pooling of
interests; therefore, prior financial statements were restated to
reflect this merger.

     On July 8, 1992, the Company acquired Stuart Hall Company, Inc.
("Stuart Hall"), a manufacturer of school supplies, stationery and

in cash.  These transactions were accounted for as purchases;
therefore, the results of operations for Stuart Hall and Intercraft
are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
since their respective dates of acquisition.  The cost of these 1992
acquisitions was allocated to the fair market value of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed and resulted in trade names and goodwill of

     These transactions were accounted for as purchases.  The results
are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
since their respective dates of acquisition.  The cost of the 1993
acquisitions was allocated to the fair market value of assets acquired

     On August 29, 1994, the Company acquired Home Fashions,
Inc.("HFI"), a manufacturer and marketer of decorative window
coverings, including vertical blinds and pleated shades sold under the

maker and marketer of markers and writing instruments, including wood-

distribution network throughout these areas (Pyrex and Visions are
registered trademarks of Corning Incorporated).  Additionally, the
Company became the distributor in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
for Corning's U.S.-manufactured cookware and dinnerware brands.  The
purchase price was $87.8 million in cash.  

     These transactions were accounted for as purchases.  The results
of operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements since their respective dates of acquisition.  The cost of
the 1994 acquisitions was allocated to the fair market value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted in trade names and
goodwill of approximately $197.8 million.  The allocations of cost
were completed in 1995 with no material adjustments to the financial
statements.

     On September 29, 1995, the Company acquired Decorel Incorporated
("Decorel"), a manufacturer and marketer of ready-made picture frames. 
The purchase price was $29.6 million in cash.  On November 2, 1995,
the Company acquired Berol Corporation ("Berol"), a designer,
manufacturer and marketer of markers and writing instruments.  The

combined into Sanford. 

     These transactions were accounted for as purchases.  The results
of operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements since their respective dates of acquisition.  The cost of
the 1995 acquisitions was allocated on a preliminary basis to the fair
market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted
in trade names and goodwill of approximately $188.3 million.  The



final adjustments to the purchase price allocations are not expected
to be material to the financial statements.

ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 on a pro forma basis, as though
Berol, Decorel, Eberhard Faber, HFI and Newell Europe each had been

(1)  In August 1994, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-
for-one common stock split in the form of a 100% stock distribution of
the Company's common stock, which was paid on September 1, 1994 to
stockholders of record on August 15, 1994.  All per share data was
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

(2)  In 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers" Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions."  Adoption of this
standard did not have a material effect on the annual expense for
postretirement benefits.  As part of adopting this standard, the
Company recorded, in the first quarter of 1992, a one-time, non-cash
charge against earnings of $71.7 million before taxes and $44.1
million after taxes, or $0.29 per share.  The effect of the charge on
1992 net income before cumulative effect of accounting change was not
material to the consolidated financial statements.

(3)  On December 31, 1992, the Company sold its closures business for
a $210.0 million note receivable due and paid January 4, 1993.  The
Company recognized a net pre-tax gain of $82.9 million on the sale. 
Sales for this business totaled $160.6 million in 1992.

1995 vs. 1994

     Net sales for 1995 were $2,498.4 million, representing an
increase of $423.5 million or 20.4% from 1994.  Net sales for each of
the Company's product groups (and the primary reasons for the
increases) were as follows, in millions:

                   ========     ========       ====

      The overall increase in net sales was primarily attributable to
the 1995 acquisitions of Decorel and Berol, and the 1994 acquisitions
of HFI, Eberhard Faber and Newell Europe (all of which are described
in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).  Internal sales
growth is defined as growth from continuing businesses owned more than
two years ("core businesses"), including minor acquisitions.  Internal
sales growth was lower than expected in 1995 due to a sluggish retail
environment.

     Gross income as a percent of net sales for 1995 was 31.3% versus
32.3% in 1994.  The decrease was due to lower than average gross
margins from the businesses acquired in 1994 and 1995.

     SG&A as a percent of net sales in 1995 was 14.5% versus 15.1% in
1994.  The decrease was due to lower spending at the Company's core
businesses and low levels of SG&A at Eberhard Faber.



     Net nonoperating expenses for 1995 were $48.7 million in 1995
versus $28.6 million in 1994.  Net nonoperating expenses are
summarized as follows, in millions:

(1)  Increase was due to the 1994 and 1995 cash acquisitions which
     were funded with increased debt.

(2)  During the second quarter, the Company initiated a plan to
     dispose of the foreign investment and has reduced its investment
     to the net realizable value.

     The effective tax rate was 40.0% in 1995 and 40.6% in 1994.  See
note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of
the effective tax rate.

     Net income for 1995 was $222.5 million, representing an increase
of $26.9 million or 13.8% from 1994.  Earnings per share for 1995 were
up 13.7% to $1.41 versus $1.24 in 1994.  The increases in net income
and earnings per share were primarily attributable to contributions
from the 1994 and 1995 acquisitions and increased operating margins at
core businesses, net of increases in net nonoperating expenses.



1994 vs. 1993:

     Net sales for 1994 were $2,074.9 million, representing an

      The overall increase in net sales was primarily attributable to
the 1993 acquisitions of Levolor, Lee Rowan and Goody and the 1994
acquisitions of HFI and Eberhard Faber (all of which are described in
note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), and internal sales
growth.  "Sold Businesses" represents the sales in 1993 of Counselor,
which was divested in October 1993.

     Gross income as a percent of net sales for 1994 was 32.3% versus
33.0% in 1993.  The decrease was due to lower than average gross
margins from the businesses acquired in 1993 and 1994.

     SG&A as a percent of net sales in 1994 was 15.1% versus 15.6% in
1993.  The decrease was due to internal sales growth, with only slight
increases in spending.

     Net nonoperating expenses for 1994 were $28.6 million versus
$10.6  million in 1993.  Net nonoperating expenses are summarized as

(1) Increase was due to the 1993 and 1994 cash acquisitions which were
funded primarily with debt.

     The effective tax rate was 40.6% in 1994 and 40.0% in 1993.  See
note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of
the effective tax rate.

     Net income for 1994 was $195.6 million, representing an increase
of $30.3 million or 18.3% from 1993.  Earnings per share for 1994 were
up 18.1% to $1.24 versus $1.05 in 1993.  The increases in net income
and earnings per share were primarily attributable to contributions
from the 1993 acquisitions and internal sales growth, net of increases
in net nonoperating expenses.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital resources
include cash provided from operations and use of available borrowing
facilities.

     Operating activities provided net cash of $276.7 million during
1995, an increase of $38.3 million from $238.4 million in 1994.  This
change was primarily due to the increase in net income and
depreciation and amortization.

     The Company has short-term foreign and domestic lines of credit
with various banks and a commercial paper program which are available
for short-term financing.  Under the line of credit arrangements, the
Company may borrow up to $280.2 million (of which $170.7 million was
available at December 31, 1995) based upon such terms as the Company
and the respective banks have mutually agreed upon.  Committed lines
of credit compose $134.5 million of the total line of credit



arrangements.  Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines of
credit are subject to the discretion of the lender.

     At December 31, 1995 the Company had outstanding $345.0 million
(principal amount) of medium-term notes with maturities ranging from
one to five years at an average rate of interest equal to 6.3%.  The
Company had outstanding $186.0 million on December 31, 1994 and $153.0
million of medium-term notes on December 31, 1993.

     In June 1995, the Company entered into a five-year $550.0 million
revolving credit agreement and a $200.0 million, 364-day revolving
credit agreement (and terminated its existing revolving credit
agreements).  Under these agreements, the Company may borrow, repay
and reborrow funds in an aggregate amount up to $750.0 million, at a
floating interest rate.  At December 31, 1995, there were no
borrowings under the revolving credit agreements.

     In lieu of borrowings under the revolving credit agreements, the
Company may issue up to $750.0 million of commercial paper.  The
Company's revolving credit agreements referred to above provide the
committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. 
Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount
available under the Company's revolving credit agreements.  At
December 31, 1995, $448.6 million (face or principal amount) of
commercial paper was outstanding, all of which was supported by the
five-year revolving credit agreements.  The entire amount is
classified as long-term debt.

     As of January 23, 1996, the Company has a universal shelf
registration statement under which the Company may issue up to $500
million of debt and equity securities, subject to market conditions.

     The Company's primary uses of liquidity and capital resources
include capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions.

     Capital expenditures were $82.6 million, $66.0 million and $58.9
million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     The Company has paid regular cash dividends on its common stock
since 1947.  On May 11, 1995, the quarterly cash dividend was
increased to $0.12 per share from the $0.10 per share that had been
paid since May 12, 1994.  Dividends paid during 1995, 1994 and 1993
were $72.8 million, $61.5 million and $54.3 million, respectively.  In
August 1994, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
common stock split in the form of a 100% stock distribution of the
Company's common stock, which was paid on September 1, 1994 to
stockholders of record on August 15, 1994.  All per share data has
been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split.

     Retained earnings increased in 1995, 1994 and 1993 by $149.7
million, $134.0 million and $111.1 million, respectively.  The average
dividend payout ratio to common stockholders in 1995, 1994 and 1993
was 33%, 31% and 33%, respectively.



     In 1995, the Company acquired Decorel, Berol and completed other
minor acquisitions for $203.9 million.  In 1994 and 1993, the Company
completed acquisitions with a total cost of $362.8 million and $332.1
million, respectively.  All of these acquisitions were accounted for
as purchases and were paid for with proceeds obtained from the
issuance of commercial paper, medium-term notes, notes payable under
the Company's lines of credit or  shares of the Company's common
stock.

     The increases in current assets, current liabilities, property,
plant and equipment and trade names and goodwill during 1995, 1994 and
1993 were primarily due to the acquisitions occurring in those years.

     Working capital at December 31, 1995 was $452.6 million compared
to $133.6 million at December 31, 1994 and $76.7 million at December
31, 1993.  The current ratio at December 31, 1995 was 1.67:1 compared
to 1.17:1 at December 31, 1994 and 1.13:1 at December 31, 1993.  The
working capital and current ratio increased in 1995 as a result of
increased current assets related to acquired businesses coupled with
lower levels of short-term debt. Total debt to total capitalization
(net of cash and cash equivalents) was .40:1 at December 31, 1995,
 .38:1 at December 31, 1994 and .32:1 at December 31, 1993.

     The Company believes that cash provided from operations and
available borrowing facilities will continue to provide adequate
support for the cash needs of existing businesses; however, certain
events, such as significant acquisitions, could require additional
external financing. 

     In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of."  This statement has not been
adopted by the Company and management believes that the adoption of
this statement in 1996 will not be material to the consolidated
financial statements.

     In 1995, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation".  The Company will adopt this statement in 1996
which will require additional disclosures in the footnotes to the
consolidated financial statements.  Management believes the adoption
of this statement will not be material to the consolidated financial
statements.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     The Company is involved in various environmental remediation and
other compliance activities, including activities arising under the
federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act ("Superfund") and similar state statutes.  Certain
information regarding these activities is included in note 14 to the
consolidated financial statements.  Based on information currently
available to it, the Company has estimated that remediation costs



associated with these activities will be between $11.0 million and
$15.6 million.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company had a reserve
equal to $13.8 million for such remediation costs in the aggregate. 
Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment
and remediation activities, the possibility that sites could be
identified in the future that require environmental remediation and
the possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses
acquired, actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from the
Company's estimates.  Subject to difficulties in estimating future
environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any sums it may
have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of
amounts reserved will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial statements. 

Outlook
- -------

     The Company's primary financial goals are to maintain return on
beginning equity at 20% or above and increase earnings per share
("EPS") an average of 15% per year, while maintaining a prudent ratio
of total debt to total capital ("leverage").  The Company has achieved
these goals over the last ten years, averaging 21% ROE, increasing EPS
20% and averaging 26% leverage.  The factors affecting the Company's
ability to achieve these goals in the future will be the rates of
internal and acquisition growth.

     In terms of internal growth, the Company has achieved an average
of 5% internal sales growth over the last five years, and at the same
time, has improved its core business operating margins.  Internal
sales growth has been under pressure recently, however, as a result of
a sluggish retail environment and continuing competition and
consolidation among the Company's volume purchasers.  Over the longer
term, economic trends will continue to affect the Company's internal
growth prospects.

     In terms of acquisition growth, since 1990 the Company has more
than doubled its size, acquiring businesses with annual sales of
almost $2 billion.  The rate at which the Company can integrate these
recent acquisitions, in order to meet the Company's high standards of
profitability, may affect near-term EPS growth.  Over the longer term,
the Company's ability to make and integrate strategic acquisitions
will impact the EPS growth rate.



Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
- ----------------------------------------------------

Report of Independent Public Accountants
- ----------------------------------------

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Newell Co.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newell
Co. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995,
1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1995.  These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of Newell Co.'s management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newell Co.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in Part IV
Item 14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K is presented for purposes of complying
with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not a part
of the basic financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected
to the auditing procedures applied in our audit of the basic financial
statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects
the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the
basic financial statements taken as a whole.

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                   DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1994 AND 1993


1)   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Principles of Consolidation:  The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Newell and its majority owned
subsidiaries ("the Company") after elimination of intercompany
accounts and transactions.

     Use of estimates:  The preparation of these financial statements
required the use of certain estimates by management in determining the
Company's assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related
disclosures.

     Revenue Recognition:  Sales of merchandise are recognized upon
shipment to customers.

     Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments:

     Long-term Investments:  The fair value of the investment in
     convertible  preferred stock of the Black & Decker Corporation
     ("Black & Decker") was based on an independent appraisal.

     Long-term Debt:  The fair value of the Company's long-term debt
     issued under the medium-term note program is estimated based on
     quoted market prices which approximate cost.  All other
     significant long-term debt are floating rate instruments whose
     carrying amounts approximate fair value.

     Derivatives:  Premiums paid related to interest rate swap
agreements are amortized into interest expense over the terms of the
agreements.  Unamortized premiums are included in other assets in the
consolidated balance sheets.

     Gains and losses relating to qualifying hedges of firm
commitments are deferred and are recognized in income as adjustments
of carrying amounts when the hedged transaction occurs.

     Allowances for Doubtful Accounts:  Allowances for doubtful
accounts at December 31, totalled $11.0 million in 1995, $10.9 million
in 1994 and $6.2 million in 1993.

     Inventories:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market value.  Cost of certain domestic inventories (approximately
89%, 87% and 83% of total inventories at December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively) was determined by the "last-in, first-out"
("LIFO") method; for the balance, cost was determined using the
"first-in" first-out"("FIFO") method.



     If the FIFO inventory valuation method had been used exclusively,
inventories would have been increased by $29.0 million, $12.3 million
and $9.2 million at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

     The components of inventories at the end of each year, net of the
LIFO reserve, were as follows:

                                               December 31, 
                                          1995     1994      1993
                                         ------   ------    ------
                                            (In millions)

     Materials and supplies              $147.7   $ 81.7    $ 71.3
     Work in process                       87.5     98.9      49.6
     Finished products                    274.0    240.1     180.1
                                         ------   ------    ------
                                         $509.2   $420.7    $301.0
                                          =====    =====     =====

     Reserves for excess and obsolete inventories at December 31
totalled $37.5 million in 1995, $27.0 million in 1994 and $19.3
million in 1993.

     Long-term Marketable Equity Securities:  Long-term marketable
equity securities at the end of each year are summarized as follows:

                                               December 31, 
                                          1995     1994      1993
                                         ------   ------    ------
                                            (In millions)

     Aggregate market value              $ 53.3   $ 64.7    $ 54.6
     Aggregate cost                        26.8     48.3      49.0
                                         ------   ------    ------
     Unrealized gain                     $ 26.5   $ 16.4    $  5.6
                                         ======   ======    ======

     Beginning January 1, 1994, long-term marketable equity securities
are carried at fair value with adjustments for fair value reported
separately as a component of stockholders' equity and excluded from
earnings.

     During 1995, the Company received proceeds of $37.3 million from
the sale of long-term marketable securities and recorded a gain of
$15.8 million on the sale.  Gains and losses on the sales of long-term
marketable securities are based upon the average cost of securities
sold.

     Other Long-Term Investments:  The Company owns 150,000 shares of
privately placed Black & Decker convertible preferred stock, Series B,
purchased at a cost of $150.0 million.  The Series B preferred shares
pay a 7 3/4% cumulative dividend, are convertible into Black & Decker
common stock at $23.62 per share, and have voting rights equivalent to



the common stock into which they are convertible.  These shares have
restrictions on disposition by the Company, and Black & Decker has the
option during the 90-day period beginning September 15, 2001, to
repurchase the remaining preferred shares and any common stock issued
upon conversion then held by the Company.  The estimated fair value of
this investment was $244.5 million at December 31, 1995. 

     The Company has a 49% ownership interest in American Tool
Companies, Inc., a manufacturer of hand tools and power tool accessory
products marketed primarily under the VISE-GRIP and IRWIN trademarks. 
This investment is accounted for on the equity method with a net
investment of $39.2 million included in Other Long-Term Investments at
December 31, 1995.

     Accounting Principles to be Adopted:  In 1995, the Financial
Accounting standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 121, "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed of."  This statement has not been adopted by the Company
and management believes that the adoption of this statement in 1996
will not be material to the consolidated financial statements.  

     In 1995, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation."  The Company will adopt this statement in 1996
which will require additional disclosures in the footnotes to the
consolidated financial statements.  Management believes the adoption
of this statement will not be material to the consolidated financial
statements.



     Property, Plant and Equipment:  Property, plant and equipment at
the end of each year consisted of the following:

                                                December 31, 

                                           1995     1994      1993

     Land                                $  16.2  $   9.6   $   7.1
     Buildings and improvements            194.8    164.8     136.5
     Machinery and equipment               647.8    515.8     419.1
                                           ------   ------    ------
                                           858.8    690.2     562.7  
     Allowance for depreciation           (328.5)  (235.6)   (192.3)
                                           ------   ------    ------
                                         $ 530.3  $ 454.6   $ 370.4
                                           ======   ======    ======

     The components of depreciation are provided by annual charges to
income calculated to amortize, principally on the straight-line basis,
the cost of the depreciable assets over their depreciable lives. 
Estimated useful lives determined by the Company are as follows:

          Buildings and improvements     20-40 years

          Machinery and equipment         5-12 years 

Replacements and improvements are capitalized.  Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense.

     Trade Names and Goodwill:  Trade names and the excess of cost
over identifiable net assets of businesses acquired are being
amortized over 40 years on a straight-line basis.  Accumulated
amortization of trade names and goodwill was $76.3 million, $57.0
million and $42.1 million at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

     Subsequent to an acquisition, the Company periodically evaluates
whether later events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the
remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant revision or
that the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable.  When
factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for possible
impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the relevant business
unit's undiscounted net income over the remaining life of the goodwill
in measuring whether the goodwill is recoverable.



     Accrued Liabilities:  Accrued liabilities at the end of each year
included the following:
                                                December 31, 

                                           1995     1994      1993
                                           -----    ----      -----
                                                (In millions)

     Promotion accruals                   $ 82.6   $ 74.9    $ 53.4

     Accrued self-insurance liability       39.7     38.7      36.1

     The self-insurance accrual is primarily for workers' compensation
and is estimated based upon historical claim experience.

     Foreign Currency Translation:  Foreign currency translation gains
and losses were insignificant in 1995, 1994 and 1993.

     Reclassification:  Certain 1993 and 1994 amounts have been
reclassified to conform with the 1995 presentation.


2)   ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES

- -----

     On April 30, 1993, the Company acquired substantially all of the

     These transactions were accounted for as purchases.  The results
of operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financial

the 1993 acquisitions was allocated to the fair market value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted in trade names and
goodwill of approximately $208.2 million.



- -----

     On August 29, 1994, the Company acquired Home Fashions, Inc.
("HFI"), a manufacturer and marketer of decorative window coverings,
including vertical blinds and pleated shades sold under the Del Mar

cash.  This company was combined with Levolor and together they are
operated as a single entity called Levolor Home Fashions.  On October
18, 1994, the Company acquired Faber-Castell Corporation, a maker and
marketer of markers and writing instruments, including wood-cased

business of Corning Incorporated (now known as "Newell Europe").  This
acquisition included Corning's consumer products manufacturing
facilities in England, France and Germany, the European trademark
rights and product lines for Pyrex, Pyroflam and Visions brands in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Corning's consumer
distribution network throughout these areas (Pyrex and Visions are
registered trademarks of Corning Incorporated).  Additionally, the
Company became the distributor in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
for Corning's U.S.-manufactured cookware and dinnerware brands.  The
purchase price was $87.8 million in cash.  

     These transactions were accounted for as purchases.  The results
of operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements since their respective dates of acquisition.  The cost of
the 1994 acquisitions was allocated to the fair market value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted in trade names and
goodwill of approximately $197.8 million.  The allocations of cost
were completed in 1995 with no material adjustments to the financial
statements.

- -----

     On September 29, 1995, the Company acquired Decorel Incorporated
("Decorel"), a manufacturer and marketer of ready-made picture frames. 
The purchase price was $29.6 million in cash.  On November 2, 1995,
the Company acquired Berol Corporation ("Berol"), a designer,
manufacturer and marketer of markers and writing instruments.  The
purchase price was $118.8 million in cash.  This company will be
combined into Sanford.

     These transactions were accounted for as purchases.  The results
of operations are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements since their respective dates of acquisition.  The cost of
the 1995 acquisitions was allocated on a preliminary basis to the fair
market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted
in trade names and goodwill of approximately $188.3 million.  The



total adjustments to the purchase price allocation are not expected to
be material to the financial statements.    



     The unaudited consolidated results of operations for the years
ended December 31, 1995 and 1994 on a pro forma basis, as though
Berol, Decorel, HFI, Eberhard Faber and Newell Europe each had been
acquired on January 1, 1994, are as follows:

     Earnings per share                  1.38           1.24


3)   CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

     The Company has short-term foreign and domestic lines of credit
with various banks.  Under the line of credit arrangements, the
Company may borrow U.S. or foreign currencies up to $280.2 million (of
which $170.7 million was available at December 31, 1995) based upon
such terms as the Company and the respective banks have mutually
agreed upon.  Committed lines of credit compose $134.5 million of the
total line of credit arrangements.  Borrowings under the Company's
uncommitted lines of credit are subject to the discretion of the
lender.  Compensating balances on the Company's foreign and domestic
lines of credit are not material.



     The following is a summary of borrowings under foreign and
domestic lines of credit:

consolidated financial statements, provide the committed backup
liquidity required to issue commercial paper.  The entire amount of
commercial paper is classified as long-term under the five-year
revolving credit agreement.  The following is a summary of commercial

                                       ======     ======      ======

     At December 31, 1995, the Company had outstanding $345.0 million
(principal amount) of medium-term notes with maturities ranging from
one to five years at an average rate of interest equal to 6.3%.

     In June 1995, the Company entered into a five-year $550.0 million
revolving credit agreement and a $200.0 million, 364-day revolving
credit agreement (and terminated its existing revolving credit
agreements).  Under these agreements, the Company may borrow, repay
and reborrow funds in an aggregate amount up to $750.0 million, at a
floating interest rate.  At December 31, 1995, there were no
borrowings under the revolving credit agreements.

     In lieu of borrowings under the revolving credit agreements, the
Company may issue up to $750.0 million of commercial paper.  The
Company's revolving credit agreements referred to above provide the
committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper. 
Accordingly, commercial paper may only be issued up to the amount
available under the Company's revolving credit agreements.  At
December 31, 1995, $448.6 million (face or principal amount) of
commercial paper was outstanding, all of which was supported by the
five-year revolving credit agreement.  The entire amount is classified
as long-term debt.

     The revolving credit agreements permit the Company to borrow
funds using Syndicated loans (Base Rate loans or Eurodollar loans),



Money Market loans (LIBOR Market loans or Set Rate loans) or
Acceptance liabilities, as selected by the Company.  The terms of
these agreements require, among other things, that the Company
maintain a certain Total Debt to Total Capital Ratio and a minimum
Operating Income to Interest Expense Ratio, all capitalized terms as
defined in these agreements.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company was
in compliance with these agreements.

     The aggregate maturities of long-term debt outstanding at
December 31, 1995, are as follows:

                       Year        Aggregate Maturities
                       ----        --------------------

     As of January 23, 1996, the Company has a universal shelf
registration statement under which the Company may issue up to $500
million of debt and equity securities, subject to market conditions.


5)   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. 
They are used to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency
risks. 

     Interest rate swap agreements are utilized to convert certain
floating rate debt instruments into fixed rate debt or to convert
certain floating rate debt based on federal funds rates to floating
rate debt based upon commercial paper rates.  As of December 31, 1995,
the Company was party to two interest rate swap agreements which
terminate in June 1996 and June 1998, respectively.  The first
agreement requires the Company to pay on a monthly basis the amounts
by which the commercial paper rate exceeds the Federal Funds rate on
$50.0 million of debt.  The second agreement has a principal value of
$100.0 million and converts one month LIBOR rate debt into fixed rate
debt with a rate of 5.5%.

     The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge certain
purchase commitments denominated in currencies other than the domestic
currency (primarily Japanese yen and U.S. dollar for the Company's



Canadian subsidiary).  As of December 31, 1995, the Company had no
forward exchange contracts outstanding.

     The Company does not obtain collateral or other security to
support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the
credit standing of the counterparties.  The market value of all the
Company's derivatives approximates their carrying values.


6)   LEASES

     The Company has minimum rental payments through the year 2007
under noncancellable operating leases as follows:



                 Year            Minimum Payments
                 ----            ----------------

                 1996                  $25.1

                 1997                   18.5

                 1998                   11.8

                 1999                    7.5

                                       =====


     Total rental expense for all operating leases was approximately
$38.3 million, $31.8 million and $26.0 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.


7)   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS

     The Company and its subsidiaries have noncontributory pension and
profit sharing plans covering substantially all of its foreign and
domestic employees.  Pension plan benefits are generally based on
years of service and/or compensation.  The Company's funding policy is
to contribute not less than the minimum amounts required by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or local statutes to
assure that plan assets will be adequate to provide retirement
benefits.  Due to the overfunded status of most of the pension plans,
contributions to these plans were insignificant during the past three
years.



     The net periodic pension cost components for the pension plans
are as follows:

8)   RETIREE HEALTH CARE

     Several of the Company's subsidiaries currently provide retiree
health care benefits for certain employee groups. 

     The components of the net postretirement health care cost are as

      The actuarial calculation assumes an 11% increase in the health
care cost trend rate for fiscal year 1995.  The assumed rate decreases
one percent every year through the sixth year to six percent and
remains constant beyond that point.  The health care cost trend rate
has a significant effect on the amounts reported.  For example, a one
percentage point increase in the health care cost trend rate would
increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $6.2
million and increase net periodic cost by $.8 million.  The discount



rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 7.75% in 1995, 8% in 1994 and 7.25% in 1993.


9)   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND PER SHARE DATA

     The Company's common stock consists of 400.0 million authorized
shares, with a par value of $1 per share.  Of the total unissued
common shares at December 31, 1995, total shares in reserve included
8.9 million shares for issuance under the Company's stock option
plans.

     Each share of common stock includes a preferred stock purchase
right (a "Right").  Each Right will entitle the holder, until the
earlier of October 31, 1998 or the redemption of the Rights, to buy
one four-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock,
denominated "Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series B," at a
price of $25 per one four-hundredth of a share (as adjusted to reflect
stock splits since the issuance of the Rights).  This preferred stock
is nonredeemable and will have 100 votes per share.  The Company has
reserved 500,000 Series B preferred shares for issuance upon exercise
of such Rights.  The Rights will be exercisable only if a person or
group acquires 20% or more of voting power of the Company or announces
a tender offer following which it would hold 30% or more of the
Company's voting power.

     In the event that any person becomes the beneficial owner of 30%
or more of the Company's voting power, the Rights (other than Rights
held by the 30% stockholder) would become exercisable for that number
of shares of the Company's common stock having a market value of two
times the exercise price of the Right.  Furthermore, if, following the
acquisition by a person or group of 20% or more of the Company's
voting power, the Company were acquired in a merger or other business
combination or 50% or more of its assets were sold, or in the event of
certain types of self-dealing transactions by a 20% stockholder, each
Right (other than Rights held by the 20% stockholder) would become
exercisable for that number of shares of common stock of the Company
(or the surviving company in a business combination) having a market
value of two times the exercise price of the Right.

     The Company may redeem the Rights at one cent per Right prior to
the occurrence of an event that causes the Rights to become
exercisable for common stock.  The Board of Directors may terminate
the Company's right to redeem the Rights under certain circumstances
at any time after a group or person acquires 20% or more of the
Company's voting power.

     The earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted
average monthly number of shares outstanding during the year.

14)  LITIGATION

     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain legal
proceedings and claims, including the environmental matters described
below, that have arisen in the ordinary conduct of its business. 
Although management of the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome
of these matters with certainty, it believes that their ultimate
resolution will not have a material effect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various matters
concerning federal and state environmental laws and regulations,
including seventeen matters in which they have been identified by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental
agencies as potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") at hazardous
waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,



Compensation and Liability Act ("Superfund") and equivalent state
laws.  In assessing its remediation costs, the Company has considered
several factors, including:  the extent of the Company's volumetric
contribution at each site relative to that of other PRPs; the kind of
waste; where applicable, the terms of existing cost sharing and other
agreements; the ability of other PRPs to share in the payment of
requisite costs; the Company's prior experience with environmental
remediation; environmental studies and cost estimates available to the
Company; the effects of inflation on cost estimates; and the extent to
which the Company's and other party's status as a PRP is disputed. 
Based on information currently available to it, the Company's estimate
of remediation costs associated with these matters ranges between
$11.0 million and $15.6 million.  As of December 31, 1995, the Company
had a reserve equal to $13.8 million for such remediation costs in the
aggregate.  No insurance recovery was taken into account in
determining the Company's cost estimates or reserve nor do the
Company's cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for
present value purposes.
