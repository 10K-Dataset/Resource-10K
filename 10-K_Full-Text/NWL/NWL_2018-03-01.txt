GENERAL

Newell Brands is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that help people make life better every day, where they live, learn, work and play. Our
products are marketed under a strong portfolio of leading brands, including Paper Mate

®

, Sharpie

®

, Dymo

®

, EXPO

®

, Parker

®

,
Elmer’s

®

, Coleman

®

, Jostens

, Waddington and Yankee Candle

®

. The Company sells its products in
nearly 200 countries around the world and has operations on the ground in nearly 100 of these countries.

During 2017, the Company continued to execute
the Growth Game Plan, the multi-year strategy that was updated in late 2016 for the new broader portfolio. The Growth Game Plan enables the simplification of the organization and frees up resources to invest in growth initiatives and strengthened
capabilities in support of the Company’s brands. The changes being implemented in the execution of the Growth Game Plan are considered key enablers to building a more profitable and cash flow generative company, with global reach.

As part of the Growth Game Plan, the Company has transformed from a holding company to an operating company, consolidating its 32 business units into 16
global divisions while investing to extend its design, innovation, brand development and

E-commerce

capabilities across a broader set of categories. The new global divisions are the key commercial nodes in the
Company, including a Global

E-commerce

division with responsibility for all

E-commerce

activity across the enterprise. The divisions generally align to the four areas of
strategic focus for the Company of Live, Learn, Work, and Play. The new structure became effective January 1, 2017.

During 2017, the Company
acquired Smith Mountain, a leading provider of premium home fragrance products, sold primarily under the WoodWick

®

Candle brand; Sistema Plastics, a leading provider of food storage and
beverage containers in Australia, New Zealand, U.K, and parts of Europe; and Chesapeake Bay Candle, a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of premium candles and other home fragrance products, focused on consumer wellness and natural
fragrance.

During 2016, the Company committed to plans to divest several other businesses and brands to strengthen the portfolio to better align and
focus the portfolio for growth and margin development. To that end, during 2017 the Company sold its Tools business, its Rubbermaid

®

consumer storage totes business, its stroller business
under the Teutonia

®

brand, its Lehigh business, its firebuilding business, its triathlon apparel business under the Zoot

®

and Squadra

®

brands and its Winter Sports business.

In January 2018, Newell Brands announced that it will
explore a series of strategic initiatives to accelerate its transformation plan, improve operational performance, reduce debt and leverage and enhance shareholder value. The Company is planning on focusing its portfolio on core consumer divisions.
The Company is exploring strategic options for industrial and commercial product assets, including Waddington, Process Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Mapa, as well as several smaller consumer businesses, including Rawlings, Goody,
Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage, and U.S. Playing Cards. The accelerated transformation plan would significantly reduce operational and systems complexity, exposure to economic cycles and resin commodities and focus the Company’s
remaining portfolio on leading brands in global consumer-facing categories that can leverage Newell Brands’ advantaged capabilities in brands, innovation, design and

E-commerce.



STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

Newell Brands is committed to building leading brands through understanding the needs of consumers and using those insights to create innovative, highly
differentiated product solutions that offer superior performance and value. The Company intends to continue to leverage its portfolio of leading brands to create a margin structure that allows for further increases in brand investment.

During 2016, the Company launched the Growth Game Plan, which is its strategy to simplify the organization and free up resources to invest in growth
initiatives and strengthened capabilities in support of the Company’s brands. The changes being implemented in the execution of the Growth Game Plan are considered key enablers to building a bigger, faster-growing, more global and more
profitable company.

The Growth Game Plan encompasses the following strategic elements:

The Newell Brands Vision

The Newell Brands vision for
the Company is grounded in three core characteristics of the business: its geographic reach with sales in nearly 200 countries and territories, its presence in a broad set of large growing household product categories, and its portfolio of leading
brands that make a difference in the lives of consumers every day. The Company asserts that it impacts lives through the broad geographic reach of its business system, through its category presence and leading brands that touch consumers at home, in
school, at work, and where they play. The Company’s vision is that

Newell Brands makes life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day, where they live, learn, work, and play

.

The Newell Brands DNA and Ambition

The Newell Brands DNA
represents an aspirational set of behaviors that define the culture the company aspires to create. The Newell Brands DNA and Ambition serve as a call to action for the Company’s employees, challenging them to grow, transform, lead, and win. The
Company captures our ambition with our employees as follows:

We believe

growth and scale benefits drive value creation

and we
achieve our potential by putting the

consumer first in everything that we do

. Our portfolio is

a powerful collection of leading brands

in large, growing, unconsolidated global categories. Over time we are choice-fully building a more
international business that

reaches the consumer wherever they want to buy our brands

. Our strategy is designed

to achieve meaningful relative market share advantage

in our core categories. We will win by combining

Brand
Development

(insights, product design, innovation, brand communication) with

Every Day Great Execution

, partnering with our customers to build our categories and maximize reach, availability, and visibility. We are a

transformative
company

in the stretching ambitions we pursue. The clarity of our strategy and the

decisive way that we put our choices into action

is a distinctive characteristic of our leaders. Money flows to

growth

and we are true to our
entrepreneurial roots by focusing on

impact in the market place

. This process creates growth missions for our

empowered teams

. We build our people as we build new business. We expect our people and our ideas to be judged as

leaders
in our business community

. Our brands are better together. We win by acting as

one operating company

that has the scale and capabilities to

outgrow, out execute, and out spend our competition

. Our strong financial foundation of
cash generation creates a platform for scaling this model through

strategic M&A

in our core categories.



Organizational Structure

Newell Brands makes life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day, where they live, learn, work, and play. The Company achieves this impact
through its leading portfolio of brands, its commitment to further strengthen those brands, and by deploying its brands to new markets around the world. In order to align reporting with the Company’s Growth Game Plan strategy and organization
structure, effective January 1, 2017, Newell Brands is reporting its financial results in five segments as Live, Learn, Work, Play and Other. All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current reporting structure. For financial

offering in multiple categories permits it to more effectively meet the needs of its customers. With families of leading brand names and profitable and innovative new products, the Company can assist volume purchasers in selling a more profitable

Foreign Operations

Information regarding the
Company’s 2017, 2016 and 2015 foreign operations and financial information by geographic area is included in Footnote 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein. Information regarding risks
relating to the Company’s foreign operations is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, of this report and is incorporated by reference herein.

Please
refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company’s Venezuelan operations.



Raw Materials and Sourced Finished Goods

The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements. The raw materials and various purchased
components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. The Company’s product offerings require the purchase of resin, corrugate, glass, plastic, expanded polystyrene, extinguisher powder, nylon, paper,
plastic resin, sawdust, tin plate, wax and wood, natural rubber, electrical components, glass fiber, magnesium, adhesives, various paper-related packaging materials and metals, including steel, stainless steel, aluminum copper and gold. The
Company’s resin purchases principally comprise polyethylene, polypropylene and copolyester.

The Company also relies on third-party manufacturers as
a source for finished goods. Historically, the Company has experienced inflation in sourced product costs due to currency fluctuations and increased input and labor costs. For a limited number of product lines, a single manufacturer or a
limited number of manufacturers may supply substantially all of the finished goods for a product line. In particular, certain businesses within the Company’s Live segment rely on third-party manufacturers for substantially all of their
products. Specifically, the Baby division has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products.

See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion.

Backlog

The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is
not material.

Seasonal Variations

Sales of the
Company’s products tend to be seasonal, with sales, operating income and operating cash flow in the first quarter generally lower than any other quarter during the year, driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the
first quarter. The seasonality of the Company’s sales volume combined with the accounting for fixed costs, such as depreciation, amortization, rent, personnel costs and interest expense, impacts the Company’s results on a quarterly basis.
In addition, the Company tends to generate the majority of its operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results, the timing of annual performance-based compensation payments, customer
program payments, working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company has many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are, in the aggregate, important to its business. The Company’s most

Customers/Competition

The Company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, office superstores, craft stores,

direct-to-consumer

channels, specialty retailers and wholesalers, commercial distributors,

e-commerce

companies and Yankee Candle
retail stores. Additionally, we distribute our Jostens and Waddington products through the academic and achievement channel and foodservice channel, respectively. The dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers, together
with consumer shopping patterns, contributes to a market environment in which dominant multi-category retailers and

e-commerce

companies have strong negotiating power with suppliers. This environment may limit
the Company’s ability to recover cost increases through selling prices.

Current trends among retailers and

e-commerce

companies include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements and requiring suppliers to
maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times. Other trends, in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong

end-user

brands, are for retailers and

e-commerce

companies to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products, under their own private label brands, which compete with the Company’s products. The combination of
these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the Company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big,
consumer-meaningful brands, the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products, continuing improvements in category management and customer service, and the maintenance of strong relationships with large, high-volume
purchasers. The Company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, many of which are large and well-established. Our Yankee Candle retail stores compete primarily with specialty candle and personal care retailers and
a variety of other retailers, including department stores, gift stores and national specialty retailers that carry candles.



The Company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining leading
brands and differentiated products that deliver superior value and performance; delivering superior customer service and consistent

on-time

delivery; producing and procuring products at a competitive cost; and
experienced management. In addition, the Company focuses on building consumer loyalty and increased consumer demand through increased investment in consumer insights and using those insights to develop innovative products and product features that
meet consumers’ needs.

The Company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing
strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company markets its strong multi-product offering through virtually every category of high-volume retailers, including discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs;
department, hardware and specialty stores; home centers; office superstores; contract stationers; and

e-commerce

companies. The Company’s largest customer, Walmart (which includes Sam’s Club),
accounted for approximately 13.7%, 13.5% and 10.9% of net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, across substantially all segments. The Company’s

top-ten

customers in 2017 included (

in
alphabetical order

): amazon, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Costco, Lowe’s, Office Depot, Staples, Target, The Home Depot, Toys ‘R’ Us and Walmart.

Environmental Matters

Information regarding the
Company’s environmental matters is included in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this Annual Report on Form

10-K

and in Footnote 19
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein.

Research and Development

The Company’s research and development efforts focus on developing new, differentiated and innovative products to meet consumers’ needs. The
Company’s product development efforts begin with consumer insights. The Company has consolidated its consumer marketing and insight capabilities into a global center of excellence and is investing further to strengthen these capabilities. The
Company continues to invest to strengthen its product design, research and development capabilities and has consolidated its design and innovation capabilities into a global center of excellence. The Company’s enhanced marketing and insight and
research and development capabilities have been leveraged to implement a new ideation process throughout the business, resulting in idea fragments that feed the development of product concepts.

Information regarding the Company’s research and development costs for each of the past three years is included in Footnote 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference herein.

Employees

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 49,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 12,000 of the Company’s employees are covered by
collective bargaining agreements or are located in countries that have collective arrangements decreed by statute. Management believes that our relationships with our employees and collective bargaining unions are satisfactory.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

The
ownership of the Company’s common stock involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form

10-K

before deciding whether to invest in the Company’s securities. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The
risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks that are currently unknown to the Company or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial may also impair its business or adversely affect its financial
condition or results of operations.

sectors of the economy in various parts of the world.

The Company’s business depends on the strength of the retail, commercial and industrial
sectors of the economy in various parts of the world, primarily in North America, and to a lesser extent Europe, Latin America and Asia. These sectors of the economy are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the
retail industry, which, in turn, are affected by general economic conditions. With continuing challenging global economic conditions, particularly outside of the U.S., there has been considerable pressure on consumer demand, and the resulting impact
on consumer spending has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on demand for the Company’s products, as well as its financial condition and results of operations. The Company could also be negatively impacted by economic crises in
specific countries or regions. Such events could negatively impact the Company’s overall liquidity and/or create significant credit risks relative to its local customers and depository institutions. Consumer demand and the condition of these
sectors of the economy may also be impacted by other external factors such as war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions. The impact of these external factors is difficult to
predict, and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the Company’s business.



The Company is subject to intense competition in a marketplace dominated by large retailers and

e-commerce

companies.

The Company competes with numerous other manufacturers and distributors of consumer and
commercial products, many of which are large and well-established. The Company’s principal customers are large retailers such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, office superstores, commercial distributors and

e-commerce

companies. The dominant share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, has contributed to the formation of dominant multi-category
retailers and

e-commerce

companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Current trends among retailers and

e-commerce

companies include fostering high
levels of competition among suppliers, demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices in response to competitive, economic or other factors, and
requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. Other trends are for retailers and

e-commerce

companies to import products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own
private label brands, typically at lower prices, that compete with the Company’s products.

The combination of these market influences and retailer
consolidation has created an intensely competitive environment in which the Company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big, consumer-meaningful
brands, the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products, continuing improvements in category management and customer service, and the maintenance of strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company also
faces the risk of changes in the strategy or structure of its major customers, such as overall store and inventory reductions. The intense competition in the retail and

e-commerce

sectors, combined with the
overall economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. For example, the Company’s results in 2017 were impacted negatively by the reorganization filing of a major customer
in the Baby division within the Live segment. In particular, a loss of, or a failure by, one of the Company’s large customers could adversely impact the Company’s sales and operating cash flows. To address these challenges, the Company
must be able to respond to competitive factors, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases.

The Company’s sales are dependent on purchases from several large customers and any significant decline in these purchases or pressure from these
customers to reduce prices could have a negative effect on the Company’s future financial performance.

The Company’s customer base is
relatively fragmented. Although the Company has long-established relationships with many customers, the Company generally does not have any long-term supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases with its largest customers.
Purchases by these customers are generally made using individual purchase orders. As a result, these customers may cancel their orders, change purchase quantities from forecast volumes, delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond the
Company’s control or change other terms of the business relationship. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in purchases or changes in business practices or by customers could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, because many of the Company’s costs are fixed, a reduction in customer demand could have an adverse effect on the Company’s gross profit margins and
operating income.

The Company depends on a continuous flow of new orders from large, high-volume retail customers; however, the Company may be unable to
continually meet the needs of these customers. Retailers are increasing their demands on suppliers to:

•

reduce lead times for product delivery, which may require the Company to increase inventories and could impact the timing of reported sales;

•

improve customer service, such as with direct import programs, whereby product is supplied directly to retailers from third-party suppliers; and

•

adopt technologies related to inventory management such as Radio Frequency Identification, otherwise known as RFID technology, which may have substantial implementation costs.

The Company cannot provide any assurance that it can continue to successfully meet the needs of its customers. A substantial decrease in sales to any of its
major customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company’s
customers may further consolidate, which could materially adversely affect its sales and margins.

The Company’s customers have steadily
consolidated over the last two decades. The Company expects any customers that consolidate will take actions to harmonize pricing from their suppliers, close retail outlets and rationalize their supply chain, which could adversely affect the
Company’s business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that, following consolidation, the Company’s large customers will continue to buy from the Company across different product categories or geographic regions, or at



the same levels as prior to consolidation, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial results. Further, if the consolidation trend continues, it could result in future pricing and
other competitive pressures that could reduce the Company’s sales and margins and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company’s plans to continue to improve productivity and reduce complexity and costs may not be successful, which would materially adversely affect
its ability to compete.

The Company’s success depends on its ability to continuously improve its manufacturing operations to gain efficiencies,
reduce supply chain costs and streamline or redeploy nonstrategic selling, general and administrative expenses in order to produce products at a best-cost position and allow the Company to invest in innovation and brand building, including
advertising and promotion. The Company is currently in the process of delivering the cost synergies related to the acquisition of Jarden. Both efforts are global initiatives designed to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase
investment in the Company’s most significant growth platforms. Project Renewal and the Company’s cost saving plans associated with the Jarden integration may not be completed substantially as planned, may be more costly to implement than
expected, or may not result in, in full or in part, the positive effects anticipated. In addition, such initiatives require the Company to implement a significant amount of organizational change, which could have a negative impact on employee
engagement, divert management’s attention from other concerns, and if not properly managed, impact the Company’s ability to retain key employees, cause disruptions in the Company’s

day-to-day

operations and have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. It is also possible that other major productivity and streamlining programs may be required in the future.

If the Company is unable to commercialize a continuing stream of new products that create demand, the Company’s ability to compete in the marketplace
may be adversely impacted.

The Company’s strategy includes investment in new product development and a focus on innovation. Its long-term success
in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products and line extensions that create demand. New product development and
commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the Company has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization,
product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income. The Company also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce
innovative new products that compete with the Company’s products. In addition, sales generated by new products or line extensions could cause a decline in sales of the Company’s existing products. If new product development and
commercialization efforts are not successful, the Company’s financial results could be adversely affected.

If the Company does not continue to
develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.

The Company’s ability to compete successfully also depends increasingly on its ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that the Company’s
retailer and other customers will need the Company’s products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow the Company to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant
investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While the Company plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not
deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment.

The Company incurred
substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the Jarden Acquisition which could materially adversely affect the Company and its financial position, including decreasing its business flexibility and increasing its borrowing costs.

The Company incurred an additional $6.5 billion of debt (excluding approximately $4.1 billion of Jarden debt refinanced in connection with the
acquisition) in connection with the completion of the Jarden Acquisition. Following completion of the Jarden Acquisition, the Company substantially increased its debt compared to its recent historical levels. This increased level of debt will
increase the Company’s interest expense and could have the effect, among other things, of reducing the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, if the Company is unable to timely reduce
its level of indebtedness, the Company will be subject to increased demands on its cash resources, which could increase its total

debt-to-capitalization

ratios, decrease
its interest coverage ratios, result in a breach of covenants or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the Company.

An
increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

While the vast majority of the Company’s debt is
fixed, fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs on the portion that is variable and interest rate increases on this portion of the company’s debt could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. In
response to the last global economic recession, extraordinary monetary policy actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and



other central banking institutions, including the utilization of quantitative easing, were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. However, in both December 2015 and
December 2016, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate, each time by a quarter of a percentage point. In 2017, the U.S. Federal Reserve again raised its benchmark interest rate in March, June and December, each time by a quarter
of a percentage point. While it is unclear whether such action over the last three years suggests a change in previous monetary policy positions, any such change or market expectation of such change may result in significantly higher long-term
interest rates. Such a transition may be abrupt and may, among other things, reduce the availability and/or increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness.

If the Company is unable to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate its acquired businesses, the Company’s future growth and profitability could
be adversely impacted.

The Company’s ability to continue to make strategic acquisitions and to integrate the acquired businesses successfully
remain important factors in the Company’s future growth. In 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of Sistema Plastics, a New Zealand-based provider of food storage containers primarily under the Sistema

®

brand, Smith Mountain Industries, a provider of home fragrance products, primarily under the WoodWick

®

Candle and Chesapeake Bay Candle

®

brands, a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of premium candles and other home fragrance products, focused on consumer wellness and natural fragrance. In April 2016, the Company
completed the acquisition of Jarden Corporation, which had recently acquired Jostens, Inc. and Waddington Group Inc. The Company’s ability to successfully integrate these or any other acquired business is dependent upon its ability to identify
suitable acquisition candidates, integrate and manage product lines that have been acquired, obtain anticipated cost savings and operating income improvements within a reasonable period of time, assume unknown liabilities, known contingent
liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, and manage unanticipated demands on the Company’s management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Furthermore, the
Company’s ability to finance major acquisitions may be adversely affected by the Company’s financial position and access to credit markets. In addition, significant additional borrowings would increase the Company’s borrowing costs
and could adversely affect its credit rating and could constrain the Company’s future access to capital. The Company may not successfully manage these or other risks it may encounter in acquiring and integrating a business or product line,
which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

Circumstances associated with divestitures and product line exits could adversely affect
the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The Company continually evaluates the performance and strategic fit of its
businesses and products. In June 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Décor business, which comprised its Levolor

®

and
Kirsch

®

window coverings brands. In March 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Tools business which comprised the Irwin

®

Lenox

®

and hilmor

®

brands. In July 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Winter Sports business, which included the Völkl

®

and K2

®

brands. In the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed the sale of the remaining portions of its Rubbermaid

®

consumer storage totes business. The Company may decide to sell or discontinue other businesses or products in the future based on an evaluation of performance and strategic fit. On
January 25, 2018, the Company announced that it will explore a series of strategic initiatives to accelerate its transformation plan, improve operational performance and enhance shareholder value. The components of that plan include exploring
the sale of a number of the industrial, commercial and small consumer businesses such as Waddington; Process Solutions; Rubbermaid Commercial Products; Mapa; Rawlings; Goody; Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage; and US Playing Cards. A
decision to divest or discontinue a business or product may result in asset impairments, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, and losses upon disposition, both of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s
results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies at acceptable prices and terms and in a timely manner and prospective buyers may have
difficulty obtaining financing. Divestitures and business discontinuations could involve additional risks, including the following:

•

difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel;

•

the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;

•

the retention of certain current or future liabilities in order to induce a buyer to complete a divestiture;

•

the disruption of the Company’s business; and

•

the potential loss of key employees.

The Company may not be successful in managing these or any other
significant risks that it may encounter in divesting or discontinuing a business or exiting product lines, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.

The Company’s operating results can be adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy, transportation and other
necessary supplies and services.



Pricing and availability of raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services for
use in the Company’s businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond its control, including general, domestic and international economic conditions, natural disasters, labor costs, production levels, competition, consumer demand,
import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. For example, in 2017 the Company’s results were negatively impacted by raw material and transportation cost inflation and shortages resulting from hurricanes in the United States. This
volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials, energy, transportation and other supplies and services for the Company, and may, therefore, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of
operations and financial condition.

The Company’s success is dependent, in part, on its continued ability to reduce its exposure to increases in
those costs through a variety of programs, including periodic purchases, future delivery purchases, long-term contracts, sales price adjustments and certain derivative instruments, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Also, the
Company relies on third-party manufacturers as a source for its products. These manufacturers are also subject to price volatility and labor cost and other inflationary pressures, which may, in turn, result in an increase in the amount the Company
pays for sourced products. During periods of rising prices of raw materials, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers. Conversely, when raw material prices decline, customer
demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and, to the extent the Company has existing inventory, lower margins. As a result, fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Some of the products the Company manufactures require particular types of glass, metal, paper, plastic,
resin, wax, wood or other materials. Supply shortages for a particular type of material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of manufacturing the Company’s products. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company’s operations are dependent upon third-party vendors and suppliers whose
failure to perform adequately could disrupt the Company’s business operations.

The Company currently sources a significant portion of parts and
products from third parties. The Company’s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact the Company’s success in meeting customer demand for timely
delivery of quality products. In many cases, the Company does not enter into long-term contracts with its primary vendors and suppliers, instead buying parts and products on a “purchase order” basis. As a result, the Company may be subject
to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products.

The ability of third-party suppliers to timely deliver finished goods and/or raw materials, and
the ability of the Company’s own facilities to timely deliver finished goods, may be affected by events beyond their control, such as inability of shippers to timely deliver merchandise due to work stoppages or slowdowns, or significant weather
and health conditions affecting manufacturers and/or shippers. Any adverse change in the Company’s relationships with its third-party suppliers, the financial condition of third-party suppliers, the ability of third-party suppliers to
manufacture and deliver outsourced parts or products on a timely basis, or the Company’s ability to import products from third-party suppliers or its own facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of
operations and financial condition.

In addition, the financial condition of the Company’s vendors and suppliers may be adversely affected by general
economic conditions, such as credit difficulties and the uncertain macroeconomic environment in recent years. In addition, in some instances the Company maintains single-source or limited-source sourcing relationships, either because multiple
sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity or price considerations. For example, certain businesses in the Baby division have a single source of supply for products that
comprise a majority of their sales and which owns intellectual property rights in respect of many of those products. Should any of these single source suppliers fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a
particular component, the Company may not be able to find alternative vendors and suppliers in a timely manner, if at all. Any inability of the Company’s vendors and suppliers to timely deliver quality parts and products or any unanticipated
change in supply, quality or pricing of products could be disruptive and costly to the Company.

The Company cannot assure you that it could quickly or
effectively replace any of its suppliers if the need arose, and the Company cannot assure you that it could retrieve tooling and molds possessed by any of its third-party suppliers. The Company’s dependence on these few suppliers could also
adversely affect its ability to react quickly and effectively to changes in the market for its products.

Changes in foreign, cultural, political and
financial market conditions could impair the Company’s international operations and financial performance.

Some of the Company’s operations
are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed, such as Brazil; or where economies have suffered economic, social and/or political instability or hyperinflation; or where the ability to repatriate funds has been
significantly delayed or impaired. Current government economic and fiscal policies in these economies, including stimulus measures and currency exchange rates and controls, may not be sustainable and, as a result, the Company’s sales or



profits related to those countries may decline. The economies of other foreign countries important to the Company’s operations could also suffer slower economic growth or economic, social
and/or political instability or hyperinflation in the future. The Company’s international operations (and particularly its business in emerging markets), including manufacturing and sourcing operations (and the international operations of the
Company’s customers), are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect the Company, including, among other things:

•

protectionist policies restricting or impairing the manufacturing, sales or import and export of the Company’s products;

•

new restrictions on access to markets;

•

lack of developed infrastructure;

•

inflation (including hyperinflation) or recession;

•

devaluations or fluctuations in the value of currencies;

•

changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, tax laws, accounting standards, trade protection measures and import and export
licensing requirements, environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws;

•

social, political or economic instability;

•

acts of war and terrorism;

•

natural disasters or other crises;

•

reduced protection of intellectual property rights;

•

increases in duties and taxation;

•

restrictions on transfer of funds and/or exchange of currencies;

•

expropriation of assets or forced relocations of operations; and

•

other adverse changes in policies, including monetary, tax and/or lending policies, encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by host countries.

Should any of these risks occur, the Company’s ability to manufacture, source, sell or export its products or repatriate profits could be impaired; the
Company could experience a loss of sales and profitability from its international operations; and/or the Company could experience a substantial impairment or loss of assets, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
business.

The Company has foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect the Company’s operating
results, financial condition and liquidity.

The financial position and results of operations of many of the Company’s international subsidiaries
are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the Company’s financial statements. The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against these foreign
currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on the Company’s reported sales, operating margin and operating income (and conversely, the weakening of the U.S. Dollar has a positive impact). For the year ended December 31, 2017, foreign
currency favorably affected reported sales by $34 million compared to prior year; however, the volatility of foreign exchange rates is unpredictable and could materially adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company realizes margin impacts from changes in foreign currency because the Company’s costs for produced and sourced products are largely
denominated in U.S. Dollars, and the Company’s international operations generally sell the Company’s products at prices denominated in local currencies. When local currencies decline in value relative to the U.S. Dollar in the regions
in which the Company sells products whose costs are denominated in U.S. Dollars, the Company’s international businesses would need to increase the local currency sales prices of the products and/or reduce costs through productivity or other
initiatives in order to maintain the same level of profitability. The Company may not be able to increase the selling prices of its products in its international businesses due to market dynamics, competition or otherwise and may not realize cost
reductions through productivity or other initiatives. As a result, gross margins and overall operating results of the Company’s international businesses would be adversely affected when the U.S. Dollar strengthens.

The Company has been adversely impacted by developments in Venezuela, including the significant devaluations of the Venezuelan Bolivar that have occurred in
recent years, the declining availability of U.S. Dollars and the implementation of pricing and exchange controls in Venezuela. As of December 31, 2015, the Company determined that it no longer could exercise control over the operations of its
Venezuela subsidiary. Accordingly, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuela subsidiary on December 31, 2015 and recorded a pretax charge of $173 million.



Future government actions, including but not limited to, currency devaluations, import authorization controls,
foreign exchange controls, price or profit controls or expropriation or other forms of government take-over, could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information.

A failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service
providers could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business or reputation.

The Company relies extensively on information technology
(IT) systems, networks and services, including Internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third
parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to:

•

ordering and managing materials from suppliers;

•

converting materials to finished products;

•

shipping products to customers;

•

marketing and selling products to consumers;

•

collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data;

•

processing transactions;

•

summarizing and reporting results of operations;

•

hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information;

•

complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements;

•

providing data security; and

•

handling other processes necessary to manage the Company’s business.

Increased IT security threats and
more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the Company’s IT systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company’s
data. The Company’s operations, especially its retail operations, involve the storage and transmission of employees’, customers’ and consumers’ proprietary information, such as credit card and bank account numbers. The
Company’s payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes, including unauthorized use of credit cards, debit cards or bank account information, identity theft or merchant fraud. If the IT systems, networks or
service providers relied upon fail to function properly, or if the Company suffers a loss or disclosure of customers’ and consumers’ data, business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events
to power outages to security breaches, and business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations, a risk of government enforcement action,
litigation and possible liability, and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations and/or financial condition.

As techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target,
the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of the Company’s security occurs, the public perception of the effectiveness of the Company’s security
measures could be harmed and the Company could lose customers and consumers, which could adversely affect its business.

Impairment charges could have
a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.

Future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of the
Company’s assets and require impairment charges. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the
Company’s sales and customer base, the unfavorable resolution of litigation, a material adverse change in the Company’s relationship with significant customers or business partners, or a sustained decline in the Company’s stock price.
The Company continues to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on the Company and its business units to assess whether impairment indicators are present. Accordingly, the Company may be required to perform impairment tests based on
changes in the economic environment and other factors, and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future.

The Company’s businesses
and operations are subject to regulation in the U.S. and abroad.



Changes in laws, regulations and related interpretations may alter the environment in which the Company does
business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards, taxation and other regulations. Accordingly, the Company’s ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters
(including environmental, human resource, product liability, patent and intellectual property matters), and to resolve pending legal and environmental matters without significant liability could require the Company to record significant reserves in
excess of amounts accrued to date or pay significant fines during a reporting period, which could materially impact the Company’s results. In addition, new regulations may be enacted in the U.S. or abroad that may require the Company to incur
additional personnel-related, environmental or other costs on an ongoing basis, significantly restrict the Company’s ability to sell certain products, or incur fines or penalties for noncompliance, any of which could adversely affect the
Company’s results of operations.

As a U.S.-based multinational company, the Company is also subject to tax regulations in the U.S. and multiple
foreign jurisdictions, some of which are interdependent. If these or other tax regulations should change, the Company’s financial results could be materially impacted. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.

The Company may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations.

In addition to operational standards, environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost
of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. Accordingly, the Company may be liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently
owned or operated by the Company, is a landfill or other location where it has disposed wastes, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to the Company’s ownership or operation of the property. Given the nature of the
past industrial operations conducted by the Company and others at these properties, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified, even for those properties where an environmental
site assessment has been conducted. The Company does not believe that any of the Company’s existing remediation obligations, including at third-party sites where it has been named a potentially responsible party, will have a material adverse
effect upon its business, results of operations or financial condition. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination, may give rise to additional
remediation liabilities that may be material. See “Environmental Matters” under Footnote 19 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form

10-K

for
the year ended December 31, 2017 for a further discussion of these and other environmental-related matters.

The Company may not be able to
attract, retain and develop key personnel.

The Company’s success at implementing Project Renewal, the Growth Game Plan, the integration of Jarden
and its future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s success also depends, in part, on its continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified personnel. Competition for
such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company can retain its key employees or attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.

The resolution of the Company’s tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities, which could adversely impact the Company’s cash flows
and results of operations.

The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Significant estimation and
judgment are required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The
Company is regularly under audit by various worldwide tax authorities. Although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its
historical income tax provisions and accruals. There can be no assurance that the resolution of any audits or litigation will not have an adverse effect on future operating results.

The Company’s business involves the potential for product recalls, product liability and other claims against it, which could affect its earnings and
financial condition.



As a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, the Company is subject to the Consumer Products Safety
Act of 1972, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous, and similar laws under foreign jurisdictions. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety
Commission or a comparable foreign agency could require the Company to repurchase or recall one or more of its products. Additionally, other laws and agencies, such as the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, regulate certain
consumer products sold by the Company in the United States and abroad, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. Any repurchase or recall of the Company’s products could be costly and damaging to the Company’s
reputation. If the Company were required to remove, or it voluntarily removed, its products from the market, the Company’s reputation could be tarnished and the Company might have large quantities of finished products that it could not sell.
The Company also faces exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of its products is alleged to have resulted in property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments or
fines or penalties that may result from any governmental investigations, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company’s reputation in the marketplace, adversely impact the value
of its

end-user

brands, or result in an increase in the cost of producing the Company’s products.

Although
the Company maintains product liability insurance in amounts that it believes are reasonable, that insurance is, in most cases, subject to large self-insured retentions for which the Company is responsible, and the Company cannot assure you that it
will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future or that product liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage. Additionally, the Company does not maintain product recall insurance. As a
result, product recalls or product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company faces potential other types of litigation arising out of
alleged defects in its products or otherwise, such as class action lawsuits. The Company does not maintain insurance against many types of claims involving alleged defects in its products that do not involve personal injury or property damage. The
Company spends substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards. However, compliance with these standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost
and risk. As a result, these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company’s product liability insurance program is an occurrence-based program based on its current and historical claims experience and the
availability and cost of insurance. The Company currently either self-insures or administers a high retention insurance program for most product liability risks. Historically, product liability awards have rarely exceeded the Company’s
individual per occurrence self-insured retention. The Company cannot assure you, however, that its future product liability experience will be consistent with its past experience or that claims and awards subject to self-insured retention will not
be material.

See Footnote 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form

10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a further discussion of these and other regulatory and litigation-related matters.

If the Company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products, which could adversely
affect the Company’s market share and results of operations.

The Company’s success with its proprietary products depends, in part, on its
ability to protect its current and future technologies and products and to defend its intellectual property rights, including its patent and trademark rights. If the Company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, competitors
may manufacture and market similar products.

The Company holds numerous design and utility patents covering a wide variety of products. The Company
cannot be sure that it will receive patents for any of its patent applications or that any existing or future patents that it receives or licenses will provide competitive advantages for its products. The Company also cannot be sure that competitors
will not challenge, invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents that the Company receives or licenses. In addition, patent rights may not prevent competitors from developing, using or selling products that are similar or
functionally equivalent to the Company’s products.

A reduction in the Company’s credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its
business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company’s credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and,
accordingly, the Company’s cost of capital. The Company’s credit ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of its financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations. The Company cannot be sure
that any of its current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A downgrade by Moody’s Investor Services,
Inc. (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“Standard & Poor’s”), which would reduce the Company’s senior debt below investment-grade, would increase the Company’s borrowing
costs, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial results. Specifically, the interest rate payable on Notes issued in March 2016 are subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s
downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the Notes, though the interest on these notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in ratings by either credit Rating Agency), if
such Notes become rated “Baa1” or higher by Moody’s and “BBB+” or higher by Standard & Poors, in each case with stable or positive outlook. In addition, in the event of a reduction in credit rating, the Company
would likely be



required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease. If the Company’s short-term ratings were to be lowered,
it would limit, or eliminate entirely, the Company’s access to the commercial paper market. The ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Company’s securities, and each rating should be evaluated
independently of any other rating.

The level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation
purposes could affect the Company’s earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in government regulations could also affect the Company’s pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements.

The funding obligations for the Company’s pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets, and
interest rates. Funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are
expected under the governmental funding calculations, the Company could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be very volatile, and therefore the Company’s estimate of future contribution requirements can change
dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the
plans could significantly increase the Company’s required contributions in the future and adversely impact its liquidity.

Assumptions used in
determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans are determined by the Company in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that the Company
determines that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, expected health care costs, or mortality rates, the Company’s future pension and postretirement benefit
expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the assumptions that the Company uses may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on the Company’s
pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.

Damage to the Company’s reputation could have an adverse
effect on the Company’s business

.

Maintaining the Company’s strong reputation with consumers and suppliers worldwide is critical to the
Company’s continued success. Adverse publicity about the Company, its brands, corporate practices, or any other issue that may be associated with the Company, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize that reputation. Such adverse publicity
could come from traditional sources such as government investigations or public or private litigation, but may also arise from negative comments on social media regarding the Company or its brands. Damage to the Company’s reputation or a loss
of consumer confidence in the Company’s brands could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to repair the harm.

Governmental investigations or actions by other third parties could have a material adverse effect on management and the Company’s business
operations.

The Company is subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. Responding to governmental investigations or actions by
regulatory bodies may be both time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations and could divert the attention of management and key personnel from the Company’s business operations. The impact of these and other investigations and
lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

A deterioration in labor relations
could adversely impact the Company’s global business.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 49,000 employees, 12,000 of
whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are located in countries that have collective arrangements decreed by statute. The Company periodically negotiates with certain unions representing Company employees and may be subject to work
stoppages or may be unable to renew such collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms, or at all, all of which may have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company.

A potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could result in potential operational disruption, divert our resources and
could potentially result in adverse consequences under certain of our debt documents and other agreements.

On February 8, 2018, Starboard Value and
Opportunity Master Fund Ltd. (“Starboard”) delivered a letter to us nominating 10 director candidates for election to the Board at our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders (the “2018 Annual Meeting”). If Starboard is successful,
it is possible that Starboard-nominated directors could constitute a majority of the Board following the 2018 Annual Meeting.



A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and could result
in potential operational disruption. Further, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel
and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.

If Starboard is able to replace a majority of our existing
Board members, such a substantial Board turnover may constitute a change of control for purposes of our indentures and notes issued thereunder. In such event, absent amendment, consent or other action, certain outstanding series of our debt may
require that we make a change of control offer at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest if the change of control is accompanied by a rating event, which generally would require, among other things, a downgrade of our debt rating
below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies within specified time periods. In addition, a change of control under these notes could, absent amendment, consent or other action, trigger a termination event under our securitization
facility. In the event Starboard proceeds with its threatened election contest, the Company and its Board will evaluate what amendments, consents, determinations or technical actions could or should be made to address the potential adverse
consequences to the Company from a potential change of control with respect to any outstanding indebtedness.

Further, a change in a majority of the Board
may, under certain circumstances, result in a change of control under employment security agreements we have with our executive management, as well as our 2013 Incentive Plan and equity based awards issued thereunder. Pursuant to the agreements and
awards, certain payments and vesting provisions may be triggered following a change of control, either immediately or conditioned upon a qualifying termination that occurs within 24 months of any such change of control.

The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Under the Company’s Stock Repurchase Program (the “SRP”), the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock through

10b5-1

automatic trading plans,
discretionary market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or a combination thereof. In September 2017, the Company announced that it is reinstating its SRP that the Company voluntarily suspended in the fourth quarter of 2015, in association
with the Jarden Acquisition. On November 2, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an extension and expansion to the Company’s existing SRP. Under the updated SRP, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to
approximately $1.26 billion of its outstanding shares through the end of 2020. The updated SPR amount of approximately $1.26 billion consists of the $256 million remaining under the previous SPR which was scheduled to expire at the end of 2017
and the new authorization of $1.0 billion approved by the Board of Directors.

Business Strategy

During 2017, the Company continued to execute the Growth Game Plan, the multi-year strategy that was updated in late 2016 for the new broader portfolio. The
Growth Game Plan enables the simplification of the organization and frees up resources to invest in growth initiatives and strengthened capabilities in support of the Company’s brands. The changes being implemented in the execution of the
Growth Game Plan are considered key enablers to building a more profitable and cash flow generative company, with global reach.

As part of the Growth
Game Plan, the Company has transformed from a holding company to an operating company, consolidating its 32 business units into 16 global divisions while investing to extend its design, innovation, brand development and

E-commerce

capabilities across a broader set of categories. The new global divisions are the key commercial nodes in the Company, including a Global

E-commerce

Division with
responsibility for all

E-commerce

activity across the enterprise. The divisions generally align to the four areas of strategic focus for the Company of Live, Learn, Work, and Play. The new structure became
effective January 1, 2017.

In 2017, the Company focused and strengthened its portfolio by completing seven divestitures and three

bolt-on

acquisitions in the Food Storage and Home Fragrance categories. In the second half of 2017 and throughout 2018, the Company has focused and will focus on strengthening the organization, cash generation and
delivering on the cost saving agenda.

In January 2018, Newell Brands announced that it will explore a series of strategic initiatives to accelerate its
transformation plan, improve operational performance and enhance shareholder value. The Company is exploring strategic options for industrial and commercial product assets, including Waddington, Process Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products and
Mapa, as well as the smaller consumer businesses, including Rawlings, Goody, Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage, and U.S. Playing Cards. Execution of these strategic options would significantly reduce operational complexity and focus the
Company’s remaining portfolio on leading brands in global consumer-facing categories that can leverage Newell Brands’ advantaged capabilities in brands, innovation, design and

E-commerce.

Organizational Structure

Newell Brands makes life
better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day, where they live, learn, work, and play. The Company achieves this impact through its leading portfolio of brands, its commitment to further strengthen those brands, and by deploying these to
new markets around the world. In order to align reporting with the Company’s Growth Game Plan strategy and organization structure, effective January 1, 2017, Newell Brands is reporting its financial results in five segments as Live, Learn,
Work, Play and Other. All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current reporting structure.

Acquisitions

2017 Activity

In September 2017, the Company
acquired Chesapeake Bay Candle, a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of premium candles and other home fragrance products, focused on consumer wellness and natural fragrance, for a cash purchase price of approximately $75 million.
Chesapeake Bay Candle is included in the Live segment from the date of acquisition.

In April 2017, the Company acquired Sistema Plastics, a leading New
Zealand based manufacturer and marketer of innovative food storage containers with strong market shares and presence in Australia, New Zealand, U.K. and parts of continental Europe for a cash purchase price of approximately $472 million.
Sistema is included in the Live segment from the date of acquisition.

In January 2017, the Company acquired Smith Mountain Industries (“Smith
Mountain”), a leading provider of premium home fragrance products, sold primarily under the WoodWick

®

Candle brand, for a cash purchase price of approximately $100 million. Smith
Mountain is included in the Live segment from the date of acquisition.

2016 Activity

On April 15, 2016, the Company acquired Jarden for total consideration of $18.7 billion including cash paid, shares issued and debt assumed, net of
cash acquired (“the Jarden Acquisition”). The total consideration paid or payable for shares of Jarden common stock was approximately $15.3 billion, including $5.4 billion of cash and $9.9 billion of the Company’s
common stock. The Jarden Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, Jarden’s results of operations are included in the Company’s results of operations since the acquisition date. Jarden was a
leading, global consumer products company with leading brands such as

Crock-Pot

®

, FoodSaver

®

,
Mr. Coffee

®

, Oster

®

, Coleman

®

, First Alert

®

, Rawlings

®

, Jostens

®

,
Marmot

®

, Yankee Candle

®

and many others. See Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The transformative transaction created a global consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading brands in large, growing, unconsolidated, global markets.
The scaled enterprise is expected to accelerate profitable growth with leading brands in a global market that exceeds $100 billion, with business and capability development supported by the efficiencies of the combined company. Management
believes the scale of Newell Brands in key categories, channels and geographies creates a much broader opportunity to deploy the Company’s advantaged set of brand development and commercial capabilities for accelerated growth and margin
expansion.

2015 Activity

In October 2015, the
Company acquired Elmer’s Products, Inc. (“Elmer’s”) for a purchase price of $571 million. Elmer’s, whose brands include Elmer’s

®

, Krazy Glue

®

(a trademark of Toagosei Co. Ltd. used with permission) and

X-Acto

®

, is a provider of
activity-based adhesive and cutting products that inspire creativity in the classroom, at home, in the office, in the workshop and at the craft table. Elmer’s is included in the Learn segment from date of acquisition.

Divestitures

On July 14, 2017, the Company
sold its Winter Sports business for a selling price of approximately $240 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of
$59.1 million related to the writedown of the carrying value of the net assets of the Winter Sports business based on the expected proceeds to be received. The impairment charge is comprised of a $12.6 million charge related to the
impairment of goodwill and a $46.5 million charge related to the impairment of other intangible assets. The Company recorded a

pre-tax

loss on sale of $47.6 million driven by funding the
business’ working capital needs and withholding taxes between June 30, 2017 and July 14, 2017, which is included in other expense (income), net in consolidated statement of operations for 2017.

During 2017, the Company sold its Rubbermaid

®

consumer storage totes business, its stroller business
under the Teutonia

®

brand, its Lehigh business, its firebuilding business and its triathlon apparel business under the Zoot

®

and
Squadra

®

brands. The selling prices for these businesses were not material. Based on the consideration received, the Company recorded impairment charges of $15.3 million related to the
write down of the carrying value of the net assets of the firebuilding and Teutonia

®

stroller businesses to their estimated fair market value. The Company sold the firebuilding business to
Royal Oak Enterprises, LLC (“Royal Oak”). Martin E. Franklin and Ian G.H. Ashken are affiliates of Royal Oak and were Company directors during 2017.

In March 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Tools business, including the Irwin

®

, Lenox

®

and Hilmor

®

brands. The selling price was $1.95 billion, subject to customary working capital adjustments. The net assets of the
Tools business were approximately $1.1 billion, including approximately $711 million of goodwill, resulting in a pretax gain of $768 million, which is included in other (income) expense, net for 2017.



In June 2016, the Company sold its Décor business, including Levolor

®

and Kirsch

®

window coverings and drapery hardware, for consideration, net of fees, of approximately $224 million, resulting in a
pretax gain of $160 million, which is included in other (income) expense, net for 2016.

During 2015, the Company sold Endicia for net proceeds of
$209 million resulting in a pretax gain of $154 million which is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2015. During 2015, the Company ceased operations in its Culinary electrics and retail businesses.

Ongoing Restructuring Initiatives

After the
completion of the Jarden Acquisition, the Company initiated a comprehensive strategic assessment of the business and launched a new corporate strategy that focuses the portfolio, prioritizes investment in the categories with the greatest potential
for growth, and extends the Company’s advantaged capabilities in insights, product design, innovation, and

E-commerce

to the broadened portfolio. The investments in new capabilities are designed to unlock
the growth potential of the portfolio and will be funded by a commitment to release cost savings from 2016 to 2021 of approximately $1.3 billion through the combination of the completion of Project Renewal (approximately $300 million) and
delivery of cost synergies associated with the Jarden integration (approximately $1 billion). This new corporate strategy is called the Growth Game Plan and builds on the successful track record of growth acceleration, margin development, and value
creation associated with the transformation of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. from 2011 through 2016.

Project Renewal

In April 2015, the Company committed to a further expansion of Project Renewal (the “April 2015 Expansion”). Project Renewal was initially launched
in October 2011 to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in growth platforms within the business. Under Project Renewal, the Company has simplified and aligned its businesses around two key activities —
Brand & Category Development and Market Execution & Delivery. Pursuant to an expansion of Project Renewal in October 2014, the Company has: (i) further streamlined its supply chain function, including reducing overhead and
realigning the supply chain management structure; (ii) invested in value analysis and value engineering efforts to reduce product and packaging costs; (iii) reduced operational and manufacturing complexity in its Learn segment; and
(iv) further streamlined its distribution and transportation functions. Under the April 2015 Expansion, the Company has further implemented additional activities designed to further streamline business partnering functions (e.g., Finance/IT,
Legal and Human Resources), optimize global selling and trade marketing functions and rationalize the Company’s real estate portfolio. Project Renewal was completed by the end of 2017, and as a result, additional cash payments and savings will
be realized thereafter.

See Footnote 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Jarden Integration

The Company currently expects
to incur up to $1.0 billion of restructuring and other costs through 2021 to integrate the legacy Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden businesses (the “Jarden Integration”). Initially, integration projects will primarily be focused on driving
cost synergies in procurement, overhead functions and organizational changes designed to redefine the operating model of the Company from a holding company to an operating company. Restructuring costs associated with integration projects are
expected to include employee-related cash costs, including severance, retirement and other termination benefits, and contract termination and other costs. In addition, other costs associated with the Jarden Integration include advisory and personnel
costs for managing and implementing integration projects.

Foreign Currency – Venezuela

Until December 31, 2015, the Company accounted for its Venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting, and therefore, the Company remeasured
assets, liabilities, sales and expenses denominated in Bolivar Fuertes (“Bolivars”) into U.S. Dollars using the applicable exchange rate, and the resulting translation adjustments were included in earnings. As of December 31, 2015,
the Company determined it could no longer exercise control over its Venezuela operations because the availability of U.S. Dollars had declined significantly over the past several years in each of Venezuela’s three exchange mechanisms. As a
result, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan operations.

Prior to the deconsolidation of the Venezuela operations on December 31, 2015, the
results of the Company’s Venezuelan operations have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2015 and all prior periods. As of December 31, 2015, the Company began accounting for its investment in its
Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting, and the cost basis was adjusted to nil as of December 31, 2015.

During 2015 the
Venezuelan operations generated 2.2% of consolidated net sales and $51.1 million of the Company’s reported annual operating income.



As a result of deconsolidating its Venezuelan operations, the Company recorded a charge of $173 million in
2015. The charge consisted of the

write-off

of the Company’s Venezuelan operations’ net assets of $74.7 million, as well as $58.3 million of Venezuela receivable-related assets held by
other subsidiaries, resulting in $133 million of total charges associated with the deconsolidation of Venezuela’s net assets. In addition, in accordance with applicable accounting standards for foreign currency and the transition to the
cost method for Venezuela’s operations, the Company was required to

write-off

the currency translation adjustment that arose prior to the application of hyperinflationary accounting in 2010 that was
included in other comprehensive loss in equity. The

write-off

of the currency translation adjustment resulted in a

pre-tax

charge of $39.7 million.

Impact of Hurricanes and Market Conditions

During
the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey significantly disrupted a large part of the U.S. resin manufacturing supply chain. As a result of the disruption, the Company has experienced increased resin and transportation cost inflation.

NMF – Not meaningful

The
increase in net sales for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition, as well as other acquisitions (approximately 20%), partially offset by divestitures (approximately 8%). Foreign currency impacts on a period-over-period basis were not
material.

The change in cost of products sold for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition, as well as other acquisitions (approximately $1.8
billion), partially offset by inventory

step-up

charges primarily related to the Jarden Acquisition recorded in 2016 (approximately $480 million) and the impact of divestitures (approximately $650 million).
Gross margin was 34.5% versus 33.2% percent in 2016. The change was primarily due to the impact of the inventory

step-up

charge recorded in 2016 and the benefits of synergies and productivity, partially offset
by the negative mix effects partially related to the Jarden Acquisition.

The change in SG&A for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition, as
well as other acquisitions (approximately $720 million) and increased investment related to brand development,

E-commerce

and insights, partially offset by the impact of divestitures (approximately $200
million) and benefits of synergies and productivity. Additionally, the decrease in certain labor-related costs was mostly offset by an increase in integration costs.

The restructuring costs for 2017 were mostly comprised of costs related to the Jarden Integration and other restructuring activities, which primarily relate
to the Jarden Acquisition. The restructuring costs for 2016 related to the Jarden Integration and Project Renewal. See Footnote 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

The impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets of $85 million consists primarily of the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets from the sale
of the Winter Sports business ($59.1 million) and the writedown of carrying values of net assets from the sale of the firebuilding and Teutonia

®

stroller businesses ($15.3 million).

Consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 8.3%. The decrease in aforementioned inventory

step-up

charge related to the Jarden Acquisition, the impact of increased net sales and the benefits of synergies and productivity, as well as a reduction in bonus expense, were mostly offset by the negative mix
effects related to the Jarden Acquisition, increased investment related to the expansion of brand development,

E-commerce

and insights, as well as costs associated with the delivery of synergies, the increase
in the impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets and the acquisition-related increase in amortization of intangibles.



The increase in interest expense for 2017 was primarily due to higher average debt levels versus the same prior
year period. The weighted average interest rate for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 4.0% and 3.7%, respectively.

As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
in the United States, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.5 billion due to statutory tax rate changes in the United States and an $87.2 million tax benefit to reverse the Company’s
deferred tax liability on historical Jarden earnings, partially offset by a $195 million tax expense relating to a mandatory repatriation tax. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income
taxes.

The increase in net
sales for 2017 was primarily due to acquisitions (approximately 23%) and strong growth in the baby gear category, partially offset by softness in the Appliance and Cookware categories.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 10.3% and 10.4%, respectively. The impact of the 2016 inventory

step-up

charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $166 million) and a reduction in bonus expense, was more than offset by the negative mix impact of the Jarden Acquisition, and the acquisition-related
increase in amortization of intangibles, as well as the impact of incremental promotional activity.

Learn

The increase in net sales for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 9%) and an increase in sales in the Writing business, in part due
to increases in Elmer’s glue sales, partially offset by decreases in other Writing categories due to inventory reductions at certain mass market retailers and a decline in the Fine Art category.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 18.4% and 21.3%, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by the mix
impact of the Jarden Acquisition, as well as the unfavorable impact of product mix due to the growth of Elmer’s glue sales within the Writing business, increased advertising and promotion costs, and fire-related losses at a Writing warehouse in
Mexico, partially offset by the impact of the 2016 inventory

step-up

charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $53 million) and a reduction in bonus expense.

Work

The increase in net sales for 2017 was primarily
due to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 18%), and growth in the Safety and Security and Waddington categories.

Operating income as a percentage of
net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 14.8% and 12.6%, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory

step-up

charge related to the Jarden Acquisition
(approximately $65 million), benefits of cost synergies and a reduction in bonus expense.

Play

The increase in net sales for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 35%) with the balance of growth generated primarily by the
Beverage, Coleman, Team Sports and Technical Apparel categories, primarily due to increased demand.



Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 10.3% and 2.2%, respectively.
The increase was primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory

step-up

charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $148 million), cost synergies, and a reduction in bonus expense.

Other

The decrease in net sales for 2017 was primarily
due to impact of divestitures (approximately 55%), partially offset by the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 15%).

Operating income as a percentage of net
sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 1.1% and 9.5%, respectively. The change was affected by an increase in the impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets (approximately $70 million), the impact of divestitures, and other costs that
are primarily related to assets held for sale, partially offset by the impact of the 2016 inventory

step-up

charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $48 million).

The
increase in net sales for 2016 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 123%). Net sales were also favorably impacted by volume growth, pricing and the acquisition of Elmer’s. Net sales were adversely affected by foreign
currency, divestitures and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015.

Gross margin as a percentage of net
sales for 2016 and 2015 was 33.2% and 39.0% respectively. The decrease was driven primarily by the negative impact of the charge for the inventory

step-up

related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $480
million), foreign currency, the mix effect of the Jarden Acquisition and deconsolidation of Venezuelan operations, partially offset by the benefits of productivity, input cost deflation and pricing.

The increase in SG&A for the for 2016 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition. The increase was also driven by $261 million of costs during 2016
associated with the acquisition and integration of Jarden and an increase in incentive-related and other compensation costs. These increases were partially offset by overhead cost savings from Project Renewal, $10.0 million of SG&A costs
associated with the Graco product recall during 2015, a $41.5 million decrease in Project Renewal-related SG&A costs, which decreased from $78.0 million for 2015 to $36.5 million for 2016, and the impacts of foreign currency.

Restructuring costs for 2016 primarily related to the integration of Jarden and Project Renewal and consisted mostly of employee severance, termination
benefits and employee relocation costs. Restructuring costs for 2015 primarily related to Project Renewal and consisted of $6.7 million of facility and other exit costs, including impairments, $54.9 million of employee severance,
termination benefits and employee relocation costs and $15.6 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs. See Footnote 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2016 and 2015 was 8.3% and 10.2%, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to the charge for the
inventory

step-up

related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $480 million) and the SG&A costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Jarden (approximately $261 million).

The increase in interest expense, net, for 2016 was primarily due to increased debt levels versus the prior year attributable to the Jarden Acquisition.

The increase in net
sales for 2016 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition and growth in North America and Asia Pacific due to new product launches and advertising and promotion investment.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2016 and 2015 was approximately 10.4% and 12.9%, respectively. The decrease is primarily driven by the
impact of the 2016 inventory

step-up

charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $166 million) and the negative mix impact of the Jarden Acquisition, partially offset by productivity, product mix,
the Graco product recall in 2015 and acquisition costs incurred in the prior year period.

Learn

The increase in net sales for 2016 was primarily due to the Jarden and Elmer’s acquisitions, increased advertising and promotion, robust merchandising
efforts, overall

innovation-led

growth, and volume and distribution gains. Net sales were negatively affected by the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan operations and unfavorable foreign currency translation.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2016 and 2015 was approximately 21.3% and 24.3%, respectively. The decrease is primarily driven by the

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $486 million, of which approximately $401 million was held by the
Company’s

non-U.S.

subsidiaries. Overall, the Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from future operations, access to capital markets, and availability under its
revolving credit facility and receivables purchase agreement will be adequate to support the cash needs of the Company. The Company intends to use available cash, borrowing capacity, cash flows from future operations and alternative financing
arrangements to invest in capital expenditures in support of the Company’s growth platforms, to maintain its dividend per share and to repay debt maturities as they come due and to complete its ongoing restructuring initiatives.

Cash and cash equivalents increased as follows for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

The Company tends to generate the majority of its operating cash flow in third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal
variations in operating results, the timing of annual performance-based compensation payments, working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The change
in net cash provided by operations for 2017 is in part due to operating cash flows that were unusually high in 2016 driven by substantial benefits that do not repeat in the current year related to the Jarden Acquisition, including the absence of
seasonal cash outflows for the legacy Jarden businesses, prior to the transaction; an increase in cash interest paid (approximately $143 million); an increase in make-whole interest and fees related to the extinguishment of debt (approximately $34
million); an increase in integration-related costs (approximately $137 million), an increase in cash taxes paid (approximately $73 million) and unfavorable working capital movements primarily related to the timing of inventory purchases.

The change in net cash provided by operations for 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the operating cash flow attributable to the Jarden Acquisition based
on favorable timing of the acquisition during the second quarter, partially offset by higher interest payments associated with higher debt levels resulting from financing the Jarden Acquisition, transaction costs associated with the Jarden
Acquisition (approximately $52 million) and higher annual incentive compensation (approximately $32 million) paid in March 2016 relating to the Company’s 2015 performance.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

The change
in cash provided by (used in) investing activities for 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (approximately $8 billion), primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition and a
$1.9 billion increase in the proceeds from the sale of businesses. For 2017, capital expenditures were $406 million versus $441 million for 2016.

The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities for 2016 was primarily due to an increase in cash used for the acquisition of businesses, net of
cash acquired (approximately $8.1 billion), primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition, partially offset by the cash impact of the 2015 deconsolidation of the Venezuelan operations (approximately $98 million). For 2016, capital expenditures were
$441 million versus $211 million for 2015.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for 2017 was primarily due to the decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of long-term
debt, primarily used to fund the Jarden Acquisition, in excess of payments on long-term debt (approximately $9.8 billion) an increase in cash dividends paid (approximately $100 million), an increase in the repurchase of shares of the Company
(approximately $152 million) and cash paid to dissenting former Jarden shareholders (approximately $162 million), partially offset by the period-over-period increase in the net change in short-term debt (approximately $753 million).

The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for 2016 was primarily due to the increase in the proceeds from the issuance of long-term
debt, primarily used to fund the Jarden Acquisition, in excess of payments on long-term debt (approximately $7.7 billion) and a decrease in the repurchase of common stock (approximately $180 million), partially offset by the period-over-period
decrease in the net change in short-term debt (approximately $584 million) and an increase in dividends paid (approximately $122 million).



Capital Resources

In March 2017, the Company commenced the Tender Offers totaling approximately $1.06 billion for any and all of its 6.25% senior notes due 2018 and up to a
maximum aggregate principal amount of certain of its other senior notes. In March 2017, pursuant to the Tender Offers, the Company repurchased approximately $63 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2018,
approximately $733 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.6% senior notes due 2019 and approximately $76 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.70% senior notes due 2020 for total consideration, excluding accrued interest, of
approximately $897 million. As a result of these debt extinguishments, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $27.8 million during the first quarter of 2017, primarily comprised of prepayment premiums and a

non-cash

charge due to the

write-off

of deferred debt issuance costs.

In April
2017, the Company redeemed the remaining approximately $187 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2018 for total consideration, excluding accrued interest of approximately $195 million. As a result of this debt
extinguishment, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $4.5 million during the second quarter of 2017, primarily comprised of prepayment premiums, partially offset by the

write-off

of a deferred gain on previously terminated interest rate swaps.

The Company maintains a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that matures in
January 2022 (the “Facility”). Under the Facility, the Company may borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The Facility also provides for the issuance of up to $100 million of letters of credit, so long as there is a
sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Facility. At December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding under the Facility and net availability was approximately $1.2 billion.

The Company maintains a $950 million receivables purchase agreement that matures in October 2019 (the “Securitization Facility”) and bears
interest at a margin over a variable interest rate. At December 31, 2017, the borrowing rate margin and the unused line fee on the Securitization Facility were 0.80% and 0.40% per annum, respectively. At December 31, 2017, net availability
under the Facility was approximately $623 million.

The Company was not in default of any of its debt covenants at December 31, 2017.

In September 2017, the Company announced that it is reinstating its SRP that the Company voluntarily suspended in the fourth quarter of 2015 in association
with the Jarden Acquisition. On November 2, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an extension and expansion to the Company’s existing SRP. Under the updated SRP, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to
approximately $1.26 billion of its outstanding shares through the end of 2020. The repurchase of additional shares in the future will depend upon many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and legal requirements.
During 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 5 million shares of its common stock under the SRP valued at approximately $152 million. At December 31, 2017, approximately $1.1 billion remains available under the SRP.

At December 31, 2017, there were approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock that had not been issued and $61 million
in cash that had not been paid to the former holders of Jarden shares who are exercising their right to judicial appraisal under Delaware law. Absent consent by the Company, these dissenting shareholders are no longer entitled to the merger
consideration, but are instead entitled only to the judicially determined fair value of their shares, plus interest accruing from the date of the Jarden Acquisition, payable in cash. However, it is possible that the Company could issue a consent to
or reach agreement with one or more of these shareholders resulting in the issuance of Company shares (in lieu of or along with the payment of cash) in settlement of the dissenters’ claims. In July 2017, approximately 6.6 million shares of
the Company’s common stock (representing the stock component of the merger consideration) were issued and approximately $162 million (representing the cash component of the merger consideration) was paid to certain former dissenting
shareholders in full settlement of their claims. At December 31, 2017, the Company has accrued approximately $171 million of unpaid consideration related to these former shares of Jarden common stock.

Risk Management

From time to time, the Company
enters into derivative transactions to hedge its exposures to interest rate, foreign currency rate and commodity price fluctuations. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Contracts

The Company manages its
fixed and floating rate debt mix using interest rate swaps. The Company may use fixed and floating rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for
interest. Floating rate swaps would be used, depending on market conditions, to convert the fixed rates of long-term debt into short-term variable rates. Fixed rate swaps would be used to reduce the Company’s risk of the possibility of
increased interest costs. Interest rate swap contracts are therefore used by the Company to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision. The cash paid and received from the settlement of interest rate swaps is included in
interest expense.



Fair Value Hedges

At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $527 million notional amount of interest rate swaps that exchange a fixed rate of interest for
variable rate (LIBOR) of interest plus a weighted average spread. These floating rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges against $277 million of principal on the 4.70% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 and $250 million of principal
on the 4.00% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 for the remaining life of these notes. The effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these swaps is offset by fair value adjustments in the underlying debt.

Cross-Currency Contracts

The Company uses
cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency risk on certain intercompany financing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, the notional value of outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps was approximately
$160 million. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are intended to eliminate uncertainty in cash flows in U.S. Dollars and British Pounds in connection with the intercompany financing arrangements. The effective portions of the changes in
fair values of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI’) and an amount is reclassified out of AOCI into other (income) expense, net, in the consolidated statement of
operations in the same period that the carrying value of the underlying foreign currency intercompany financing arrangements are remeasured.

Foreign Currency Contracts

The Company uses
forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales and have maturity dates through September 2018. The derivatives used to hedge these
forecasted transactions that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gains or losses on these derivatives is deferred as a component of AOCI and is recognized in earnings at the same
time that the hedged item affects earnings and is included in the same caption in the statements of operations as the underlying hedged item. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $260 million notional amount outstanding of
forward foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted inventory purchases and sales.

The Company also uses foreign
currency contracts, primarily forward foreign currency contracts, to mitigate the foreign currency exposure of certain other foreign currency transactions. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion notional amount
outstanding of these foreign currency contracts that are not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and have maturity dates through November 2018. Fair market value gains or losses are included in the statements of operations and are
classified in other (income) expense, net.

Sheet Arrangements

The Company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2046. Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory
contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed. Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are
commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2017, and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements.

The increase in interest expense, net, for 2016 was primarily due to increased debt levels versus the prior year attributable to the Jarden Acquisition.



The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations is expected to

(6)

Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2017 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long-term debt, short-term debt and accrued interest.

The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits. The Company is under audit from

time-to-time

by the IRS and other taxing authorities, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could
change in the coming year. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time;
therefore, the $368 million in unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017 is excluded from the preceding table. See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are excluded from the preceding table. The
timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets, among other factors. See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $72.2 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Company’s
self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product liability and medical. See Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any significant

off-balance

sheet arrangements, as defined in
Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation

S-K.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in that footnote,
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from
those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections describe the Company’s critical accounting policies.



Sales Recognition

Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer, which generally occurs
either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms. Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales-related discounts.

Customer Programs

The Company participates in various
programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers. Among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreed-upon sales levels or for
participating in specific marketing programs. Coupon programs are also developed on a customer- and territory-specific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers.

Under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance, the Company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit
or contractual sales volume. When incentives are paid in arrears, the Company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms, expected customer performance and/or estimated sales volume. These estimates are
determined using historical customer experience and other factors, which sometimes require significant judgment. Due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers, among other factors, actual amounts paid can differ from
these estimates.

Recovery of Accounts Receivable

The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. When aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet
its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount
the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience.
Accounts are reviewed for potential

write-off

on a

case-by-case

basis. Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of
expected recoveries. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.

Inventory Reserves

The Company reduces its inventory
value for estimated obsolete and slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are
less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Business Combinations

The Company allocates purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair
values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company makes
significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not
limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and acquired patents and developed technology; the period of time the Company expects to use the acquired intangible asset; and discount rates. In
estimating the future cash flows, the Company considers demand, competition and other economic factors. The Company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a
result, actual results may differ from estimates, which could result in impairment charges in the future. Estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, which could result in adjustments to the values of tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired or could result in future income or expenses if such changes in estimates are
identified beyond one year from the date of acquisition.

The Company considers various factors in determining whether an acquired trademark or trade name
has an indefinite life. In assessing whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life, the Company considers legal and regulatory provisions that may limit the useful life, customer loyalty, brand strength and positioning, the
effects of obsolescence and other economic factors, the Company’s plans for incorporating the trademark or trade name into its brand portfolio and the Company’s historical experience in using and renewing similar assets. The Company
considers all other acquired intangible assets definite-lived assets and generally amortizes the assets on a straight-line basis. The Company determines the amortizable life of acquired definite-lived intangible assets based on the number of years
over which a significant amount of the discounted cash flows contributes to the estimated fair value of the asset.



The Company accounts for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from
the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. When estimating
the costs of exiting facilities, estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. As a result, the Company may be required to revise its estimates which may affect the
Company’s results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible
Assets

As a result of acquisitions in prior years, the Company has significant intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles (primarily, trademarks and tradenames). The Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested and reviewed for impairment annually (during the third quarter, which coincides with the Company’s
annual planning process), or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant. In 2017, the Company adopted authoritative accounting guidance that requires that goodwill impairment will now be determined by the amount by which a reporting
unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value (not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill), which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test that required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to calculate an impairment.

The Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level, and all of the Company’s goodwill is assigned to the
Company’s reporting units. Reporting units are generally one level below the operating segment level. As a result of the integration of businesses from the Jarden Acquisition and related changes to management, the Company identified 18
reporting units, comprising the Company’s five operating segments. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2017, at which date the Company’s total goodwill was $10.5 billion. Additionally, the
carrying value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $10.2 billion as of the July 1, 2017.

The Company
uses a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining
whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The qualitative approach, which was only applied to a portion of the Company’s reporting units, assesses various factors including, in part, the macroeconomic
environment, industry and market specific conditions, financial performance, operating costs and cost impacts, as well as issues or events specific to the reporting unit. If necessary, the next step in the goodwill impairment test involves comparing
the fair value of each of the reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss would be recognized (not to exceed the carrying
amount of goodwill). Due to changes in the Company’s reportable segments resulting from the integration of businesses from the Jarden acquisition and significant future projected synergies, the Company proceeded directly to quantitative
impairment testing for nearly all its reporting units.

Both qualitative and quantitative goodwill impairment testing requires significant use of judgment
and assumptions, including the identification of reporting units; the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; and the estimation of future cash flows, business growth rates, terminal values and discount rates. The Company uses
various valuation methods, such as the discounted cash flow and market multiple methods. The income approach used is the discounted cash flow methodology and is based on five-year cash flow projections. The cash flows projected are analyzed on a
“debt-free” basis (before cash payments to equity and interest bearing debt investors) in order to develop an enterprise value from operations for the reporting unit. A provision is also made, based on these projections, for the value of
the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period, or terminal value. The present value of the finite-period cash flows and the terminal value are determined using a selected discount rate. The market multiple methodology involves estimating
value based on the trading multiples for comparable public companies. Multiples are determined through an analysis of certain publicly traded companies that are selected on the basis of operational and economic similarity with the business
operations. Valuation multiples are calculated for the comparable companies based on daily trading prices. A comparative analysis between the reporting unit and the public companies forms the basis for the selection of appropriate risk-adjusted
multiples. The comparative analysis incorporates both quantitative and qualitative risk factors which relate to, among other things, the nature of the industry in which the reporting unit and other comparable companies are engaged.

The Company uses a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether
it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. The Company applied this qualitative approach to select
indefinite-lived intangible assets. For the majority of the other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company proceeded directly to quantitative impairment testing.

The testing of indefinite-lived intangibles under established guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions (such as
cash flow projections, terminal values and discount rates). For impairment testing purposes, the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is determined using the same method which was used for determining the initial value. The first method is the
relief from royalty method, which estimates the value of a tradename by discounting the hypothetical avoided royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset. The second method is the excess earnings method, which
estimates the value of



the intangible asset by quantifying the residual (or excess) cash flows generated by the asset, and discounting those cash flows to the present. The excess earnings methodology requires the
application of contributory asset charges. Contributory asset charges typically include assumed payments for the use of working capital, tangible assets and other intangible assets. Changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could
materially affect the estimated fair values. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations.

As a result
of the 2017 annual impairment testing, the enterprise value of all of the Company’s reporting units except the Winter Sports reporting unit exceeded their carrying values by more than approximately 10%; however, changes in business conditions
and assumptions could potentially require future adjustments to these asset valuations.

The Company’s Winter Sports reporting unit was a business
held for sale as of the impairment testing date. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business and used the estimated purchase price (approximately $200 million, net of working capital
adjustments) to approximate the enterprise value of the Winter Sports reporting unit. Since the carrying value exceeded the estimated enterprise value of the Winter Sports reporting unit, the Company recorded an impairment charge for goodwill and
other intangible assets during second quarter of 2017.

As a result of the annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles assets as of July 1,
2017, the Company determined that none of the indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. Should projected revenues and cash flows not be achieved, estimated fair values could be reduced to below carrying values resulting in potential future
material

non-cash

impairment charges.

The estimated fair values for certain trade names within the Live and Other
segments exceeded their carrying values by less than a 10% threshold. This primarily relates to trade names from the recent Jarden acquisition that were valued using the relief from royalty method and those tradenames with projected cashflows that
are similar to the initial projection amounts used within the initial valuation.

The Company performed the quantitative impairment test for a trade name
with a carrying value of $2.0 billion within the Appliances & Cookware reporting unit, noting the fair value exceeded the carrying value by $175 million, or approximately 9%. The Company concluded that this trade name is not
impaired. However, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately $165 million, or approximately 8%.

In addition, the Company performed the quantitative impairment test for a trade name with a carrying value of $208 million within the Food reporting unit,
noting the fair value exceeded the carrying value by $4.7 million, or approximately 2%. The Company concluded that this trade name is not impaired. However, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an
impairment of approximately $32 million, or approximately 15%, and a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately $38 million, or approximately 18%.

The Company also performed the quantitative impairment test for a trade name with a carrying value of $81.0 million within the Gaming reporting unit,
noting the fair value exceeded the carrying value by $6.2 million, or approximately 8%. The Company concluded that this trade name is not impaired. However, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an
impairment of approximately $10 million, or approximately 12%, and a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately $11 million, or approximately 14%.

While some of the Company’s businesses experienced a revenue decline and decreased profitability in 2017, the Company believes that its long-term growth
strategy coupled with projected synergies and cost savings resulting from the Jarden Acquisition supports its fair value conclusions. For both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the recoverability of these amounts is dependent upon
achievement of the Company’s projections and the execution of key initiatives related to revenue growth and improved profitability.

Some of the
inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, credit ratings, foreign exchange rates, labor inflation, and
industry growth. While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, it is possible changes could occur. As for all of the
Company’s reporting units, if in future years, the reporting unit’s actual results are not consistent with the Company’s estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, the Company may be required to recognize material
impairments to goodwill. The Company will continue to monitor its reporting units for any triggering events or other signs of impairment. The Company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment
and other factors, which could result in impairment charges in the future. Although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur, if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future
or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels, it is reasonably likely the Company will be required to record impairment charges in the future. Additionally, there are significant synergy savings
projected for the Company as a result of the Jarden Acquisition.



Subsequent Events

In January 2018, the Company announced it is exploring strategic options for its industrial and commercial product assets, including Waddington, Process
Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Mapa, as well as the smaller consumer businesses, including Rawlings, Goody, Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage, and U.S. Playing Cards. The estimated selling price for each of these
businesses is subject to many factors, including but not limited to, the number of potential buyers, buyer’s strategic fit and synergies and nature of the sales transaction. The Company may incur future impairment charges if the carrying
value of the business exceeds its estimated sales price.

Capitalized Software Costs

The Company capitalizes costs associated with

internal-use

software during the application development stage after both
the preliminary project stage has been completed and the Company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development. Capitalized

internal-use

software costs include:
(i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software; (ii) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project; and
(iii) interest costs incurred while developing the software. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose. The Company expenses as incurred
research and development, general and administrative, and indirect costs associated with

internal-use

software. In addition, the Company expenses as incurred training, maintenance and other

internal-use

software costs incurred during the post-implementation stage. Costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of

internal-use

software are capitalized only if
such modifications result in additional functionality of the software.

The Company amortizes

internal-use

software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment, including but not limited to a significant change in available technology
or the manner in which the software is being used. Impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values.

Other Long-Lived Assets

The Company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present. These
impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical
condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If impairment
indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are
estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses, working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Company’s forecasts. If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future
cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group.
Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.

Product Liability Reserves

The Company has a
self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of
significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves. The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the
Company’s product liability reserve. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material
to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Legal and Environmental Reserves

The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other
disputes. The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows. The estimated losses take into
account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. No insurance recovery is taken into account in
determining the Company’s cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long-term operations and maintenance, Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and other matters which are estimated at present value.



Income Taxes

In accordance with relevant authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach,
deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the
deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.

The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and
assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax, interest and penalty reserves in
recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering
historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.

For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a “more likely than
not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can
increase or decrease the Company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results.

The Company’s provision for income taxes is subject
to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and
liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in

tax-related

legislation; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by changes in accounting principles; by liquidity
needs driving repatriations of

non-U.S.

cash to the U.S.; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of
expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules.

The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate,
primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign tax rates, tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments. Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions,
determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets, and ultimately, the income tax provision.

It is difficult to predict when
resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate, and the Company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the
effects of similar items. For example, if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved, the Company will recognize period tax benefits. Conversely, to the extent tax matters
are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved, the Company will recognize incremental period tax expense. These matters are expected to contribute to the tax
rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate.

See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits

The Company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions,
including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current
rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. The effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are
reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors. The pension and postretirement obligations are measured as of December 31 for 2017 and 2016.

The Company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments
are used to maximize the long-term return of pension plan assets. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan
liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. The investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across geography and market
capitalization through investments in U.S. large-capitalization stocks, U.S. small-capitalization stocks and international securities. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic
asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.



The expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset
allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions, risk and active management premiums. The target asset allocations for the Company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan, based in part due to plan
demographics, funded status and liability duration. In general, the Company’s target asset allocations for the domestic pension plans are as follows: equities approximately 25% to 40%; bonds approximately 20% to 40%; and cash, alternative
investments and other, approximately 25% to 45% as of December 31, 2017. Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of transactions. The Company maintains
numerous international defined benefit pension plans. The asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile. At December 31, 2017,
the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows: Equities: approximately 23% and Other Investments (alternative investments, fixed-income securities, cash and other): approximately 77%. Cash and other asset levels were higher than normal at
December 31, 2017, due to the impending merger of domestic defined benefit pension plans effective January 1, 2018, and the liquidation of certain assets in advance of the merger. These assets were subsequently invested in January
2018 in accordance with the Company’s target asset allocations.

For 2017, 2016 and 2015, the actual return (loss) on plan assets for the
Company’s U.S. pension plan assets was approximately $172 million, $71 million and $(14) million, respectively, versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately $73 million, $69 million and $58 million,
respectively. The actual amount of future contributions will depend, in part, on long-term actual return on assets and future discount rates. Pension contributions for all the Company’s pension plans for 2018 are estimated to be approximately
$30 million, compared to approximately $29 million in 2017.

The weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2017 was
approximately 4.9% for the Company’s pension plans. The weighted average discount rate at the 2017 measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 3.1% and 3.3%, respectively. A 25 basis
points decrease in the discount rate at the 2017 measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately $71 million.

The healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the Company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends
and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers. At the 2017 measurement date, the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 6.7%. The current healthcare cost trend rate gradually decreases to an ultimate
healthcare cost trend rate of 4.5%. A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the postretirement benefit obligation or the service and interest cost components of postretirement benefit
costs.

See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s pension and
postretirement benefit plans.

Restructuring

The
Company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities, which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and
other separation programs, realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete, lease cancellation costs, sublease income and other exit costs, including environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities. The Company
accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these activities when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans,
historical experience and previously negotiated settlements. The Company accrues for future lease costs, net of management’s estimate for future sublease income, when the leased property has been vacated and is no longer being used. When
estimating the costs of exiting facilities, estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results and result in additional restructuring costs in future periods. Environmental and legal
contingencies associated with restructuring activities are accrued when the liability is probable of being incurred and is estimable.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

In general, business enterprises can be
exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices, and that can affect the cost of operating, investing and financing under those conditions. The Company believes it has
moderate exposure to these risks. The Company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash
flows based on hypothetical changes in rates and prices.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its
fixed rate debt. As such, the Company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to
minimize interest costs. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $1.1 billion of the Company’s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps. The remainder of the debt
(approximately $9.4 billion) carries a fixed rate of interest. Based upon the Company’s debt structure at December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 1% increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately
$11 million and decrease the fair values of debt by approximately $743 million.

While the Company transacts business predominantly in U.S.
dollars and most of its revenues are collected in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of the Company’s operating costs are denominated in other currencies, such as the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese Renminbi, European
Euro, Japanese Yen and Mexican Peso. Changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect Company’s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses. For 2017, approximately 29% of the Company’s
sales were denominated in foreign currencies, the most significant of which were: European Euro-approximately 8.0%; and Canadian dollar-approximately 5.8%. The primary purpose of the Company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate
the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses
related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.

The Company is exposed to the price
risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials. As such, the Company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the Company enters into commodity-based derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the
rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the Company’s raw materials. A hypothetical 10% change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included
in the Company’s results of operations. In this sensitivity analysis, all other assumptions are constant and assumes that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not impact another currency’s rates relative
to the U.S. dollar.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of

non-performance

by the counterparties
to its derivative financial instruments, all of which are highly rated institutions; however, the Company does not anticipate

non-performance

by such counterparties.

The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.



ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Newell Brands Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s
management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making its assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

(2013). Based on the results of its evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the consolidated financial statements of Newell Brands Inc. as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the effectiveness of Newell Brands Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2017. Their integrated audit report is presented herein.

NEWELL BRANDS INC.

Hoboken, New Jersey

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the

Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newell Brands Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newell Brands Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and December 31,
2016,

and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes and schedule of
valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017

in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our
audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated

financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

. The Company’s multi-product
offering consists of well-known, name brand consumer and commercial products. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company changed its reporting structure and began reporting its financial results in five business segments: Live, Learn, Work, Play
and Other (See Footnote 18 for additional information). All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current reporting structure.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial
statements include the consolidated accounts of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions
and balances.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
these consolidated financial statements requires the use of certain estimates by management in determining the Company’s assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Other Items

The Company holds a 23.4% investment in
Sprue Aegis (“Sprue”). During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s related party sales to Sprue were $33.5 million and $23.2 million, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the income attributable to

non-controlling

interests was
$2.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company provided notification to Sprue of its election to terminate the distribution agreement on March 31, 2018.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company sells products
to customers in diversified industries and geographic regions and, therefore, has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Company continuously evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers and generally does not require collateral.

The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. When aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet
its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount
the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience.
Accounts are also reviewed for potential

write-off

on a

case-by-case

basis. Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of
expected recoveries. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.

The Company’s forward exchange contracts do not subject the Company to risk due to foreign exchange rate movement, because gains and losses on these
instruments generally offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and other transactions being hedged. The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of

non-performance

by counterparties
to certain derivative financial instruments. The Company does not obtain collateral or other security to support derivative financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit standing of the counterparties.



Sales Recognition and Customer Programs

Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change, which generally occurs
either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms. Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales-related discounts and
programs.

Under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance, the Company amortizes the amount paid over the
period of benefit or contractual sales volume. When incentives are paid in arrears, the Company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms, expected customer performance and/or estimated sales volume.

The Company sells gift cards to customers in its retail stores, third-party retail stores and through consumer direct operations. Gift cards do not have an
expiration date. At the point of sale of a gift card, the Company records deferred revenue. Gift card revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed by the customer or the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote
(“gift card breakage”). Gift card breakage income is recognized in proportion to the actual redemption of gift cards based on the Company’s historical redemption pattern and is included in net sales in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments that have a maturity of three months or less when purchased.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
or market value using the

last-in,

first-out

(LIFO) or

first-in,

first-out

(FIFO) methods
(see Footnote 6 for additional information). The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon
estimates about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation expense is calculated principally on the straight-line basis. Useful lives determined by the Company are as follows: buildings and
improvements (20 - 40 years) and machinery and equipment (3 - 15 years).

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company conducts its annual test for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter because it coincides with its
annual strategic planning process.

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level. The Company also tests for
impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value, impairment may be
present. The Company assesses the fair value of each reporting unit for its goodwill impairment test based on a discounted cash flow model, an earnings multiple or an actual sales offer received from a prospective buyer, if available. Estimates
critical to the Company’s fair value estimates using earnings multiples include the projected financial performance of the reporting unit and the applicable earnings multiple. Estimates critical to the Company’s fair value estimates under
the discounted cash flow model include projected financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit, the discount rate, long-term sales growth rate, product costs and the working capital investment required.

The Company measures the amount of any goodwill impairment based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit,
including any unrecognized intangible assets, and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.

The Company evaluates indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and trade names) for impairment annually. The Company also tests for impairment
if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is below its carrying amount. Estimates critical to the Company’s evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets
for impairment include the discount rate, royalty rates used in its evaluation of trade names, projected average revenue growth and projected long-term growth rates in the determination of terminal values. An impairment charge is recorded if the
carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date.

See Footnote 8 for additional detail on
goodwill and other intangible assets.



Other Long-Lived Assets

The Company tests its other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance. The Company evaluates if impairment indicators
related to its property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present. These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent
or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing
losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group. If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets. The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to
the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount. The cash flows are estimated utilizing various projections of sales and expenses, working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the strategic plan. If
the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company determines the assets’ fair value by discounting the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an
impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group. Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash
flows are available.

Shipping and Handling Costs

The Company records shipping and handling costs as a component of cost of products sold.

Product Liability Reserves

The Company has a
self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance. The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of
significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves. The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the
Company’s product liability reserve. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material
to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Product Warranties

In the normal course of business, the Company offers warranties for a variety of its products. The specific terms and conditions of the warranties vary
depending upon the specific product and markets in which the products were sold. The Company accrues for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale based on historical experience.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses production costs
of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place, and the Company expenses all other advertising and marketing costs when incurred. Advertising and promotion costs are recorded in selling,
general and administrative expenses and totaled $587 million, $431 million and $214 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development
costs relating to both future and current products are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. These costs totaled $224 million, $188 million and $113 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial
instruments are generally used to manage certain commodity, interest rate and foreign currency risks. These instruments primarily include interest rate swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, forward exchange contracts and options. The
Company’s forward exchange contracts and options do not subject the Company to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these instruments generally offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and other transactions being hedged.
However, these instruments, when settled, impact the Company’s cash flows from operations to the extent the underlying transaction being hedged is not simultaneously settled due to an extension, a renewal or otherwise.

On the date when the Company enters into a derivative, the derivative is designated as a hedge of the identified exposure. The Company measures effectiveness
of its hedging relationships both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis.



Foreign Currency Operations

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at

year-end.

The related translation adjustments are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Income and expenses are translated at the average monthly rates of exchange in effect during
the year. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations and are generally classified in other (income) expense, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Foreign currency transaction net losses for
2017, 2016 and 2015 were $11.0 million, $2.2 million and $17.9 million, respectively.

The Company designates certain foreign currency
denominated, long-term intercompany financing transactions as being of a long-term investment nature and records gains and losses on the transactions arising from changes in exchange rates as translation adjustments.

Venezuelan Operations

Until December 31, 2015, the
Company accounted for its Venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting, and therefore, the Company remeasured assets, liabilities, sales and expenses denominated in Bolivar Fuertes (“Bolivars”) into U.S. Dollars using the
applicable exchange rate, and the resulting translation adjustments were included in earnings. As of December 31, 2015, the Company determined it could no longer exercise control over its Venezuela operations because the availability of U.S.
Dollars had declined significantly over the past several years in each of Venezuela’s three exchange mechanisms. As a result, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan operations.

Prior to the deconsolidation of the Venezuela operations on December 31, 2015, the results of the Company’s Venezuelan operations have been included
in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2015 and all prior periods. As of December 31, 2015, the Company began accounting for its investment in its Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting, and the cost
basis was adjusted to nil as of December 31, 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Venezuelan operations generated 2.2% of
consolidated net sales and $51.1 million of the Company’s reported annual operating income, respectively.

As a result of deconsolidating its
Venezuelan operations, the Company recorded a charge of $173 million in 2015. The charge consisted of the

write-off

of the Company’s Venezuelan operations’ net assets of $74.7 million, as
well as $58.3 million of Venezuela receivable-related assets held by other subsidiaries, resulting in $133 million of total charges associated with the deconsolidation of Venezuela’s net assets. In addition, in accordance with
applicable accounting standards for foreign currency and the transition to the cost method for Venezuela’s operations, the Company was required to

write-off

the currency translation adjustment that arose
prior to the application of hyperinflationary accounting in 2010 that was included in other comprehensive loss in equity. The

write-off

of the currency translation adjustment resulted in a

pre-tax

charge of $39.7 million.

Since the Company holds all of the equity interests but does not have the power
to direct the activities that most significantly affect the Venezuelan entity’s economic performance, the Company considers the Venezuelan entity a variable interest entity for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company has
determined that the Venezuelan entity’s assets can only be used to settle its obligations. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has no outstanding exposures or commitments with respect to its Venezuelan operations. Further, dividends and
payments for intercompany receivables due from the Company’s Venezuelan operations will be recorded as other income upon receipt.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based
on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will
more likely than not be realized.

The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by
various worldwide tax authorities. Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax, interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may
challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable
income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.

The authoritative guidance requires
application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions
require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company’s effective tax rate, as well as impact operating results.



Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense is adjusted for estimated forfeitures and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the
award, which is generally three years for stock options and one to three years for restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units. The Company estimates future forfeiture rates based on its historical experience. See Footnote 15
for additional information.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Changes to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in
the form of accounting standards updates (“ASUs”) to the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2014-09,

“Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(Topic
606)

.” The FASB also issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard. As amended, the new revenue standard will replace existing revenue recognition requirements in U.S. GAAP and will require entities to recognize revenue
at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. To achieve this core principle, the standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to
determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable
consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The new revenue standard will also require significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of the Company’s
nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

The Company adopted the new standard on
January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method and applying this approach to those contracts that were not completed as of that date. The Company is substantially complete with its business process reviews and changes to
its controls to support recognition and disclosures under the new guidance. The Company does not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and mainly expects presentation changes in the
balance sheet and income statement from the transition to the new revenue standard, primarily due to reclassifications of certain costs and cash payments made to customers previously recorded in costs of products sold and selling, general and
administrative expenses, with no impact on net income.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU

2016-02,

“

Leases (Topic 842)

,” which requires lessees to recognize a

right-of-use

asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months.
Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. ASU

2016-02

is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU

2016-02

on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In
March 2017, the FASB issued ASU

2017-07,

“Compensation

— Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement
Benefit Cost.”

ASU

2017-07

changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. ASU

2017-07

requires that the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during
the period. Other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented. ASU

2017-07

also allows only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization, when applicable. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption
permitted. ASU

2017-07

is to be applied retrospectively for the income statement presentation requirements and prospectively for the capitalization requirements of the service cost component. The Company does
not expect that the adoption of ASU

2017-17

will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU

2017-12,

“

Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to
Accounting for Hedging Activities.”

ASU

2017-12

amends existing guidance to better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships. ASU

2017-12

also expands and refines hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the
financial statements. ASU

2017-12

is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is beginning to evaluate
the impact the adoption of ASU

2017-22

will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In
February 2018, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2018-02,

“

Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income.”

ASU

No. 2018-02

provides companies with an option to reclassify stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings in each period
in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (or portion thereof) is recorded. ASU

No. 2018-02

also requires disclosure of a description of
the accounting policy for releasing income tax



effects from AOCI and whether an election was made to reclassify the stranded income tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ASU

No. 2018-02

is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Companies can adopt the provisions of ASU

2018-02

in either the
period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. The Company is beginning to evaluate the impact the
adoption of ASU

2018-02

will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Other recently issued
ASUs were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have a minimal impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Adoption of New Accounting Guidance

In January 2017, the
FASB issued ASU

2017-04,

“Intangibles — Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.”

ASU

2017-04

simplifies the subsequent
measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. ASU

2017-04

is effective for annual or interim impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early
adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted ASU

2017-04

during the third quarter of 2017 in connection with
its annual goodwill impairment testing.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2016-09,

“Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.”

ASU

2016-09

provides guidance intended to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The
new standard requires: (1) excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based awards to be recognized as income tax benefit or expense on a prospective basis in the reporting period in which they vest; (2) excess tax benefits
from share-based payment arrangements to be presented within operating activities and withholding tax payments upon vesting of restricted stock units to be presented within financing activities within the cash flow statement; (3) permits the
employer to repurchase more of an employee’s shares for tax withholding purposes and not classify the award as a liability that requires valuation on a

mark-to-market

basis; and (4) allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017
and decided to continue its policy of estimating forfeitures. The Company has also elected to retrospectively reclassify the prior year cash flows related to excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements from financing activities to
operating activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and it did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows
of the Company.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2015-11,

“

Simplifying the Measurement of
Inventory,

” which modified existing requirements regarding measuring

first-in,

first-out

and average cost inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under past
standards, the market amount requires consideration of replacement cost, net realizable value (“NRV”), and NRV less an approximately normal profit margin. ASU

2015-11

replaces market with NRV,
defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This eliminates the need to determine and consider replacement cost or NRV less an approximately
normal profit margin when measuring inventory. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017 and it did not have a
material effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

FOOTNOTE 2

Acquisitions and Mergers

2017 Activity

In September 2017, the Company acquired Chesapeake Bay Candle, a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of premium candles and other home fragrance
products, focused on consumer wellness and natural fragrance, for a cash purchase price of approximately $75 million. Chesapeake Bay Candle is included in the Live segment from the date of acquisition. Net sales and operating income related to
Chesapeake Bay Candle for 2017 were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2017, the Company acquired Sistema
Plastics (“Sistema”), a leading New Zealand based manufacturer and marketer of innovative food storage containers with strong market shares and presence in Australia, New Zealand, U.K. and parts of continental Europe for a cash purchase
price of approximately $472 million. Based on the Company’s independent valuation, the Company allocated the total purchase price, net of cash acquired, to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Based on the purchase price allocation, net of cash acquired, the Company allocated approximately $37 million to identified net assets, $291 million to identified intangible
assets and $144 million to goodwill. Sistema is included in the Live segment from the date of acquisition. Net sales and operating income related to Sistema for 2017 were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



In January 2017, the Company acquired Smith Mountain Industries (“Smith Mountain”), a leading provider
of premium home fragrance products, sold primarily under the WoodWick

®

Candle brand, for a cash purchase price of approximately $100 million. Smith Mountain is included in the Live
segment from the date of acquisition. Net sales and operating income related to Smith Mountain for 2017 were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

2016 Activity

On April 15, 2016, Jarden
Corporation (“Jarden”) became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Newell Brands Inc., as a result of a series of merger transactions (the “Jarden Acquisition”). The Jarden Acquisition was effected pursuant to an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of December 13, 2015 (the “Merger Agreement”), among the Company, Jarden and two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. Following the Jarden Acquisition, the Company was renamed Newell Brands Inc. Jarden
was a leading, global consumer products company with leading brands, such as Yankee Candle

®

,

Crock-Pot

®

, FoodSaver

®

,
Mr. Coffee

®

, Oster

®

, Coleman

®

, First Alert

®

, Rawlings

®

, Jostens

®

,

®

and many others. The Jarden Acquisition enables the Company to scale the enterprise with leading brands in global markets. The scale of the Company in key categories, channels and
geographies enables it to deploy its strategy, which includes advantaged development and commercial capabilities, across a larger set of opportunities to generate accelerated growth and margin expansion. The Jarden Acquisition was accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting, and Jarden’s assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in the Company’s financial statements from the acquisition date. Adjustments made to the purchase price allocation during
2017, primarily relate to goodwill and other intangible assets (see Footnote 8).

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of Jarden common stock was
exchanged for 0.862 of a share of the Company’s common stock plus $21.00 in cash. The total merger consideration, including debt assumed, was approximately $18.7 billion. The aggregate consideration paid or payable to the Jarden
shareholders and convertible note holders was approximately $15.3 billion and was comprised of a cash payment of approximately $5.4 billion, the issuance of 213.9 million common shares of the Company with a fair value of approximately
$9.9 billion and accrued merger consideration of $627 million. The accrued merger consideration at acquisition related to approximately 9.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock that had not been issued and
$222 million in cash that had not been paid as of the date of the acquisition for shares of Jarden common stock held by dissenting Jarden shareholders who exercised their appraisal rights and are seeking an appraisal of such shares. In July
2017, approximately 6.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock (representing the stock component of the merger consideration) were issued and approximately $162 million (representing the cash component of the merger
consideration) was paid to certain dissenting shareholders pursuant to settlement agreements (see Footnote 19). At December 31, 2017, the Company has accrued approximately $171 million of unpaid consideration related to approximately
2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock that have not been issued and approximately $61 million of cash that has not been paid.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden for 2016 as if the Jarden
Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the Company’s consolidated results of operations that would have been reported had the Jarden
Acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2015 and should not be taken as indicative of the Company’s future consolidated results of operations. The Company expects to incur restructuring and other integration costs that are not included
in the pro forma results of operations presented below. Pro forma adjustments are

tax-effected

at the Company’s estimated statutory tax rates.

activity-based adhesive and cutting products that inspire creativity in the classroom, at home, in the office, in



the workshop and at the craft table. Elmer’s is reported as part of the Company’s Learn segment. The Company’s 2015 consolidated statement of operations includes approximately
$36.3 million of net sales related to Elmer’s. Pro forma results of operations of the Company would not be materially different as a result of the Elmer’s acquisition and therefore are not presented.

Other Items

The goodwill associated with the
acquisitions is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisitions. At December 31, 2017, approximately $357 million of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

FOOTNOTE 3

Divestitures and Planned Divestitures

Based on the Company’s strategy to allocate resources to its businesses relative to their growth potential and those with the greater right to
win in the marketplace, the Company determined that certain businesses as described below did not align with the Company’s long-term growth plans, which led to the decisions to divest or cease operations of these businesses.

Discontinued Operations

The Company’s Endicia and
Culinary electrics and retail businesses were classified as discontinued operations based on the Company’s commitment to sell the businesses. During 2015, the Company sold Endicia for net proceeds of $209 million resulting in a pretax gain
of $154 million. During 2015, the Company ceased operations in its Culinary electrics and retail businesses.

Divestitures

On
July 14, 2017, the Company sold its Winter Sports business for a selling price of approximately $240 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. For 2017 and 2016, net sales from the Winter Sports business were not material.
During 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $59.1 million related to the writedown of the carrying value of the net assets of the Winter Sports business based on the expected proceeds to be received. Of this impairment charge,
$12.6 million related to the impairment of goodwill and $46.5 million related to the impairment of other intangible assets. The Company recorded a

pre-tax

loss on sale of $47.6 million driven by
funding the business’ working capital needs and withholding taxes between June 30, 2017 and July 14, 2017, which is included in other expense (income), net in consolidated statement of operations for 2017.

During 2017, the Company sold its Rubbermaid

®

consumer storage totes business, its stroller business
under the Teutonia

®

brand, its Lehigh business, its firebuilding business and its triathlon apparel business under the Zoot

®

and
Squadra

®

brands. The selling prices for these businesses were not material. Based on the consideration, during 2017 the Company recorded impairment charges of $15.3 million related to the
write down of the carrying value of the net assets of the firebuilding and Teutonia

®

stroller businesses to their estimated fair market value. The Company sold the firebuilding business to
Royal Oak Enterprises, LLC (“Royal Oak”). Former company directors Martin E. Franklin and Ian G.H. Ashken are affiliates of Royal Oak and were company directors during 2017.

In March 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Tools business, including the Irwin

®

, Lenox

®

and Hilmor

®

brands. The selling price was $1.95 billion, subject to customary working capital adjustments. The net assets of the
Tools business were approximately $1.1 billion, including approximately $711 million of goodwill, resulting in a pretax gain of $768 million, which is included in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations
for 2017. For 2016 and 2015, the Tools business generated 5.5% and 12.9%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales. Net sales for the Tools business in 2017 were not material. The Tools business was reported in the Other segment up
until its date of disposition.



In June 2016, the Company sold its Décor business, including Levolor

®

and Kirsch

®

window coverings and drapery hardware, for consideration, net of fees, of approximately $224 million, resulting in a
pretax gain of $160 million, which is included in other (income) expense, net for 2016. For 2016 and 2015, the Décor business generated 1.1% and 5.1%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

For 2017, 2016 and 2015 reclassifications from AOCI to the results of operations for the Company’s pension
and postretirement benefit plans were a

pre-tax

expense of $14.6 million, $16.5 million and $74.1 million, respectively, and primarily represent the amortization of net actuarial losses and plan
settlements (see Footnote 13). These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of sales. For 2017, 2016 and 2015, reclassifications from AOCI to the results of operations for the Company’s derivative financial
instruments for effective cash flow hedges were

pre-tax

(loss) income of ($8.3) million, ($12.0) million and $14.3 million, respectively (see Footnote 11). The amounts reclassified to earnings from the
cumulative translation adjustment are due to divestitures (see Footnote 3).

Restructuring Costs

Restructuring provisions were
determined based on estimates prepared at the time the restructuring actions were approved by management and are periodically updated for changes. Restructuring amounts also include amounts recognized as incurred.

As part of the Jarden Acquisition, the Company initiated a comprehensive strategic assessment of the business and launched a new corporate strategy that
focuses the portfolio, prioritizes investment in the categories with the greatest potential for growth, and extends the Company’s advantaged capabilities in insights, product design, innovation, and

E-commerce

to the broadened portfolio. This new corporate strategy is called the Growth Game Plan and builds on the successful track record of growth acceleration, margin development, and value creation
associated with the transformation of Newell Rubbermaid from 2011 through 2016.

Project Renewal

In April 2015, the Company committed to a further expansion of Project Renewal (the “April 2015 Expansion”). Project Renewal was initially launched
in October 2011 to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in growth platforms within the business. Under Project Renewal, the Company has simplified and aligned its businesses around two key
activities—Brand & Category Development and Market Execution & Delivery. Pursuant to an expansion of Project Renewal in October 2014, the Company has: (i) further streamlined its supply chain function, including
reducing overhead and realigning the supply chain management structure; (ii) invested in value analysis and value engineering efforts to reduce product and packaging costs; (iii) reduced operational and manufacturing complexity in its
Learn segment; and (iv) further streamlined its distribution and transportation functions. Under the April 2015 Expansion, the Company has further implemented additional activities designed to further streamline business partnering functions
(e.g., Finance/IT, Legal and Human Resources), optimize global selling and trade marketing functions and rationalize the Company’s real estate portfolio. Project Renewal was completed by the end of 2017, and as a result, additional cash
payments and savings will be realized thereafter.

During 2015, the Company incurred $52.4 million of restructuring costs related to Project Renewal.

Jarden Integration

The Company currently expects to
incur up to approximately $1.0 billion of restructuring and other costs through 2021 to integrate the legacy Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden businesses (the “Jarden Integration”). Initially, integration projects will primarily be focused
on driving cost synergies in procurement, overhead functions and organizational changes designed to redefine the operating model of the Company from a holding company to an operating company. Restructuring costs associated with integration projects
are expected to include employee-related cash costs, including severance, retirement and other termination benefits, and contract termination and other costs. In addition, other costs associated with the Jarden Integration include advisory and
personnel costs for managing and implementing integration projects.

Other Restructuring

In addition to Project Renewal, the Company has incurred restructuring costs primarily relating to the Jarden Acquisition and the Elmer’s acquisition.

Senior Notes

In March 2017, the Company commenced cash
tender offers (the “Tender Offers”) totaling approximately $1.06 billion for any and all of its 6.25% senior notes due 2018 and up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of certain of its other senior notes. In March 2017, pursuant
to the Tender Offers the Company repurchased approximately $63 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25%



senior notes due 2018, approximately $733 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.6% senior notes due 2019 and approximately $76 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.0%
senior notes due 2020 for total consideration, excluding accrued interest, of approximately $897 million. As a result of these debt extinguishments, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $27.8 million during the
first quarter of 2017, primarily comprised of prepayment premiums and a

non-cash

charge due to the

write-off

of deferred debt issuance costs.

In April 2017, the Company redeemed the remaining approximately $187 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2018 for total
consideration, excluding accrued interest of approximately $195 million. As a result of this debt extinguishment, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $4.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017,
primarily comprised of prepayment premiums, partially offset by the

write-off

of a deferred gain on previously terminated interest rate swaps.

Generally, the senior notes are redeemable by the Company at a price equal to the greater of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes to be
redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, generally within three and six months to scheduled maturity, depending on the debt instrument, the
senior notes may be redeemed at a price equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper

The
Company maintains a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that matures in January 2022 (the “Facility”). Under the Facility, the Company may borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms. The Facility also provides for the
issuance of up to $100 million of letters of credit, so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Facility.

Receivables Facility

The Company maintains a
$950 million receivables purchase agreement that matures in October 2019 (the “Securitization Facility”) and bears interest at a margin over a variable interest rate. At December 31, 2017, the borrowing rate margin and the unused
line fee on the Securitization Facility were 0.80% and 0.40% per annum, respectively.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, unamortized deferred debt issue costs were $68.9 and $80.1. These costs are included in total debt and are being amortized
over the respective terms of the underlying debt.

Net Investment Hedge

The Company has designated the
€300.0 million principal balance of the 3.75% senior notes due October 2021 as a net investment hedge of the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in certain Euro-functional currency subsidiaries with Euro-denominated net assets.
At December 31, 2017, $19.7 million of deferred losses have been recorded in AOCI. See Footnote 11 for disclosures regarding the Company’s derivative financial instruments.



FOOTNOTE 11

Derivatives

From time to time, the Company enters into
derivative transactions to hedge its exposures to interest rate, foreign currency rate and commodity price fluctuations. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Contracts

The Company manages its
fixed and floating rate debt mix using interest rate swaps. The Company may use fixed and floating rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for
interest. Floating rate swaps would be used, depending on market conditions, to convert the fixed rates of long-term debt into short-term variable rates. Fixed rate swaps would be used to reduce the Company’s risk of the possibility of
increased interest costs. Interest rate swap contracts are therefore used by the Company to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision. Gains and losses recognized in income, as well as the cash paid and received from the
settlement of interest rate swaps is included in interest expense.

Fair Value Hedges

At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $527 million notional amount of interest rate swaps that exchange a fixed rate of interest for
variable rate (LIBOR) of interest plus a weighted average spread. These floating rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges against $277 million of principal on the 4.7% senior notes due 2020 and $250 million of principal on the 4.0%
senior notes due 2024 for the remaining life of these notes. The effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these swaps is offset by fair value adjustments in the underlying debt.

Cross-Currency Contracts

The Company uses
cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency risk on certain intercompany financing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, the notional value of outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps was approximately
$160 million. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are intended to eliminate uncertainty in cash flows in U.S. Dollars and British Pounds in connection with the intercompany financing arrangements. The effective portions of the changes in
fair values of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements are reported in AOCI and an amount is reclassified out of AOCI into other (income) expense, net, which is offset in the same period by the remeasurement in the carrying value of the
underlying foreign currency intercompany financing arrangements being hedged. Gains and losses recognized in income on these cross-currency swaps are included in other (income) expense, net.

Foreign Currency Contracts

The Company uses
forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales and have maturity dates through September 2018. The derivatives used to hedge these
forecasted transactions that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gains or losses on these derivatives is deferred as a component of AOCI and is recognized in earnings at the same
time that the hedged item affects earnings and is included in the same caption in the statements of operations as the underlying hedged item. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $260 million notional amount outstanding of
forward foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted inventory purchases and sales. Gains and losses recognized in income on these forward foreign currency contracts are included in sales and cost of sales.

The Company also uses foreign currency contracts, primarily forward foreign currency contracts, to mitigate the foreign currency exposure of certain other
foreign currency transactions. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion notional amount outstanding of these foreign currency contracts that are not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and have
maturity dates through November 2018. Fair market value gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are classified in other (income) expense, net.

FOOTNOTE 13

Employee
Benefit and Retirement Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries have noncontributory pension, profit sharing and contributory 401(k) plans covering
substantially all of their international and domestic employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and/or compensation. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute not less than the minimum amounts required by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or foreign statutes to ensure that plan assets will be adequate to provide retirement benefits.

The amount of AOCI expected to be recognized in pension and postretirement benefit expense for the year ending December 31, 2018 is $13.9 million
and is substantially comprised of net unrecognized actuarial losses.

Effective December 31, 2015, the Company changed the method used to estimate
the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. The new estimation approach discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using
the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligations. Historically, the estimated service and interest cost components utilized a single weighted-average discount rate
derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligations at the beginning of the period.

The Company elected this change to provide a more
precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is
inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly was accounted for prospectively.

The Company’s

tax-qualified

defined benefit pension plan is frozen for the entire U.S. workforce, and the Company has replaced the defined benefit pension plan with an additional defined contribution benefit arrangement,
which benefit vests after three years of employment. The Company recorded $15.6 million, $17.4 million and $16.5 million in expense for the defined contribution benefit arrangement for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Company has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), which is a nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plan pursuant to
which the Company will pay supplemental benefits to certain key employees upon retirement based upon the employees’ years of service and compensation. The SERP is primarily funded through a trust agreement with a trustee that owns life
insurance policies on both active and former key employees with aggregate net death benefits of $274 million. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the life insurance contracts were accounted for using the investment method and had a cash
surrender value of $123 million and $116 million, respectively, and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All premiums paid and proceeds received associated with the life insurance policies are included in
accrued liabilities and other in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The projected benefit obligation was $127 million and $123 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The SERP liabilities are included in the
pension table below; however, the value of the Company’s investments in the life insurance contracts, cash and mutual funds are excluded from the table, as they do not qualify as plan assets.

The Company’s matching contributions to the contributory 401(k) plans were $30.2 million, $25.5 million and $14.0 million for 2017, 2016
and 2015, respectively.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

There are no plan assets associated with the Company’s postretirement benefit plans.

The current healthcare cost trend rate gradually declines through 2037 to the ultimate trend rate and remains level thereafter. A one percentage point change
in assumed healthcare cost trend rate would not have a material effect on the postretirement benefit obligation or the service and interest cost components of postretirement benefit costs.

Plan Assets

The Company
employs a total return investment approach for its pension plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of pension plan assets. The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by
outperforming plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and the Company’s financial condition. The domestic investment portfolios contain a
diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. The domestic equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in U.S. large-capitalization stocks, U.S. small-capitalization stocks and
international securities. The domestic fixed income investments are primarily comprised of investment-grade and high-yield securities through investments in corporate and government bonds, government agencies and asset-backed securities. The
Level 1 investments are primarily based upon quoted market prices. The domestic Level 3 investments are primarily comprised of insurance contracts valued at contract value. The investments excluded from the fair value hierarchy are

NAV-based

hedge fund investments that generally have a redemption frequency of 90 days or less, with various redemption notice periods that are generally less than a month. The notice periods for certain investments
may vary based on the size of the redemption. The international Level 2 investments are primarily comprised of insurance contracts whose fair values are estimated based on the future cash flows to be received under the contracts discounted to
the present using a discount rate that approximates the discount rate used to measure the associated pension plan liabilities. The international Level 3 investments are primarily comprised of insurance contracts valued at contract value and
alternative investments. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.

The expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors, including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and
expected future market conditions, risk and active management premiums. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in expected returns on the Company’s defined benefit pension plan’s investments.
The target asset allocations for the Company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan, based in part due to plan demographics, funded



status and liability duration. In general, the Company’s target asset allocations are as follows: equities approximately 25% to 40%; fixed income investments approximately 20% to 40%; and
cash, alternative investments and other, approximately 25% to 45% as of December 31, 2017. Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of transactions. The
Company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans. The asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile.

For 2017, 2016 and 2015, the amount of potentially dilutive securities that are excluded because their effect would be anti-dilutive are not material.

As of December 31, 2017, there were 2.3 million potentially dilutive restricted share awards with performance-based vesting targets that were not
met and as such, have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.

For 2017, 2016 and 2015, dividends and equivalents for
share-based awards expected to be forfeited did not have a material impact on net income for basic and diluted earnings per share.

At December 31,
2017, there were approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock that had not been issued to the former holders of Jarden shares who are exercising their right to judicial appraisal under Delaware law. Absent consent by the
Company, these dissenting shareholders are no longer entitled to the merger consideration, but are instead entitled only to the judicially determined fair value of their shares, plus interest accruing from the date of the Jarden Acquisition, payable
in cash (see Footnote 19).

FOOTNOTE 15

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company maintains a 2013
stock plan (the “2013 Plan”), which allows for grants of stock-based awards. At December 31, 2017, there were approximately 37 million share-based awards collectively available for grant under the 2013 Plan. The 2013 Plan
generally provides for awards to vest over a minimum three-year period, although some awards entitle the recipient to shares of common stock if specified market or performance conditions are achieved and vest no earlier than one year from the date
of grant. The stock-based awards granted to employees include stock options and time-based and performance-based restricted stock units, as follows:



Stock Options

The Company has issued both nonqualified and incentive stock options at exercise prices equal to the Company’s common stock price on the date of grant
with contractual terms of ten years. Stock options issued by the Company generally vest and are expensed ratably over three years. Stock option grants are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting, except upon
retirement, in which case the options may remain outstanding and exercisable for the remaining contractual term of the option. The Company has not granted stock options since 2011.

Time-Based Restricted Stock Units

Awards of time-based
restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. The awards generally cliff-vest in three years or vest ratably over three years from the date of grant.
In the case of retirement (as defined in the award agreement), awards vest depending on the employee’s age and years of service.

The time-based
restricted stock units have rights to dividend equivalents payable in cash. Time-based restricted stock units issued in 2016 and prior receive dividend payments at the same time as the shareholders of the Company’s stock. Time-based restricted
stock units issued subsequent to 2016 have dividend equivalents credited to the recipient and are paid only to the extent the applicable service criteria is met and the time-based restricted stock units vest and the related stock is issued.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units

Performance-based restricted stock unit awards (“Performance-Based RSUs”) represent the right to receive unrestricted shares of stock based on the
achievement of Company performance objectives and/or individual performance goals established by the Organizational Development & Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.

The Performance-Based RSUs generally entitle recipients to shares of common stock if performance objectives are achieved, and typically vest no earlier than
one year from the date of grant and primarily, no later than three years from the date of grant. The actual number of shares that will ultimately vest is dependent on the level of achievement of the specified performance conditions. For restricted
stock units with performance conditions that are based on stock price (“Stock-Price Based RSUs”), the grant date fair value of certain Stock-Price based RSUs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation, with the primary input into such
valuation being the expected future volatility of the Company’s common stock, and if applicable, the volatilities of the common stocks of the companies in the Company’s peer group, upon which the relative total shareholder return
performance is measured. In the case of retirement (as defined in the award agreement), awards vest depending on the employee’s age and years of service, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable performance criteria.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation pursuant to relevant authoritative guidance, which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock
awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation, net of estimated forfeitures, over the longer of the derived service period or explicit requisite service period for awards expected to vest. For non stock-price based
Performance-Based RSUs, the Company assesses the probability of achievement of the performance conditions each period and records expense for the awards based on the probable achievement of such metrics.

With respect to Performance-Based RSUs, dividend equivalents are credited to the recipient and are paid only to the extent the applicable performance criteria
are met and the Performance-Based RSUs vest and the related stock is issued.

FOOTNOTE 16

Income
Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) was enacted. Effective January 1, 2018, the legislation
significantly changed U.S. tax law by lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, modifying the foreign earnings deferral provisions, and imposing a

one-time

toll charge on deemed repatriated
earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. Effective for 2018 and forward, there are additional changes including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global
intangible

low-taxed

income provisions (“GILTI”), the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”), and a deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”). As of December 31,
2017, two provisions affecting the financial statements are the corporate tax rate reduction and the

one-time

toll charge. As the corporate tax rate reduction was enacted in 2017 and effective January 1,
2018, the Company appropriately accounted for the tax rate change in the valuation of our deferred taxes. As a result, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $1.5 billion in the current year statement of operations for 2017.



The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides the Company with
up to one year to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. When the initial accounting for U.S Tax Reform impacts is incomplete, the Company may include provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or continue to apply
the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate cannot be made. The Company has estimated the provisional tax impacts related to the toll charge and as result, the Company recognized a net tax expense of approximately $195 million. Additionally, the
Company has estimated the provisional tax impacts related to our deferred income taxes, including the impacts of the change in Corporate tax rate, executive compensation, and our indefinite reinvestment assertion. The Company has elected to account
for the tax on GILTI as a period cost and therefore has not recorded deferred taxes related to GILTI on its foreign subsidiaries. The final impact may differ from these provisional amounts due to gathering additional information to more precisely
compute the amount of tax, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and changes in interpretations and assumptions. The Company expect to finalize accounting for the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform during 2018.

In connection with U.S. Tax Reform, the Company has reversed its previously recorded deferred tax liability related to historical Jarden earnings of
approximately $87 million as of December 31, 2017, as those earnings were subject to the toll charge on deemed repatriated earnings. In addition, the Company no longer considers a significant portion of the historic earnings of our foreign
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017, to be indefinitely reinvested. Under the provision of SAB 118, the Company has estimated the state income taxes and local country withholding taxes that would be owed when our historic earnings, for
which the Company is not permanently reinvested, are distributed. As a result, the Company has recorded deferred income taxes of approximately $12 million.

At December 31, 2017, the Company has approximately $1.5 billion of U.S., state, and foreign net operating losses
(“NOLs”), of which approximately $973 million do not expire and approximately $572 million expire between 2018 and 2037. Additionally, approximately $296 million U.S. federal NOLs are subject to varying limitations on their
use under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Of these U.S. federal NOLs, approximately $289 million are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements and approximately $31 million were utilized in
the current year. The foreign tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2020.

The Company routinely reviews valuation allowances recorded against
deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis as to whether the Company has the ability to realize the deferred tax assets. In making such a determination, the Company takes into consideration all available and appropriate positive and
negative evidence, including projected future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, the ability to carryback net operating losses, and available tax planning strategies. Although realization is not assured,
based on this existing evidence, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of existing deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowances.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company has a valuation allowance recorded against foreign NOLs and other deferred tax assets the Company believes are not
more likely than not to be realized due to the uncertainty resulting from a lack of previous taxable income within the applicable tax jurisdictions. A valuation allowance of $295 million and $325 million was recorded against certain
deferred tax asset balances as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net valuation allowance decrease of $30.5 million, comprised of a valuation allowance decrease of
$35.2 million relating to the Company’s German operations for which the Company concluded the deferred tax assets were realizable; and an increase in valuation allowance in the current year in certain jurisdictions that the Company
previously determined were not more likely than not to be realized. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded a net valuation allowance increase of $34.3 million, comprised of acquired valuation allowance from Jarden, a
valuation allowance decrease of $17.9 million related to the Company’s UK operations for which the Company concluded the deferred tax assets were realizable; currency translation in foreign jurisdictions due to the strengthening of the
U.S. dollar against the Euro, British Pound, and other currencies; and an increase in valuation allowance in the current year in certain jurisdictions that the Company previously determined were not more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recorded unrecognized tax benefit as a result of acquisitions of $216 million in 2016. If recognized,
$365 million and $360 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively, would affect the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax
benefits as a component of income tax expense. During 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized income tax expense on interest and penalties of $8.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively, due to the accrual of current year interest on
existing positions offset by the resolution of certain tax contingencies offset.

The Company anticipates approximately $51.5 million of unrecognized
tax benefits will reverse within the next 12 months. It is reasonably possible due to activities of various worldwide taxing authorities, including proposed assessments of additional tax and possible settlement of audit issues that additional
changes to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits could occur. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to audits by worldwide taxing authorities regarding various tax liabilities. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax
returns for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 as well as certain state and

non-US

income tax returns for various years, are under routine examination.

The Company files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The
statute of limitations for the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns has expired for years prior to 2011. The Company’s Canadian tax returns are subject to examination for years after 2010. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer
subject to other income tax examinations for years before 2013.

FOOTNOTE 17

Fair Value

GAAP defines fair value as the price that
would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to
replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). These valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect
the Company’s market assumptions. As the basis for evaluating such inputs, a three-tier value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements

The Company’s
financial assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments included in cash and cash equivalents, its mutual fund investments included in other assets, and its derivative instruments, which are
primarily included in prepaid expenses and other, other non-current assets, other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.

For publicly-traded mutual funds, fair value is determined on the basis of quoted market prices and, accordingly, such
investments have been classified as Level 1. Other investment securities are primarily comprised of money market accounts that are classified as Level 2. The Company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments using standard
pricing models and market-based assumptions for all significant inputs, such as yield curves and quoted spot and forward exchange rates. Accordingly, the Company’s derivative instruments are classified as Level 2.

The Company adjusts its pension asset values to fair value on an annual basis (see Footnote 13).

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

The Company’s
nonfinancial assets which are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and certain other assets.

The Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are fair valued using discounted cash flows and market multiple methods. Goodwill impairment
testing requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, including the identification of reporting units; the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; and the estimation of future cash flows, business growth rates, terminal
values and discount rates. The testing of indefinite-lived intangibles under established guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, such as the estimation of cash flow projections, terminal values and
discount rates.

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not
be recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows. If the Company concludes that impairment exists, the carrying amount is reduced to fair value.

The
carrying value and estimated fair value measurement of assets held for sale are classified as Level 3, as the fair values utilize significant unobservable inputs.

Operating income (loss) by segment is net sales less cost of products sold and selling, general & administrative expenses (“SG&A”). Operating income by geographic area is net sales less cost of
products sold, SG&A, impairment charges and restructuring costs. Certain headquarters expenses of an operational nature are allocated to business segments and geographic areas primarily on a net sales basis. Depreciation and amortization related
to shared assets is allocated to the segments on a percentage of sales basis, and the allocated depreciation and amortization is included in segment operating income.

FOOTNOTE 19

Litigation and Contingencies

The Company is involved in
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. These proceedings include claims for damages arising out of use of the Company’s products, allegations of infringement of intellectual property, commercial disputes and employment
matters, as well as environmental matters. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages, and certain proceedings may purport to be class actions.

Recall of Harness Buckles on Select Car Seats

In
February 2014, Graco, a subsidiary of the Company, announced a voluntary recall in the U.S. of harness buckles used on approximately 4 million toddler car seats manufactured between 2006 and 2013. In July 2014, Graco announced that it had
agreed to expand the recall to include certain infant car seats manufactured between July 2010 and May 2013. In December 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the “NHTSA”) announced an investigation into the timeliness
of the recall, and in March 2015, the investigation concluded with Graco entering into a consent order with NHTSA pursuant to which Graco committed to spend $7.0 million in total over a five-year period to enhance child passenger safety and
make a $3.0 million payment to NHTSA. At December 31, 2017, the amount remaining to be paid associated with the consent order was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements of the Company.



Jarden Acquisition

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), any Jarden stockholder who did not vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, and
otherwise complies with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, is entitled to seek an appraisal of his or her shares of Jarden common stock by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. As
of December 31, 2017, dissenting stockholders collectively holding approximately 2.9 million shares of Jarden common stock have delivered (and not withdrawn) to Jarden written demands for appraisal. Two separate appraisal petitions, styled
as

Dunham Monthly Distribution Fund v. Jarden Corporation

, Case No.

12454-VCS

(Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware) and

Merion Capital LP v. Jarden Corporation

, Case No.

12456-VCS

(Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware), respectively, were filed on June 14, 2016 by a total of ten purported Jarden stockholders seeking an appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Jarden
common stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. A third appraisal petition (

Fir Tree Value Master Fund, LP v. Jarden Corporation

, Case No.

12546-VCS

(Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware))
was filed on July 8, 2016 by two purported Jarden stockholders seeking an appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Jarden common stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. A fourth appraisal petition (

Veritian Partners Master Fund
LTP v. Jarden Corporation

, Case No.

12650-VCS

(Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware)) was filed on August 12, 2016 by two purported Jarden stockholders seeking an appraisal of the fair value of
their shares of Jarden common stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. On or about October 3, 2016, the foregoing petitions were consolidated for joint prosecution under Case No.

12456-VCS,

and
except as provided below, the litigation is ongoing. The holders of a total of approximately 10.6 million former Jarden shares were represented in these actions initially.

On July 5, 2017 and July 6, 2017, Jarden and eleven of the dissenting stockholders, specifically including Merion Capital ERISA LP, Merion Capital
LP, Merion Capital II LP, Dunham Monthly Distribution Fund, WCM Alternatives: Event-Driven Fund, Westchester Merger Arbitrage Strategy sleeve of the JNL Multi-Manager Alternative Fund, JNL/Westchester Capital Event Driven Fund, WCM Master Trust, The
Merger Fund, The Merger Fund VL and SCA JP Morgan Westchester (collectively, the “Settling Petitioners”), entered into settlement agreements with respect to approximately 7.7 million former Jarden shares (collectively, the
“Settlement Agreements”). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreements in exchange for withdrawing their respective demands for appraisal of their shares of Jarden common stock and a full and final release of all claims, among other things, the
Settling Petitioners received the original merger consideration provided for under the Merger Agreement, specifically (1) 0.862 of a share of Newell common stock, and (2) $21.00 in cash, per share of Jarden common stock (collectively, the
“Merger Consideration”), excluding any and all other benefits, including, without limitation, the right to accrued interest, dividends, and/or distributions. Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreements, Newell issued
6.6 million shares of Newell common stock to the Settling Petitioners (representing the stock component of the Merger Consideration), and authorized payment to the Settling Petitioners of approximately $162 million (representing the cash
component of the Merger Consideration). The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware has dismissed with prejudice the appraisal claims for the Settling Petitioners. Following the settlements, claims from the holders of approximately
2.9 million former Jarden shares remain outstanding in the proceedings. The value of the merger consideration attributable to such shares based on the Company’s stock price on the closing date of the Jarden acquisition would have been
approximately $171 million in the aggregate. The fair value of the shares of Jarden common stock held by these dissenting stockholders, as determined by the court, would be payable in cash and could be lower or higher than the merger consideration
to which such Jarden stockholders would have been entitled under the Merger Agreement.

Environmental Matters

The Company is involved in various matters concerning federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including matters in which the Company has been
identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“U.S. EPA”) and certain state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) at contaminated sites under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (the “CERCLA”) and equivalent state laws. In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has considered several factors, including the extent of the Company’s volumetric contribution at each
site relative to that of other PRPs; the kind of waste; the terms of existing cost sharing and other applicable agreements; the financial ability of other PRPs to share in the payment of requisite costs; the Company’s prior experience with
similar sites; environmental studies and cost estimates available to the Company; the effects of inflation on cost estimates; and the extent to which the Company’s, and other parties’, status as PRPs is disputed.

The Company’s estimate of environmental remediation costs associated with these matters as of December 31, 2017 was $48.3 million, which is
included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. No insurance recovery was taken into account in determining the Company’s cost estimates or reserves, nor do the Company’s cost
estimates or reserves reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to certain long-term operations and maintenance CERCLA matters.

Lower Passaic River Matter

U.S. EPA has issued General
Notice Letters (“GNLs”) to over 100 entities, including the Company and Berol Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company (“Berol”), alleging that they are PRPs at the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, which includes a

17-mile

stretch of the Lower Passaic River and its tributaries.

Seventy-two

of the GNL recipients, including the Company on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, Goody
Products, Inc. and Berol (the “Company Parties”), have taken over the performance of the remedial



investigation (“RI”) and feasibility study (“FS”) for the Lower Passaic River. On April 11, 2014, while work on the RI/FS remained underway, U.S. EPA issued a Source
Control Early Action Focused Feasibility Study (“FFS”), which proposed four alternatives for remediation of the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River. U.S. EPA’s cost estimates for its cleanup alternatives ranged from
approximately $315 million to approximately $3.2 billion in capital costs plus from $0.5 million to $1.8 million in annual maintenance costs for 30 years, with its preferred alternative carrying an estimated cost of approximately
$1.7 billion plus an additional $1.6 million in annual maintenance costs for 30 years. In February 2015, the participating parties submitted to the U.S. EPA a draft RI, followed by submission of a draft FS in April 2015. The draft FS sets
forth various alternatives for remediating the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River, ranging from a “no action” alternative, to targeted remediation of locations along the entire lower 17 mile stretch of the river, to remedial actions
consistent with U.S. EPA’s preferred alternative as set forth in the FFS for the lower 8.3 miles coupled with monitored natural recovery and targeted remediation in the upper 9 miles. The cost estimates for these alternatives range from
approximately $28.0 million to $2.7 billion, including related operation, maintenance and monitoring costs. The participating parties have been discussing the draft RI and FS reports with U.S. EPA and are preparing revised reports.

U.S. EPA issued its final Record of Decision for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River (the “ROD”) in March 2016, which, in the language of
the document, finalizes as the selected remedy the preferred alternative set forth in the FFS, which U.S. EPA estimates will cost $1.4 billion. Subsequent to the release of the ROD in March 2016, U.S. EPA issued GNLs for the lower 8.3 miles of
the Lower Passaic River (the “2016 GNL”) to numerous entities, apparently including all previous recipients of the initial GNL as well as several additional entities. As with the initial GNL, the Company and Berol were among the recipients
of the 2016 GNL. The 2016 GNL states that U.S. EPA would like to determine whether one entity, Occidental Chemical Corporation (“OCC”), will voluntarily perform the remedial design for the selected remedy for the lower 8.3 miles, and that
following execution of an agreement for the remedial design, U.S. EPA plans to begin negotiation of a remedial action consent decree “under which OCC and the other major PRPs will implement and/or pay for U.S. EPA’s selected remedy for the
lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River and reimburse U.S. EPA’s costs incurred for the Lower Passaic River.” The letter “encourage[s] the major PRPs to meet and discuss a workable approach to sharing responsibility for
implementation and funding of the remedy” without indicating who may be the “major PRPs.” Finally, U.S. EPA states that it “believes that some of the parties that have been identified as PRPs under CERCLA, and some parties not
yet named as PRPs, may be eligible for a cash out settlement with U.S. EPA for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River.”

In September 2016,
OCC and EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent for performance of the remedial design. On March 30, 2017, U.S. EPA sent a letter offering a cash settlement in the amount of $280,600 to twenty PRPs, not including the Company
Parties, for CERCLA Liability (with reservations, such as for Natural Resource Damages) in the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River. U.S. EPA further indicated in related correspondence that a cash out settlement might be appropriate for
additional parties that are “not associated with the release of dioxins, furans, or PCBs to the Lower Passaic River.” Then, by letter dated September 18, 2017, U.S. EPA announced an allocation process involving all GNL recipients
except those participating in the first-round

cash-out

settlement, and five public entities. The letter affirms that U.S. EPA anticipates eventually offering

cash-out

settlements to a number of parties, and that it expects “that the private PRPs responsible for release of dioxin, furans, and/or PCBs will perform the OU2 [lower 8.3 mile] remedial action.” At this time, it is unclear how the cost of any
cleanup would be allocated among any of the parties, including the Company Parties or any other entities. The site is also subject to a Natural Resource Damage Assessment.

OCC has asserted that it is entitled to indemnification by Maxus Energy Corporation (“Maxus”) for its liability in connection with the Diamond
Alkali Superfund Site. OCC has also asserted that Maxus’s parent company, YPF, S.A., and certain other affiliates (the “YPF Entities”) similarly must indemnify OCC, including on an “alter ego” theory. On June 17,
2016, Maxus and certain of its affiliates commenced a chapter 11 bankruptcy case in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In connection with that proceeding, the YPF Entities are attempting to resolve any liability they may
have to Maxus and the other Maxus entities undergoing the chapter 11 bankruptcy. An amended Chapter 11 plan of liquidation became effective in July 2017. In conjunction with that plan, Maxus and certain other parties, including the Company parties,
entered into a mutual contribution release agreement pertaining to certain costs, but not costs associated with ultimate remedy.

Given the uncertainties
pertaining to this matter, including that U.S. EPA is still reviewing the draft RI and FS, that no framework for or agreement on allocation for the investigation and ultimate remediation has been developed, and that there exists the potential for
further litigation regarding costs and cost sharing, the extent to which the Company Parties may be held liable or responsible is not yet known.

Based on
currently known facts and circumstances, the Company does not believe that this matter is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, including, among other factors, because the Company Parties’
facilities are not even alleged to have discharged the contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments, and because there are



numerous other parties who will likely share in any costs of remediation and/or damages. However, in the event of one or more adverse determinations related to this matter, it is possible that
the ultimate liability resulting from this matter and the impact on the Company’s results of operations could be material.

Because of the
uncertainties associated with environmental investigations and response activities, the possibility that the Company could be identified as a PRP at sites identified in the future that require the incurrence of environmental response costs and the
possibility that sites acquired in business combinations may require environmental response costs, actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from the Company’s estimates.

Clean Air Act Labeling Matter

In April 2015, the Company
became aware that two beverage container products, one product of its recently acquired bubba brands business and one product of its recently acquired Ignite business, contained closed cell rigid polyurethane foam insulation that was blown with
HCFC-141b, which is listed as a Class II

ozone-depleting

substance under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Under the Clean Air Act and U.S. EPA’s regulations
promulgated thereunder, as of January 1, 2015, certain products made with or containing ozone depleting substances, including HCFC-141b, must bear a specific warning label. The Company discovered that the affected products imported in
early 2015 did not display the required label. While the affected product lines were not compliant with applicable environmental regulations regarding ozone depleting substances, use of the products is safe and poses no risk to consumers. Upon
discovery, the Company self-reported the violations to the U.S. EPA and replaced the blowing agent in the products. In September 2017, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement and Final Order with the U.S. EPA pursuant to which the Company has
paid a penalty of $106,000.

Other Matters

Although
management of the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings with certainty, it believes that the ultimate resolution of the Company’s proceedings, including any amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts
reserved, will not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, except as otherwise described above.

In the normal
course of business and as part of its acquisition and divestiture strategy, the Company may provide certain representations and indemnifications related to legal, environmental, product liability, tax or other types of issues. Based on the nature of
these representations and indemnifications, it is not possible to predict the maximum potential payments under all of these agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in
each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements did not have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $72.2 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Company’s
self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product liability and medical expenses.
