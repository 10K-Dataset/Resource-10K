   ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
             --------

   "Newell" or the "Company" refers to Newell Rubbermaid Inc. alone or
   with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as the context requires.

   GENERAL
   -------

   The Company is a global manufacturer and full-service marketer of
   name-brand consumer products serving the needs of volume purchasers,
   including discount stores and warehouse clubs, home centers and
   hardware stores, and office superstores and contract stationers.  The
   Company's basic business strategy is to merchandise a multi-product
   offering of everyday consumer products, backed by an obsession with
   customer service excellence and new product development, in order to
   achieve maximum results for its stockholders.  The Company's multi-
   product offering consists of name-brand consumer products in five
   business segments: Rubbermaid; Parker/Eldon; Levolor/Hardware;
   Calphalon/WearEver and Little Tikes/Graco.  The Company's financial
   objectives are to achieve above-average sales and earnings per share
   growth, maintain a superior return on investment and maintain a
   conservative level of debt.  To accomplish these objectives, the
   Company established five key measures to measure financial
   performance: internal sales growth, operating income as a percent of
   sales, working capital as a percent of sales, free cash flow and
   return on invested capital.  The Company defines free cash flow as cash
   provided from operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends.

   In an effort to achieve superior performance in the five key financial
   measures, the Company introduced six transformational strategic
   initiatives in 2001 as follows: Productivity, New Product Development,
   Marketing, Key Accounts, Streamlining, and Collaboration.

   Productivity is the initiative to reduce the cost of manufacturing a
   product by at least five percent per year, annually.  New Product
   Development represents the commitment to develop and introduce
   cutting-edge, innovative new products to the market.  The marketing
   initiative represents the Company's commitment to transform from a
   push to pull marketing organization, focusing on the end-user.  The
   Key Account initiative represents the Company's intention to allocate
   resources to those strategic retailers the Company believes will
   continue to grow in the near future.  Streamlining is the commitment
   to reduce non-value added costs and cut out excess layers, in an
   effort to be the low-cost supplier.  Collaboration is the Company's
   initiative for the divisional operating units to work together and
   maximize economies of scale and the use of best-practices.

   Forward-looking statements in this Report are made in reliance upon
   the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
   Act of 1995.  Such forward-looking statements may relate to, but are
   not limited to, information or assumptions about sales, income,

   forward-looking statements.  The Company cautions that forward-looking
   statements are not guarantees since there are inherent difficulties in
   predicting future results.  Actual results could differ materially from
   those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  Factors

   sales.



   Certain 2000 and 1999 amounts have been reclassified to conform with
   the 2001 presentation.









   Growth Strategy
   ---------------

   The Company's growth strategy emphasizes internal growth and
   acquisitions.  The Company has grown internally principally by
   introducing new products, entering new domestic and international
   markets, adding new customers, cross-selling existing product lines to
   current customers and supporting its U.S.-based customers'
   international expansion.  The Company has supplemented internal
   growth, both domestically and internationally, by acquiring businesses
   with brand name product lines and improving the profitability of such
   businesses through an integration process referred to as
   "Newellization."  Since 1990, the Company has completed more than 20
   major acquisitions (excluding Rubbermaid) representing more than $3
   billion in additional sales.

   Internal Growth
   ---------------

   An important element of the Company's growth strategy is internal
   growth.  Internal growth is accomplished through introducing new
   products, entering new domestic and international markets, adding new
   customers, cross-selling existing product lines to current customers
   and supporting its U.S.-based customers' international expansion.
   Internal growth is defined by the Company as growth from its "core
   businesses," which include continuing businesses owned more than one
   year and minor acquisitions.  The Company's goal is to achieve above-
   average internal growth, and is committed to achieving 5% internal
   growth by the end of 2004.


























   ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATION
   ----------------------------

   Acquisition Strategy
   --------------------

   The Company supplements internal growth by acquiring businesses and
   product lines with a strategic fit with the Company's existing
   businesses.  It also seeks to acquire product lines with a number one
   or two position in the markets in which they compete, a low technology
   level, a long product life cycle and the potential to reach the
   Company's standard of profitability.  In addition to adding entirely
   new product lines, the Company uses acquisitions to round out existing
   businesses and fill gaps in its product offering, add new customers
   and distribution channels, expand shelf space for the Company's
   products with existing customers, and improve operational efficiency
   through shared resources.  The Company intends to continue to pursue
   acquisition opportunities to complement internal growth.

   Newellization
   -------------

   "Newellization" is the Company's well-established profit improvement
   and productivity enhancement process that is applied to integrate
   newly acquired product lines.  The Newellization process includes
   establishing a more focused business strategy, improving customer
   service, reducing corporate overhead through centralization of
   administrative functions and tightening financial controls.  In
   integrating acquired businesses, the Company typically centralizes
   accounting systems, capital expenditure approval, cash management,
   order processing, billing, credit, accounts receivable and data
   processing operations.  To enhance efficiency, Newellization also
   focuses on improving manufacturing processes, eliminating
   non-productive lines, reducing inventories, increasing accounts
   receivable turnover, extending accounts payable terms and trimming
   excess costs.  The Newellization process usually takes approximately
   two to three years to complete.

   Selective Globalization
   -----------------------

   The Company is pursuing selective international opportunities to
   further its internal growth and acquisition objectives.  The rapid
   growth of consumer goods economies and retail structures in several
   regions outside the U.S., particularly Europe, Mexico and South
   America, makes them attractive to the Company by providing selective
   opportunities to acquire businesses, develop partnerships with new
   foreign customers and extend relationships with the Company's domestic
   customers whose businesses are growing internationally.  The Company's
   recent acquisitions, combined with existing sales to foreign
   customers, increased its sales outside the U.S. to approximately 27%
   of total sales in 2001 from 25% in 2000 and 23% in 1999.



   Additional information regarding acquisitions of businesses is
   included in Item 6 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial
   statements.

   STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
   ---------------------

   Productivity
   ------------

   The Company's objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing a
   product by at least five percent per year on an ongoing basis in order
   to become the low-cost supplier to our customers.  To achieve
   productivity, the Company will focus on reducing purchasing costs,
   materials handling costs, manufacturing inefficiencies, and excess
   overhead costs to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing products.

   New Product Development
   -----------------------

   The Company is determined to become the leader in introducing cutting-
   edge, innovative, and patented new products to the marketplace.  The
   Company seeks to employ the best and brightest new product engineers
   in order to achieve this goal through the implementation and execution
   of a world-class product development process.  The Company's intention
   is to become a "new product machine" that will enhance the brand image
   and help secure additional store listings.

   Marketing
   ---------

   The Company's objective is to develop long-term, mutually beneficial
   partnerships with its customers and become their supplier of choice.
   To achieve this goal, the Company has a value-added marketing program
   that offers a family of leading brand name staple products, tailored
   sales programs, innovative merchandising support, in-store services
   and responsive top management.

   The Company's marketing skills help customers stimulate store traffic
   and sales through timely advertising and innovative promotions.  The
   Company also assists customers in differentiating their offerings by
   customizing products and packaging.  Through self-selling packaging
   and displays that emphasize good-better-best value relationships,
   retail customers are encouraged to trade up to higher-value, best
   quality products.

   The Company is also committed to selective media advertising,
   including national television advertising, where appropriate in order
   to increase brand awareness among end-users of the product.

   Customer service also involves customer contact with top-level
   decision makers at the Company's divisions.  As part of its



   decentralized structure, the Company's division presidents are the
   chief marketing officers of their product lines and communicate
   directly with customers.  This structure permits early recognition of
   market trends and timely response to customer problems.

   Multi-Product Offering
   ----------------------

   The Company's increasingly broad product coverage in multiple product
   lines permits it to more effectively meet the needs of its customers.
   With families of leading, brand name products and profitable new
   products, the Company also can help volume purchasers sell a more
   profitable product mix.  As a potential single source for an entire
   product line, the Company can use program merchandising to improve
   product presentation, optimize display space for both sales and income
   and encourage impulse buying by retail customers.

   Customer Service
   ----------------

   The Company believes that one of the primary ways it distinguishes
   itself from its competitors is through customer service. The Company's
   ability to provide superior customer service is a result of its
   information technology, marketing and merchandising programs designed
   to enhance the sales and profitability of its customers and consistent
   on-time delivery of its products

   Key Accounts
   ------------

   In 2001, the Company introduced the Key Account Program, establishing
   sales organizations specifically to handle Wal*Mart, The Home Depot
   and Lowe's.  As part of this program, the company established
   President level positions to more effectively manage the relationships
   with these accounts.  The program allows the Company to present these
   customers with "one face" to enhance the Company's response time and
   understanding of the customer's needs, ensuring the best possible
   relationship.

   Phoenix Program
   ---------------

   In 2001, the Company introduced its Phoenix program.  This initiative
   is an action-oriented field sales force consisting of approximately
   500 recent university graduates.  The team works in the field,
   primarily within our Key Account structure performing product
   demonstrations, merchandising product, interacting with the end-user,
   and maintaining an ongoing relationship with store personnel.  This
   initiative allows the Company to ensure product placement and minimize
   stock outages.  As a result of this program, the company will leverage
   their relationship with these Key Accounts to maximize shelf space
   potential.



   Streamlining
   ------------

   The streamlining initiative represents the Company's commitment and
   focus on reducing nonvalue-added activities and excess layers within
   the organization.  The Company's goal is to use the savings generated
   from streamlining to fund marketing and other key initiatives, without
   increasing total expenses.  The Company is vigilant in creating a
   leaner organization that is more flexible in its response time, both
   internally and externally.

   Collaboration
   -------------

   Collaboration represents the Company's focus to benefit from the
   sharing of best-practices and the reduction of costs achieved through
   economies of scale.  For example, functions, such as purchasing and
   distribution and transportation, have been centralized to increase
   buying power across the Company.

   Additionally, certain administrative functions are centralized at the
   corporate level including cash management, accounting systems, capital
   expenditure approvals, order processing, billing, credit, accounts
   receivable, data processing operations and legal functions.
   Centralization concentrates technical expertise in one location,
   making it easier to observe overall business trends and manage the
   Company's businesses.




























   OTHER INFORMATION
   -----------------

   On-Time Delivery
   ----------------

   A critical element of the Company's customer service is consistent on-
   time delivery of products to its customers.  Retailers are pursuing a
   number of strategies to deliver the highest-quality, lowest-cost
   products to their customers.  A growing trend among retailers is to
   purchase on a "just-in-time" basis in order to reduce inventory costs
   and increase returns on investment.  As retailers shorten their lead
   times for orders, manufacturers need to more closely anticipate
   consumer buying patterns.  The Company supports its retail customers'
   "just-in-time" inventory strategies through investments in improved
   forecasting systems, more responsive manufacturing and distribution
   capabilities and electronic communications.  The Company manufactures
   the vast majority of its products and has extensive experience in
   high-volume, cost-effective manufacturing.  The high-volume nature of
   its manufacturing processes and the relatively consistent demand for
   its products enables the Company to ship most products directly from
   its factories without the need for independent warehousing and
   distribution centers.  For 2001, approximately 98% of the items
   ordered by customers were shipped on time, typically within two to
   three days of the customer's order.

   Foreign Operations
   ------------------

   Information regarding the Company's 2001, 2000 and 1999 foreign
   operations is included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial
   statements and is incorporated by reference herein.

   Raw Materials
   -------------

   The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for
   substantially all of its material requirements.  The raw materials and
   various purchased components required for its products have generally
   been available in sufficient quantities.

   Backlog
   -------

   The dollar value of unshipped factory orders is not material.

   Seasonal Variations
   -------------------

   The Company's product groups are only moderately affected by seasonal
   trends.  The Rubbermaid, Little Tikes/Graco and Calphalon/WearEver
   business segments typically have higher sales in the second half of



   the year due to retail stocking related to the holiday season; the
   Levolor/Hardware business segment has higher sales in the second and
   third quarters due to an increased level of do-it-yourself projects
   completed in the summer months; and the Parker/Eldon business segment
   has higher sales in the second and third quarters due to the back-to-
   school season.  Because these seasonal trends are moderate, the
   Company's consolidated quarterly sales do not fluctuate significantly,
   unless a significant acquisition is made.

   Patents and Trademarks
   ----------------------

   The Company has many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names,
   none of which is considered material to the consolidated operations.

   Competition
   -----------

   The Company competes with numerous other manufacturers and
   distributors of consumer products, many of which are large and well-
   established.  The Company's principal customers are large mass
   merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs
   and office superstores.  The rapid growth of these large mass
   merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns,
   have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer
   products retail industry and the formation of dominant multi-category
   retailers, many of which have strong bargaining power with suppliers.
   This environment significantly limits the Company's ability to recover
   cost increases through selling prices.  Other trends among retailers
   are to foster high levels of competition among suppliers, to demand
   that manufacturers supply innovative new products and to require
   suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products
   with shorter lead times.  Another trend, in the absence of a strong
   new product development effort or strong end-user brands, is for the
   retailer to import generic products directly from foreign sources.
   The combination of these market influences has created an intensely
   competitive environment in which the Company's principal customers
   continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in
   pricing pressures and the need for strong end-user brands, the ongoing
   introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in
   customer service.

   For more than 30 years, the Company has positioned itself to respond
   to the challenges of this retail environment by developing strong
   relationships with large, high-volume purchasers.  The Company markets
   its strong multi-product offering through virtually every category of
   high-volume retailer, including discount, drug, grocery and variety
   chains, warehouse clubs, department, hardware and specialty stores,
   home centers, office superstores, contract stationers and military
   exchanges.  The Company's largest customer, Wal-Mart (including Sam's
   Club), accounted for approximately 16% of net sales in 2001.  Other




   top ten customers included The Home Depot, Lowe's, Toys 'R Us, Target,
   Kmart, The Office Depot, JC Penney, United Stationers, and Staples.

   The Company's other principal methods of meeting its competitive
   challenges are high brand name recognition, superior customer service
   (including industry leading information technology, innovative "good-
   better-best" marketing and merchandising programs), consistent on-time
   delivery, decentralized manufacturing and marketing, centralized
   administration, and experienced management.

   2001 VERSUS 2000

   Net sales for 2001 were $6,909.3 million, representing a decrease of
   $25.4 million, or 0.4%, from $6,934.7 million in 2000. The sales
   decline was primarily due to shelf space losses at key customers and a
   significant downturn in the US economy partially offset by
   $498.5 million of sales contributions from Paper Mate/Parker (acquired
   December 2000).  Net sales for each of the Company's segments (and the
   primary reasons for the year-to-year changes) were as follows:

   Primary reasons for changes:
   (1)  Internal sales decline primarily due to shelf space losses at key
        customers and a significant downturn in the US economy.*
   (2)  $498.5 million of sales contribution from the Paper Mate/Parker
        acquisition+ (December 2000) offset by internal sales decline of
        8.8% primarily due to softness in the commercial channel and a
        significant downturn in the US economy.

   *    Internal sales growth/decline is defined by the Company as
        growth/decline from its core businesses, which include continuing
        businesses owned more than one year and minor acquisitions.

   +    Acquisitions and divestitures are described in Footnote 2 to the
        Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Gross income as a percentage of net sales in 2001 was 27.0%, or
   $1,862.7 million, versus 26.3%, or $1,826.0 million, in 2000.
   Excluding restructuring related and other charges relating to
   integration costs of recent acquisitions of $7.4 million ($4.7 million
   after taxes) and $7.9 million ($4.9 million after taxes) in 2001 and
   2000, respectively, gross income as a percent of net sales was 27.1%,
   or $1,870.1 million in 2001 versus 26.4%, or $1,833.9 million in 2000.
   This improvement in gross income is primarily due to the
   implementation of a productivity initiative throughout the Company and
   contributions from the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition.  The Company's
   productivity objective is to reduce the cost of manufacturing a
   product by at least five percent per year on an ongoing basis in order
   to become the low-cost supplier to our customers.  To achieve
   productivity improvements, the Company will focus on reducing
   purchasing costs, materials handling costs, manufacturing
   inefficiencies, and excess overhead costs to reduce the overall cost
   of manufacturing products.  The Company's productivity in 2001 was
   affected primarily by the increased costs associated with slowed
   manufacturing in an effort to reduce inventory levels (net inventories
   decreased $148.8 million during 2001) offset by improved raw material
   costs.

   Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in 2001 were
   16.9% of net sales, or $1,168.2 million, versus 13.0%, or $899.4





   million, in 2000.  Excluding charges relating to integration costs of
   recent acquisitions of $12.0 million ($7.7 million after taxes) and
   $8.8 million ($5.4 million after taxes) in 2001 and 2000,
   respectively, SG&A as a percent of net sales was 16.7% or $1,156.2
   million in 2001 compared to 12.8% or $890.6 million in 2000.  The
   increase in SG&A is a result of the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition and
   planned investments in marketing initiatives, including the Company's
   Key Account and Phoenix Programs, supporting the Company's brand
   portfolio and key account strategy.

   In 2001, the Company introduced the Key Account Program, establishing
   sales organizations specifically for Wal*Mart, The Home Depot and
   Lowe's.  As part of this program, the company established President-
   level positions to more effectively manage the relationships with
   these accounts.  The program allows the Company to present these
   customers with "one face" to enhance the Company's response time and
   understanding of the customer's needs, to support the best possible
   relationship.

   In 2001, the Company also introduced its Phoenix Program.  This
   initiative is an action-oriented field sales force consisting of
   approximately 500 recent university graduates.  The team works in the
   field, primarily within our Key Account structure, performing product
   demonstrations, merchandising product, interacting with the end-user,
   and maintaining an ongoing relationship with store personnel.  This
   initiative allows the Company to enhance product placement and
   minimize stock outages and, together with the Key Account Program, to
   maximize shelf space potential.  This program, implemented July 2001,
   gained traction throughout the year.  Impact from this initiative is
   expected to translate to the Consolidated Financial Statements through
   the impact of shelf space gains going forward.

   During 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   associated with the Company's strategic restructuring plan.  The
   restructuring plan is intended to streamline the Company's supply
   chain to ensure its position as the low cost global provider
   throughout the Company's product portfolio.  The plan consists of
   reducing worldwide headcount over the three years beginning in 2001,
   and includes consolidating duplicate manufacturing facilities.  As
   part of this plan, the Company incurred employee severance and
   termination benefit costs for approximately 1,700 employees.
   Additionally, the Company incurred facility exit costs related
   primarily to the closure of 14 facilities (four at Rubbermaid, one at
   Parker/Eldon, six at Levolor/Hardware and three at
   Calphalon/WearEver).  See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial
   Statements for a review of the charges.

   During 2000, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   related primarily to the continued Rubbermaid integration and plant
   closures in the Home Decor segment.  The Company incurred employee
   severance and termination benefit costs related to approximately 700
   employees terminated in 2000.  Such costs included severance and



   government mandated settlements for facility closures at Rubbermaid
   Europe, change in control payments made to former Rubbermaid
   executives, employee terminations at the domestic Rubbermaid divisions
   and severance at the Home Decor segment.  The Company incurred merger
   transaction costs related primarily to legal settlements for
   Rubbermaid's 1998 sale of a former division and other merger related
   contingencies resolved in 2000.  Additionally, the Company incurred
   facility and other exit costs related primarily to the closure of five
   European Rubbermaid facilities, three window furnishings facilities as
   well as the exit of various Rubbermaid product lines. See Footnote 3
   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of the charges.

   For the year ended December 31, 2001 goodwill amortization and other
   as a percentage of net sales were 0.8%, or $57.0 million, versus 0.7%,
   or $51.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2000.  The increase
   in goodwill amortization is a result of additional goodwill associated
   with the Paper Mate/Parker acquisition in December 2000.

   Operating income in 2001 was 8.3% of net sales, or $570.9 million,
   versus 12.0% of net sales, or $831.7 million, in 2000. Excluding
   restructuring and other charges of $86.1 million ($54.8 million after
   taxes) in 2001 and $59.7 million ($36.7 million after taxes) in 2000,
   operating income was $657.0, or 9.5%, of net sales in 2001 versus
   $891.4 million, or 12.9%, of net sales in 2000.  The decrease in
   operating margins was primarily due to planned investment in marketing
   initiatives supporting the Company's brand portfolio and key account
   strategy.

   Net nonoperating expenses in 2001 were 2.3% of net sales, or $155.0
   million, versus 2.1%, or $146.2, million in 2000. The increased
   expenses in 2001 are a result of the Company's increased average level
   of debt, partially offset by lower interest rates.

   The effective tax rate was 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001
   versus 38.5% in the prior year.  See Footnote 12 to the Consolidated
   Financial Statements for an explanation of the effective tax rate.

   Net income for 2001 was $264.6 million compared to net income of
   $421.6 million in 2000. Basic and diluted earnings per share in 2001
   decreased to $0.99 versus $1.57 in 2000. Excluding 2001 pre-tax
   charges of $86.1 million ($54.8 million after taxes) as discussed
   above, net income in 2001 was $319.4 million.  Excluding 2000 pre-tax
   charges of $59.7 million ($36.7 million after taxes), net income in
   2000 was $458.3 million.  Diluted earnings per share, calculated on
   the same basis, decreased 29.8% to $1.20 versus $1.71 in 2000.  The
   decrease in net income and earnings per share for 2001 was primarily
   due to internal sales declines and planned investment in the Company's
   marketing initiatives.







   2000 VERSUS 1999

   Net sales for 2000 were $6,934.7 million, representing an increase of
   $222.9 million, or 3.3%, from $6,711.8 million in 1999. Net sales for
   each of the Company's segments (and the primary reasons for the year-
   to-year changes) were as follows:

                                           ========  ========

   Primary reasons for changes:
   (1)  Internal sales growth of 3.8% enhanced by $30.6 million of
        sales contribution from the acquisitions of Rotring and
        Reynolds.
   (2)  Internal sales decline of 1.4% offset by $77.1 million of
        sales contribution from the acquisitions of Ceanothe,
        Mersch, Brio and Panex.
   (3)  Internal sales growth due to shelf space gains at key retailers.

   Gross income as a percent of net sales in 2000 was 26.3%, or $1,826.0
   million, versus 25.9%, or $1,736.4, million in 1999. Excluding costs
   associated with the Rubbermaid merger and certain realignment and
   other charges of $7.9 million and $111.0 million in 2000 and 1999,
   respectively, gross income as a percent of net sales was 26.4%, or
   $1,833.9 million, in 2000 versus 27.5%, or $1,847.4 million, in 1999.
   This decrease in gross margins in 2000 was primarily attributable to
   lower sales volume and higher material costs.

   SG&A in 2000 was 13.0% of net sales, or $899.4 million versus 16.5%,
   or $1,104.5 million, in 1999. Excluding costs associated with the
   Rubbermaid merger and certain realignment and other charges of
   $8.8 million and $178.8 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively,
   SG&A as a percent of net sales was 12.8%, or $890.6 million, in 2000
   versus 13.8%, or $925.7 million, in 1999. The decrease in SG&A expenses
   is primarily the result of integration cost savings at Rubbermaid Home
   Products, Rubbermaid Europe and Little Tikes and tight spending control
   throughout the rest of the Company's core businesses.

   During 2000, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   related primarily to the continued Rubbermaid integration and plant
   closures in the Home Decor segment.  The Company incurred employee




   severance and termination benefit costs related to approximately 700
   employees terminated in 2000.  Such costs included severance and
   government mandated settlements for facility closures at Rubbermaid
   Europe, change in control payments made to former Rubbermaid
   executives, employee terminations at the domestic Rubbermaid divisions
   and severance at the Home Decor segment.  The Company incurred merger
   transaction costs related primarily to legal settlements for
   Rubbermaid's 1998 sale of a former division and other merger related
   contingencies resolved in 2000.  Additionally, the Company incurred
   facility and other exit costs related primarily to the closure of five
   European Rubbermaid facilities, three window furnishings facilities as
   well as the exit of various Rubbermaid product lines. See Footnote 3
   to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a review of the charges.

   During 1999, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   related primarily to the integration of the Rubbermaid business into
   Newell.  Merger transaction costs related primarily to investment
   banking, legal and accounting costs for the Newell/Rubbermaid merger.
   Employee severance and termination benefits related to approximately
   750 employees terminated in 1999.  Such costs included change in
   control payments made to former Rubbermaid executives and severance
   and termination costs at Rubbermaid's former headquarters, Rubbermaid
   Home Products division, Little Tikes division, Rubbermaid Commercial
   Products division and Newell divisions.  Facility and other exit costs
   representing impaired Rubbermaid centralized computer software
   (abandoned as a result of converting Rubbermaid onto existing Newell
   centralized computer software) and costs related to discontinued
   product lines, the closure of seven Rubbermaid facilities, write-off
   of assets associated with abandoned projects and impaired assets and
   other exit costs.  See Footnote 3 to the Consolidated Financial
   Statements for a review of the charges.

   Goodwill amortization as a percentage of net sales was 0.7% in 2000
   and 1999.

   Operating income in 2000 was 12.0% of net sales, or $831.7 million,
   versus 5.1% of net sales, or $343.6 million, in 1999. Excluding
   restructuring and other charges of $59.7 million in 2000 and $531.4
   million in 1999, operating income was $891.4, or 12.9%, of net sales
   in 2000 versus $875.0 million, or 13.0%, of net sales in 1999.

   Net nonoperating expenses in 2000 were 2.1% of net sales, or $146.2
   million, versus 1.7%, or $112.7 million, in 1999. The increased
   expenses in 2000 are a result of the Company's increased level of debt
   and higher interest rates.

   For 2000 and 1999 the effective tax rates were 38.5% and 58.7%,
   respectively. The higher rate in 1999 was primarily due to
   nondeductible transaction costs associated with the Rubbermaid merger.
   See Footnote 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an
   explanation of the effective tax rate.




   Net income for 2000 was $421.6 million, representing an increase of
   $326.2 million from 1999. Basic and diluted earnings per share in 2000
   increased to $1.57 versus $0.34 in 1999. Excluding 2000 pre-tax
   charges of $59.7 million ($36.7 million after taxes) as discussed
   above, net income in 2000 was $458.3 million. Excluding 1999 pre-tax
   charges of $531.4 million ($369.6 million after taxes), net income in
   1999 was $465.0 million. Diluted earnings per share, calculated on the
   same basis, increased 3.6% to $1.71 in 2000 versus $1.65 in 1999. The
   decrease in net income for 2000 was primarily due to increased raw
   material costs and lower sales volume, offset partially by Rubbermaid
   integration cost savings, tight spending control at other core
   businesses and internal growth. Diluted earnings per share increased
   in 2000 versus 1999 as a result of the lower share base due to the
   stock repurchase program.









































   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

   Sources
   -------

   The Company's primary sources of liquidity and capital resources
   include cash provided from operations and use of available borrowing
   facilities.

   Cash provided by operating activities in 2001 was $865.4 million,
   compared to $623.5 and $554.0 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively.
   The increase in operating cash flows is primarily due to improved
   working capital management, principally in the areas of inventory and
   accounts payable.  In 2001, the Company announced an increased focus
   on working capital which resulted in reduced inventory of $148.8
   million and increased accounts payable of $158.9 million.  As a
   result, the Company generated free cash flow (defined by the Company
   as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and
   dividends) of $391.6 million compared to $81.8 million and $128.1
   million in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

   The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of
   credit with various banks which are available for short-term
   financing. Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines of credit
   are subject to the discretion of the lender. The Company's lines of
   credit do not have a material impact on the Company's liquidity.
   Borrowings under the Company's lines of credit at December 31, 2001
   totaled $19.1 million.

   The Company has a revolving credit agreement of $1,300.0 million that
   will terminate in August 2002.  The Company intends to extend the
   revolving credit agreement beyond 2002.  During 2000, the Company
   entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement in the amount of
   $700.0 million which expired in October 2001.  As of December 31,
   2001, there were no borrowings under the remaining $1,300.0 million
   revolving credit agreement.

   In lieu of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement,
   the Company may issue up to $1,300.0 million of commercial paper. The
   Company's revolving credit agreement provides the committed backup
   liquidity required to issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial
   paper may only be issued up to the amount available for borrowing
   under the Company's revolving credit agreement. At December 31, 2001,
   $707.5 million (principal amount) of commercial paper was outstanding.
   Because the backup revolving credit agreement expires in August 2002,
   the entire $707.5 million is classified as current portion of long-
   term debt. The company plans to extend maturities by replacing a
   portion of current debt with longer-term debt facilities.  By
   extending maturities, the Company can reduce its reliance on the
   current commercial paper program.





   The revolving credit agreement permits the Company to borrow funds on
   a variety of interest rate terms. The agreement requires, among other
   things, that the Company maintain a certain Total Indebtedness to
   Total Capital Ratio and limits Subsidiary Indebtedness, as defined in
   the agreement. As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance
   with this agreement.

   The Company had outstanding at December 31, 2001 a total of $1,012.5
   million (principal amount) of medium-term notes. The maturities on
   these notes range from 3 to 30 years at an average interest rate of
   6.34%.  Of the outstanding amount of medium-term notes, $100.0 million
   is classified as current portion of long-term debt and the remainder
   of $912.5 million is classified as long-term debt. A $779.5 million
   universal shelf registration statement became effective in July 1999.
   As of December 31, 2001, $449.5 million of Company debt and equity
   securities may be issued under the shelf.

   On September 18, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with a
   financial institution creating a financing entity which is
   consolidated in the Company's financial statements.  Under the
   agreement, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the
   financing entity to sell an undivided interest in the Company's
   receivables.  In the quarter ended September 30, 2001, the financing
   entity issued $450.0 million in preferred debt securities to a
   financial institution.  Those preferred debt securities must be
   retired or redeemed before the Company can have access to the
   financing entity's receivables.  The receivables and the corresponding
   $450.0 million preferred debt issued by the subsidiary to the
   financial institution are recorded on the consolidated accounts of the
   Company. The proceeds of this debt were used to pay down commercial
   paper.  Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is
   considered to be long-term debt.  The provisions of the debt agreement
   allow the entire outstanding debt to be called upon certain events
   including the Company's long-term senior unsecured debt rating falling
   below Baa2 (Moody's) or BBB (Standard & Poor's) and certain levels of
   accounts receivable write-offs.  As of December 31, 2001, the Company
   was in compliance with the agreement.

   Uses
   ----

   The Company's primary uses of liquidity and capital resources include
   acquisitions, dividend payments and capital expenditures.

   In 2001, cash used for 2001 acquisitions and deferred payments on
   prior acquisitions was $107.5 million.  The Company made several minor
   acquisitions in 2001 for cash purchase prices totaling $61.2 million.
   In 2000, cash used for 2000 acquisitions and deferred payments on
   prior acquisitions was $597.8 million.  The Company acquired Mersch,
   Brio and Paper Mate/Parker and made other minor acquisitions in 2000
   for cash purchase prices totaling $635.2 million. In 1999, cash used
   for 1999 acquisitions and deferred payments on prior acquisitions was



   $345.9 million.  The Company acquired Ateliers, Reynolds, McKechnie,
   Ceanothe and made other minor acquisitions for cash purchase prices
   totaling $397.3 million.

   The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations
   as of December 31, 2001:


   In 2001, the Company made payments on long-term debt, net of proceeds,
   of $354.7 million, compared to net additional borrowings of $836.8
   million in 2000 and $194.7 million in 1999.  The Company's ability to
   pay down additional debt was due primarily to increased focus on
   working capital management (primarily inventory and accounts payable)
   and current year cash earnings.

   Cash used for restructuring activities was $49.7 million, $32.9
   million and $145.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
   and 1999, respectively.  Such payments represent primarily employee
   termination benefits and facility closure and other exit costs related
   to the Company's strategic restructuring plan and recent acquisitions.

   Capital expenditures were $249.8 million, $316.6 million and $200.1
   million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Aggregate dividends paid
   during 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $224.0, $225.1 million and $225.8
   million, respectively.

   On February 7, 2000, the Company announced a stock repurchase program
   of up to $500.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock.
   During 2000, the Company repurchased 15.5 million shares of its common
   stock at an average price of $26 per share, for a total cash price of
   $403.0 million under the program. The repurchase program remained in
   effect until December 31, 2000 and was financed through the use of
   working capital and commercial paper.

   Retained earnings increased in 2001 and 2000 by $40.4 million and
   $196.3 million, respectively. The decrease in the earnings growth rate
   between 2001 and 2000 was primarily due to reduced net income from
   lower than expected sales volume and planned investment in marketing
   initiatives supporting the Company's brand portfolio and key account
   strategy.

   Working capital at December 31, 2001 was $316.8 million compared to
   $1,329.5 million at December 31, 2000 and $1,108.7 million at December
   31, 1999.  The decrease in working capital is primarily due to



   reclassifying $707.5 million in long-term debt in 2000 as current in
   2001 as discussed above, and the Company's increased focus on working
   capital management.

   The current ratio at December 31, 2000 was 1.13:1 compared to 1.86:1
   at December 31, 2000 and 1.68:1 at December 31, 1999.

   Total debt to total capitalization (total debt is net of cash and cash
   equivalents, and total capitalization includes total debt, company-
   obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a
   subsidiary trust and stockholders' equity) was .43:1 at December 31,
   2001, .46:1 at December 31, 2000 and .33:1 at December 31, 1999.

   The Company believes that cash provided from operations and borrowing
   facilities will continue to provide adequate support for the cash
   needs of existing businesses; however, certain events, such as
   significant acquisitions, could require additional external financing.

   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote
   1 of the Footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  As
   disclosed in Footnote 1, the preparation of financial statements in
   conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
   management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that
   affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
   accompanying footnotes.  Future events and their effects cannot be
   determined with absolute certainty.  Therefore, the determination of
   estimates requires the exercise of judgment.  Actual results
   inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may
   be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation
   of the Company's financial statements include estimates as to the
   recovery of accounts receivable, inventory, goodwill and other long-
   lived assets as well as those used in the determination of liabilities
   related to litigation, product liability, customer discounts,
   taxation, restructuring, post-retirement and pension benefits and
   environmental matters.  Various assumptions and other factors underlie
   the determination of these significant estimates.  The process of
   determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into
   account factors such as historical experience, current and expected
   economic conditions, product mix, and in some cases, actuarial
   techniques.  The Company re-evaluates these significant factors as
   facts and circumstances dictate.  Historically, actual results have
   not differed significantly from those determined using the estimates
   described above.

   Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers, net of
   provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as
   volume or trade), co-op advertising and other sales discounts are




   recognized as revenue upon shipment to customers and when all
   substantial risks of ownership change.

   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

   At the beginning of 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
   Accounting Standards ("FAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
   Instruments and Hedging Activities."  This statement requires
   companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or
   liabilities, measured at fair value.  Any changes in fair value of
   these instruments are recorded in the income statement or other
   comprehensive income.  The impact of adopting FAS No. 133 on January
   1, 2001 resulted in a cumulative after-tax gain of approximately $13.0
   million, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  The
   cumulative effect of adopting FAS No. 133 did not materially impact
   the results of operations.

   In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards ("FASB")
   issued FAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", and FAS No. 142,
   "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". FAS No. 141 requires all
   business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted
   for using the purchase method of accounting. Historically, all
   acquisitions by the Company have been accounted for as purchases, thus
   there was no effect on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements
   upon adoption of this standard, in contrast, all mergers have been
   accounted for as poolings of interest.  FAS No. 142 becomes effective
   in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with early adoption
   permitted. The Company plans to early adopt the provisions of FAS No.
   142 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. In accordance with
   this standard, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be
   subject to annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-
   based test. All other intangible assets will continue to be amortized
   over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill amortization expense was
   $57.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001. The
   Company anticipates that the application of the nonamortization
   provisions will increase annual net income by approximately $41.0
   million or $0.15 per share. During 2001 and the first quarter 2002,
   the Company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and
   indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002.  Subject to
   final analysis, the Company expects to record a pre-tax goodwill
   impairment charge of $500.0 million to $550.0 million in the first
   quarter of 2002.

   In August 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 144,  "Accounting for
   Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." This statement
   established a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be
   disposed of by sale and provides additional implementation guidance
   for assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of other than
   by sale. The statement supersedes FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the
   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be
   Disposed Of" and amends the accounting and reporting provisions of
   Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 30 related to the



   disposal of a segment of a business. The statement is effective for
   fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company adopted
   FAS No. 144 on January 1, 2002, and the standard did not have a
   material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

   In August 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") issued EITF
   No. 01-09 "Accounting for Consideration Given by Vendor to a Customer
   or a Reseller of Vendor's Product" which codified and reconciled the
   Task Force's consensuses in EITF 00-14 "Accounting for Certain Sales
   Incentives", EITF 00-22 "Accounting for Points and Certain Other Time
   Based Sales Incentives or Volume Based Sales Incentive Offers, and
   Offers of Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future",
   and EITF 00-25 "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of
   Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products".  These
   EITF's prescribe guidance regarding the timing of recognition and
   income statement classification of costs incurred for certain sales
   incentive programs to resellers and end consumers.  EITF No. 01-09 did
   not impact results of operations because the Company recognizes sales
   incentives upon recognition of revenue and classifies them as
   reductions of gross revenue and recognizes free goods as a cost of
   goods sold when shipped, both in accordance with the prescribed rules.

   In May 2000, the EITF issued EITF No. 00-10 "Accounting for Shipping
   and Handling Fees and Costs."  EITF No. 00-10 requires that amounts
   billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs be
   classified as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and
   handling be classified as a cost of products sold.  Historically,
   these revenues and costs had been netted together and deducted from
   gross sales to arrive at net sales.  The net sales and cost of
   products sold have been restated for this change.  The impact of this
   change increased net sales and cost of products sold by $286.1 million
   and $298.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and December
   31, 1999, respectively.  There was no impact on gross income resulting
   from this change.

   LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

   The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims, including
   various environmental matters, in the ordinary course of its business.
   Such legal proceedings are more fully described in Footnote 15 to the
   Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Although management of
   the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these legal
   proceedings with certainty, it believes that the ultimate resolution
   of the Company's legal proceedings, including any amounts it may have
   to pay in excess of amounts reserved, will not have a material effect
   on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

   INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

   The Company's non-U.S. business is growing at a faster pace than its
   business in the United States. This growth outside the U.S. has been
   fueled by recent international acquisitions, primarily in Europe. For



   the years ended December 31, 2001, December 31, 2000 and  December 31,
   1999, the Company's non-U.S. business accounted for approximately 27%,
   25% and 23% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 14 to the
   Consolidated Financial Statements). Growth of both U.S. and non-U.S.
   businesses is shown below:

   MARKET RISK

   The Company's market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates,
   foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices. Pursuant
   to the Company's policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative
   financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse
   changes in market prices. The Company does not hold or issue
   derivative instruments for trading purposes.

   The Company's primary market risk is interest rate exposure, primarily
   in the United States. The Company manages interest rate exposure
   through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and
   floating rate debt. Interest rate exposure was reduced significantly
   in 1997 from the issuance of $500.0 million 5.25% Company-Obligated
   Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Securities of a
   Subsidiary Trust, the proceeds of which reduced commercial paper.
   Interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when
   appropriate based on market conditions, and, for qualifying hedges,
   the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense.

   The Company's foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes
   hedging anticipated intercompany and third-party commercial
   transaction exposures of one-year duration or less. The Company
   focuses on natural hedging techniques of the following form:

   *    offsetting or netting of like foreign currency cash flows,

   *    structuring foreign subsidiary balance sheets with appropriate
        levels of debt to reduce subsidiary net investments and
        subsidiary cash flows subject to conversion risk,

   *    converting excess foreign currency deposits into U.S. dollars or
        the relevant functional currency and

   *    avoidance of risk by denominating contracts in the appropriate
        functional currency.

   In addition, the Company utilizes short-term forward contracts to
   hedge commercial and intercompany transactions. Gains and losses
   related to qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany
   transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying
   transactions. Derivative instruments are recorded on the Company's
   balance sheet at fair value, and any changes in fair value of these
   instruments are recorded in the income statement or other
   comprehensive income.

   Due to the diversity of its product lines, the Company does not have
   material sensitivity to any one commodity. The Company manages
   commodity price exposures primarily through the duration and terms of
   its vendor contracts.
   The amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic
   loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in either



   interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value-at-risk
   estimation model. The value-at-risk model uses historical foreign
   exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and
   correlation of these rates in future periods. It estimates a loss in
   fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and including
   substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding
   equity-method investments). The fair value losses shown in the table
   below do not have an impact on current results of operations or
   financial condition, but are shown as an illustration of the impact of
   adverse changes in interest rates.

                                          Time      Confidence
                               Amount    Period       Level
                               ------    ------     ----------
    (IN MILLIONS)
    Interest rates             $14.5      1 day        95%
    Foreign exchange            $0.5      1 day        95%

   The 95% confidence interval signifies the Company's degree of
   confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses
   shown above. The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that
   interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the
   Company's favor. The value-at-risk model assumes that all movements in
   these rates will be adverse. Actual experience has shown that gains
   and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly
   unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over
   an extended period of time. These amounts should not be considered
   projections of future losses, since actual results may differ
   significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets.



























   EURO CURRENCY CONVERSION

   On January 1, 1999, the "Euro" became the common legal currency for 11
   of the 15 member countries of the European Union.  On that date, the
   participating countries fixed conversion rates between their existing
   sovereign currencies ("legacy currencies") and the Euro. On January 4,
   1999, the Euro began trading on currency exchanges and became
   available for noncash transactions, if the parties elected to use it.
   On January 1, 2001, another country (Greece) also adopted the Euro,
   fixing the conversion rate against their legacy currency.  The legacy
   currencies remained legal tender through December 31, 2001. On January
   1, 2002, participating countries introduced Euro-denominated bills and
   coins, and effective July 1, 2002, legacy currencies will no longer be
   legal tender.

   After the dual currency phase, all businesses in participating
   countries must conduct all transactions in the Euro and must convert
   their financial records and reports to be Euro-based. The Company has
   substantially completed this conversion process and has deemed its
   information systems to be Euro compliant.  As a result of the Euro
   conversion, the Company experienced no adverse impact to its business
   or financial condition on a consolidated basis.

   ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
             -------------------------------------------

   MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   The management of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. is responsible for the
   accuracy and internal consistency of all information contained in this
   annual report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements.
   Management has followed those generally accepted accounting
   principles, which it believes to be most appropriate to the
   circumstances of the Company, and has made what it believes to be
   reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates where necessary.

   Newell Rubbermaid Inc. operates under a system of internal accounting
   controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that its financial
   records are accurate, that the assets of the Company are protected and
   that the financial statements fairly present the financial position
   and results of operations of the Company. The internal accounting
   control system is tested, monitored and revised as necessary.

   Four directors of the Company, not members of management, serve as the
   Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and are the principal means
   through which the Board oversees the performance of the financial
   reporting duties of management. The Audit Committee meets with
   management and the Company's independent auditors several times a
   year to review the results of the external audit of the Company and to
   discuss plans for future audits. At these meetings, the Audit
   Committee also meets privately with the independent auditors to assure
   its free access to them.

   The Company's independent auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP, audited the
   financial statements prepared by the management of Newell Rubbermaid
   Inc. Their opinion on these statements is presented below.

   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   To the Stockholders of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.:

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newell
   Rubbermaid Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of
   December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 and the related consolidated
   statements of income, Stockholders' equity and comprehensive income
   and cash flows for the years then ended.  These consolidated financial
   statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility
   of Newell Rubbermaid Inc.'s management. Our responsibility is to
   express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
   schedule based on our audits.




   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
   generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that
   we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
   whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
   audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
   amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
   includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
   estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
   financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide
   a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
   fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Newell
   Rubbermaid Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and
   1999 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the
   years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
   accepted in the United States.

   Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
   basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in
   Part IV Item 14(a)(2) of this Form 10-K is presented for the purposes
   of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
   is not part of the basic financial statements.  This schedule has been
   subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the
   basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
   material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein
   in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

   FOOTNOTE 1
   ----------

   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The Consolidated Financial Statements
   include the accounts of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. and its majority owned
   subsidiaries (the "Company") after elimination of intercompany
   accounts and transactions.

   On March 24, 1999, Newell Co. ("Newell") completed a merger with
   Rubbermaid Incorporated ("Rubbermaid") in which Rubbermaid became a
   wholly owned subsidiary of Newell. Simultaneously with the
   consummation of the merger, Newell changed its name to Newell
   Rubbermaid Inc. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests
   and the financial statements have been restated to combine
   retroactively Rubbermaid's financial statements with those of Newell
   as if the merger had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period
   presented.

   USE OF ESTIMATES:  The preparation of these financial statements
   required the use of certain estimates by management in determining the
   Company's assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related
   disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain 2000 and 1999 amounts have been
   reclassified to conform with the 2001 presentation.

   REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales of merchandise and freight billed to
   customers, net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer
   discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), co-op advertising and
   other sales related discounts are recognized upon shipment to
   customers and when all substantial risks of ownership change.  Staff
   Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, which clarified the existing
   accounting rules for revenue recognition, did not impact the Company's
   net sales for any years presented.  In conformity with SAB 101,
   revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are
   satisfied: pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is
   fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and delivery
   has occurred.

   In August 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") issued EITF
   No. 01-09 "Accounting for Consideration Given by Vendor to a Customer
   or a Reseller of Vendor's Product" which codified and reconciled the
   Task Force's consensuses in EITF 00-14 "Accounting for Certain Sales
   Incentives", EITF 00-22 "Accounting for Points and Certain Other Time
   Based Sales Incentives or Volume Based Sales Incentive Offers, and
   Offers of Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future",
   and EITF 00-25 "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of
   Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products".  These
   EITF's prescribe guidance regarding the timing of recognition and
   income statement classification of costs incurred for certain sales



   incentive programs to resellers and end consumers.  EITF No. 01-09 did
   not impact results of operations because the Company recognizes sales
   incentives upon recognition of revenue and classifies them as
   reductions of gross revenue and recognizes free goods as a cost of
   goods sold when shipped, both in accordance with the prescribed rules.

   In May 2000, the EITF issued EITF No. 00-10 "Accounting for Shipping
   and Handling Fees and Costs."  EITF No. 00-10 requires that amounts
   billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs be
   classified as revenue and all expenses related to shipping and
   handling be classified as a cost of products sold.  Historically,
   these revenues and costs had been netted together and deducted from
   gross sales to arrive at net sales.  The net sales and cost of
   products sold have been restated for this change.  The impact of this
   change increased net sales and cost of products sold by $286.1 million
   and $298.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and December
   31, 1999, respectively.  There was no impact on gross income resulting
   from this change.

   DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  The Company's
   financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts
   receivable, notes payable, short and long-term debt and Company-
   obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Securities of a
   Subsidiary Trust.  The fair value of these instruments approximates
   carrying values due to their short-term duration, except as follows:

             Derivative Instruments:  The fair value of the
             Company's derivative instruments is recorded in the
             Consolidated Balance Sheets and is described in more
             detail in Footnote 7.

             Long-term Debt: The fair value of the Company's long-
             term debt issued under the medium-term note program is
             estimated based on quoted market prices which
             approximate cost as of December 31, 2001. All other
             significant long-term debt is pursuant to floating rate
             instruments whose carrying amounts approximate fair
             value.

             Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible
             Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary Trust:   The fair
             value of the $500.0 million company-obligated
             mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities
             of a subsidiary trust was $377.5 million at December 31,
             2001, based on quoted market prices.

   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash and highly liquid short-term
   investments having a maturity of three months

   ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Allowances for doubtful accounts at
   December 31 totaled $57.9 million in 2001, $36.1 million in 2000 and
   $41.9 million in 1999.  On January 22, 2002, one of the Company's
   largest customers filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the
   Bankruptcy Code.  The Company increased bad debt provisions throughout
   2001 to adequately reserve for this bankruptcy.

   INVENTORIES:  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
   value. Cost of certain domestic inventories (approximately 63%, 59%
   and 67% of total inventories at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
   respectively) was determined by the "last-in, first-out" ("LIFO")
   method; for the balance, cost was determined using the "first-in,
   first-out" ("FIFO") method. If the FIFO inventory valuation method had
   been used exclusively, inventories would have increased by $20.1
   million, $15.9 million and $11.4 million at December 31, 2001, 2000
   and 1999, respectively. Inventory reserves (excluding LIFO reserves)
   at December 31 totaled $117.3 million in 2001, $114.6 million in 2000
   and $119.4 million in 1999. The components of net inventories were as
   follows:

   OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS: The Company has a 49% ownership interest
   in American Tool Companies, Inc., a manufacturer of hand tools and
   power tool accessory products marketed primarily under the Vise-
   Grip{R} and Irwin{R} trademarks. This investment is accounted for on
   the equity method with a net investment of $79.5 million at December
   31, 2001.  The Company's share of undistributed earnings of the
   investment included in consolidated retained earnings was $43.9
   million at December 31, 2001.

   LONG-TERM MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES:  Long-term marketable equity
   securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value
   with adjustments to fair value reported separately, net of tax, as a
   component of accumulated other comprehensive income (and excluded from
   earnings). Gains and losses on the sales of long-term marketable
   equity securities are based upon the average cost of securities sold.
   The Company sold all of its marketable equity securities in December
   2001, and realized a $5.0 million pre-tax loss.  Long-term marketable
   equity securities for prior years are summarized as follows:

   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:  Replacements and improvements are
   capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
   expense. Depreciation expense is calculated to amortize, principally
   on the straight-line basis, the cost of the depreciable assets over
   their depreciable lives. Maximum useful lives determined by the
   Company are: buildings and improvements (20-40 years) and machinery
   and equipment (3-12 years).  Property, plant and equipment consisted
   of the following:

   TRADE NAMES AND GOODWILL:  In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
   Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting
   Standards ("FAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" and No. 142,
   "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" effective for fiscal years
   beginning after December 31, 2001. Under the new rules, goodwill and
   intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be
   amortized, but will be subject to periodic impairment tests in
   accordance with the statements. Other intangible assets will continue
   to be amortized over their useful lives. The statement also required
   business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted
   for using the purchase method of accounting, and broadens the criteria
   for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill.

   Effective January 1, 2002, all amortization expense on goodwill and
   intangible assets with indefinite lives will stop. The Company
   anticipates that the application of the nonamortization provisions
   will increase annual net income by approximately $41.0 million or
   $0.15 per diluted share. During 2001 and the first quarter 2002, the
   Company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and
   indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002.  Subject to
   final analysis, the Company expects to record a pre-tax goodwill
   impairment charge of $500.0 million to $550.0 million in the first
   quarter of 2002.

   The cost of trade names and goodwill represents the excess of cost
   over identifiable net assets of businesses acquired. Prior to the
   adoption of FAS 141, the Company did not allocate such excess cost to
   trade names separate from goodwill, but allocated it to other
   identifiable intangible assets recorded in long-term Other Assets.
   Through the year ended December 31, 2001, trade names and goodwill
   were amortized over 40 years and other identifiable intangible assets
   were amortized over 5 to 20 years.  Trade names and goodwill consisted
   of the following:

   LONG-LIVED ASSETS:  Subsequent to acquisition, the Company
   periodically evaluates whether later events and circumstances have
   occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-
   lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of
   long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If factors indicate that
   long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the
   Company uses an estimate of the relevant business' undiscounted net
   cash flow over the remaining life of the long-lived assets in
   measuring whether the carrying value is recoverable. An impairment
   loss would be measured by reducing the carrying value to fair value,
   based on a discounted cash flow analysis.

   In August 2001, the FASB issued FAS No. 144,  "Accounting for
   Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." This statement
   established a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be
   disposed of by sale and provides additional implementation guidance
   for assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of other than
   by sale. The statement supersedes FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the
   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be
   Disposed Of" and amends the accounting and reporting provisions of
   Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 30 related to the
   disposal of a segment of a business. The statement is effective for
   fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.  The adoption of FAS
   No. 144 on January 1, 2002 will require separate presentation of the
   discontinued operations for the Company's pending divestiture of
   Anchor Hocking Glass ("Anchor"), as disclosed further in Footnote 2.

   OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES:  Customer accruals are promotional
   allowances and rebates given to customers in exchange for their
   selling efforts. The self-insurance accrual is primarily casualty
   liability such as workers' compensation, general and product liability
   and auto liability and is estimated based upon historical loss
   experience.  Accrued liabilities included the following:

      liability                             107.2       99.9       92.0

   FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:  Foreign currency balance sheet accounts
   are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at
   fiscal year end. Income and expenses are translated at the average
   rates of exchange in effect during the year. The related translation
   adjustments are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive
   income. International subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary
   economies translate nonmonetary assets at historical rates, while net
   monetary assets are translated at current rates, with the resulting
   translation adjustment included in net income as other nonoperating
   (income) expenses. Foreign currency transaction losses were $1.9
   million, $1.9 million and $1.1 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
   respectively.

   ADVERTISING COSTS:  The Company expenses advertising costs as
   incurred, including cooperative advertising programs with customers.
   Total cooperative advertising expense was $196.8 million, $209.2
   million and $205.3 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
   Cooperative advertising is recorded in the Consolidated Financial
   Statements as a reduction of sales because it is viewed as part of the
   negotiated price of products. All other advertising costs are charged
   to selling, general and administrative expenses and totaled $100.3
   million, $80.0 million and $80.0 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
   respectively.

   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS:  Research and development costs
   relating to both future and present products are charged to selling,
   general and administrative expenses as incurred. These costs
   aggregated $67.2 million, $49.4 million and $49.9 million in 2001,
   2000 and 1999, respectively.

        exclude the dilutive effect of approximately 3.9 million, 7.6
        million and 4.2 million options, respectively, since such options
        had an exercise price in excess of the average market value of
        the Company's common stock during the respective years.
   (2)  The convertible preferred securities are anti-dilutive in 2001,
        2000 and 1999 and, therefore, have been excluded from diluted
        earnings per share.  Had the convertible preferred shares been
        included in the diluted earnings per share calculation, net
        income would be increased by $16.8 million, $16.4 million and
        $16.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively and weighted
        average shares outstanding would have increased by 9.9 million
        shares in all years.

   comprehensive income encompass net income, net after-tax unrealized
   gains or losses on securities available for sale, foreign currency

   of Stockholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income. The following table

   paid $635.2 million in cash and assumed
   $15.0 million of debt.

    Ceanothe Holding    Picture Frames     December 29    Calphalon/WearEver

   For these and for other minor acquisitions made in 1999, the Company
   paid $397.3 million in cash and assumed
   $45.1 million of debt.

   The transactions summarized above were accounted for as purchases;
   therefore, results of operations are included in the accompanying
   Consolidated Financial Statements since their respective acquisition
   dates.  The acquisition costs for the 2001 acquisitions were allocated





   on a preliminary basis to the fair market value of the assets acquired
   and liabilities assumed.  The Company's finalized integration plans
   may include exit costs for certain plants and product lines and
   employee termination costs.  The final adjustments to the purchase
   price allocations are not expected to be material to the Consolidated
   Financial Statements.  The preliminary purchase price allocations for
   the 2001 acquisitions and the finalized purchase price allocations for
   the 2000 and 1999 acquisitions resulted in trade names and goodwill of
   approximately $705.9 million.

   The Company began to formulate integration plans for the Paper
   Mate/Parker, Brio and Mersch SA acquisitions as of their respective
   dates of acquisition.  The integration plans for these acquisitions
   were finalized during 2001 and resulted in integration plan
   liabilities of $67.9 million for facility and other exit costs, $32.6
   million for employee severance and termination benefits and $3.4
   million for other pre-acquisition contingencies.  These reserves are
   primarily related to the closure of Paper Mate manufacturing
   facilities in California and integration of Paper Mate's European
   operations into existing Newell European writing instruments
   businesses.  In addition, integration reserves were established for
   the closure of several Mersch and Brio facilities as these businesses
   are integrated into existing Newell European picture frame businesses.
   As of December 31, 2001, $32.4 million of integration plan reserves
   remain related to the 2000 and 1999 acquisitions.

   None of the 2001 acquisitions were included in the pro forma
   calculations because their effect was immaterial.  The unaudited
   consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31,
   2001 and 2000 on a pro forma basis, as though the 2000 acquisitions of
   Mersch, Brio and Paper Mate/Parker had been acquired on January 1,
   2000, are as follows (unaudited):

   On March 24, 1999, the Company completed the Rubbermaid merger. The
   merger qualified as a tax-free exchange and was accounted for as a
   pooling of interests. Newell issued .7883 Newell Rubbermaid shares
   (those of the Company as a combined entity) for each outstanding share
   of Rubbermaid common stock. A total of 119.0 million shares (adjusted
   for fractional and dissenting shares) of the Company's common stock
   were issued as a result of the merger, and Rubbermaid's outstanding
   stock options were converted into options to purchase approximately
   2.5 million Newell Rubbermaid common shares.

   No adjustments were made to the net assets of the combining companies
   to adopt conforming accounting practices or fiscal years other than
   adjustments to eliminate the accounting effects related to Newell's
   purchase of Rubbermaid's office products business ("Eldon") in 1997.
   Because the Newell Rubbermaid merger was accounted for as a pooling of
   interests, the accounting effects of Newell's purchase of Eldon have
   been eliminated as if Newell had always owned it.

   The following table presents a reconciliation of net sales and net

   PENDING DIVESTITURE

   On June 18, 2001, the Company announced the sale of Anchor for $322.0
   million.  On January 14, 2002, the Federal Trade Commission  ("FTC")
   filed a complaint challenging the legality of the sale of Anchor.  The
   FTC believes the sale of Anchor to the current buyer could create a
   monopoly in the market for glassware in the foodservice industry.  On
   January 21, 2002, the Company signed an amended agreement with the
   buyer to divest of Anchor, excluding the foodservice business, for
   $277.5 million.  The Company is defending the restructured




   transaction.  Annual net sales from Anchor (including the foodservice
   business) totaled $196.6 million, $206.7 million and $210.8 million
   for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
   Anchor is included in the Calphalon/WearEver segment.

   Effective January 1, 2002, the carrying amount of Anchor will be
   classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in
   accordance with FAS No. 144.  The results of operations for Anchor
   will be reported separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income
   as a discontinued operation.  The expected gain from this divestiture
   will be recognized when the sale is finalized.

   RESTRUCTURING COSTS

   Certain expenses incurred in the reorganization of the Company's
   operations are considered to be restructuring expenses.  Pre-tax
   restructuring costs consisted of the following:

   Restructuring provisions were determined based on estimates prepared
   at the time the restructuring actions were approved by management.
   An analysis of the Company's restructuring plan reserves is as
   follows (IN MILLIONS):


   *    Cash paid for restructuring activities was $49.7 million, $32.9
        million and $145.5 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.





   The facility and other exit cost reserves of $20.1 million at
   December 31, 2001 are primarily related to future minimum lease
   payments on a vacated Levolor/Hardware European facility and closure
   costs related to six additional facilities (one at Rubbermaid, one at
   Parker/Eldon, two at Levolor/Hardware and two at Calphalon/WearEver).
   Severance reserves of $6.2 million at December 31, 2001 are primarily
   related to payments to approximately 25 former Newell executives who
   are receiving severance payments under employment agreements.  As of
   December 31, 2001, $1.9 million of reserves remain for restructuring
   charges recorded in 1999 for contractual commitments on abandoned
   Rubbermaid computer software.  No other restructuring reserves remain
   from the 2000 and 1999 restructuring charges.

   ----
   During 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   associated with the Company's strategic restructuring plan.  The
   restructuring plan is intended to streamline the Company's supply
   chain to ensure its position as the low cost global provider
   throughout the Company's product portfolio.  The plan consists of
   reducing worldwide headcount over the three years beginning in 2001,
   and includes consolidating duplicate manufacturing facilities.  As
   part of this plan, the Company incurred employee severance and
   termination benefit costs for approximately 1,700 employees.
   Additionally, the Company incurred facility exit costs related
   primarily to the closure of 14 facilities (four at Rubbermaid, one at
   Parker/Eldon, six at Levolor/Hardware and three at
   Calphalon/WearEver).
























   ----
   During 2000, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   related primarily to the continued Rubbermaid integration and plant
   closures in the Home Decor segment.  The Company incurred employee
   severance and termination benefit costs related to approximately 700
   employees terminated in 2000.  Such costs included severance and
   government mandated settlements for facility closures at Rubbermaid
   Europe, change in control payments made to former Rubbermaid
   executives, employee terminations at the domestic Rubbermaid
   divisions and severance at the Home Decor segment.  The Company
   incurred merger transaction costs related primarily to legal
   settlements for Rubbermaid's 1998 sale of a former division and other
   merger related contingencies resolved in 2000.  Additionally, the
   Company incurred facility and other exit costs related primarily to
   the closure of five European Rubbermaid facilities, three window
   furnishings facilities as well as the exit of various Rubbermaid
   product lines.

   ----
   During 1999, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges
   related primarily to the integration of the Rubbermaid business into
   Newell.  Merger transaction costs related primarily to investment
   banking, legal and accounting costs for the Newell/Rubbermaid merger.
   Employee severance and termination benefits related to approximately
   750 employees terminated in 1999.  Such costs included change in
   control payments made to former Rubbermaid executives and severance
   and termination costs at Rubbermaid's former headquarters, Rubbermaid
   Home Products division, Little Tikes division, Rubbermaid Commercial
   Products division and Newell divisions.  Facility and other exit
   costs representing impaired Rubbermaid centralized computer software
   (abandoned as a result of converting Rubbermaid onto existing Newell
   centralized computer software) and costs related to discontinued
   product lines, the closure of seven Rubbermaid facilities, write-off
   of assets associated with abandoned projects and impaired assets and
   other exit costs.

   CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

   The Company has short-term foreign and domestic uncommitted lines of
   credit with various banks which are available for short-term
   financing. Borrowings under the Company's uncommitted lines of credit
   are subject to the discretion of the lender. The Company's
   uncommitted lines of credit do not have a material impact on the
   Company's liquidity.  The following is a summary of borrowings under
   foreign and domestic lines of credit:

                                         =======     =======   =======


   The Company has a revolving credit agreement of $1,300.0 million that
   will terminate in August 2002. During 2000, the Company entered into
   a 364-day revolving credit agreement in the amount of $700.0 million.
   The 364-day revolving credit agreement terminated in October 2001. At
   December 31, 2001, there were no borrowings under the remaining
   $1,300.0 million revolving credit agreement.

   In lieu of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement,
   the Company may issue commercial paper. The Company's revolving
   credit agreement provides the committed backup liquidity required to
   issue commercial paper. Accordingly, commercial paper may only be
   issued up to the amount available for borrowing under the Company's
   revolving credit agreement. At December 31, 2001, $707.5 million
   (principal amount) of commercial paper was outstanding. Because the
   backup revolving credit agreement expires in August 2002, the entire
   $707.5 million is classified as current portion of long-term debt.

   The revolving credit agreement permits the Company to borrow funds on
   a variety of interest rate terms.  The agreement requires, among
   other things, that the Company maintain a certain Total Indebtedness
   to Total Capital Ratio and limits Subsidiary Indebtedness, as defined
   in the agreement.  As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in
   compliance with this agreement.

   The Company had outstanding at December 31, 2001 a total of $1,012.5
   million (principal amount) of medium-term notes. The maturities on
   these notes range from 3 to 30 years at an average interest rate of
   6.34%.  Of the outstanding amount of medium-term notes, $100.0
   million is classified as current portion of long-term debt and $912.5
   million is classified as long-term debt.  A $779.5 million universal



   shelf registration statement became effective in July 1999. As of
   December 31, 2001, $449.5 million of Company debt and equity
   securities may be issued under the shelf registration statement.

   On September 18, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with a
   financial institution creating a financing entity which is
   consolidated in the Company's financial statements.  Under the
   agreement, the Company regularly enters into transactions with the
   financing entity to sell an undivided interest in the Company's trade
   receivables to the financing entity.  In the quarter ended September
   30, 2001, the financing entity issued $450.0 million in preferred
   debt securities to a financial institution.  Those preferred debt
   securities must be retired or redeemed before the Company can have
   access to the financing entity's receivables.  The receivables and
   the corresponding $450.0 million preferred debt issued by the
   subsidiary to the financial institution are recorded in the
   Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company. The proceeds of this debt
   were used to pay down commercial paper issued by the Company.
   Because this debt matures in 2008, the entire amount is considered to
   be long-term debt.  The provisions of the debt agreement allow the
   entire outstanding debt to be called upon certain events including
   the Company's debt rating falling below investment grade (Baa2;
   Moody's debt rating and BBB; Standard & Poor's debt rating), and
   certain levels of accounts receivable write-offs.  As of December 31,
   2001, the Company was in compliance with the agreement.

   The aggregate maturities of long-term debt outstanding are as
   follows:

   COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED
   SECURITIES OF A SUBSIDIARY TRUST

   The Company fully and unconditionally guarantees 10.0 million shares
   of 5.25% convertible preferred securities issued by a 100% owned
   finance subsidiary of the Company, which are callable at 103.15% of
   the liquidation preference, decreasing over time to 100% by December
   2007. Each of these "Preferred Securities" is convertible into 0.9865
   of a share of Company common stock, and is entitled to a quarterly
   cash distribution at the annual rate of $2.625 per share.

   The proceeds of the Preferred Securities were invested in $500.0
   million of Company 5.25% Junior Convertible Subordinated Debentures.
   The Debentures are the sole assets of the subsidiary trust, mature on
   December 1, 2027, bear interest at an annual rate of 5.25%, are
   payable quarterly and became redeemable by the Company beginning in
   December 2001. The Company may defer interest payments on the
   Debentures for a period up to 20 consecutive quarters, during which
   period distribution payments on the Preferred Securities are also
   deferred. Under this circumstance, the Company may not declare or pay
   any cash distributions with respect to its common or preferred stock
   or debt securities that do not rank senior to the Debentures.

   As of December 31, 2001, the Company has not elected to defer
   interest payments.  The $500.0 million of the Preferred Securities is
   classified as Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible
   Preferred Securities of a Subsidiary Trust in the Consolidated
   Balance Sheet.

   DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   At the beginning of 2001, the Company adopted FAS No. 133,
   "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  This
   statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance
   sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value.  Any changes
   in fair value of these instruments are recorded in the income
   statement or other comprehensive income.  The impact of adopting FAS
   No. 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in a cumulative after-tax gain of
   approximately $13.0 million, recorded in accumulated other
   comprehensive income.  The cumulative effect of adopting FAS No. 133
   did not materially impact the results of operations.

   The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial
   instruments and does not use them for trading purposes.  Derivative
   financial instruments are used to manage certain interest rate and
   foreign currency risks.  These instruments include interest rate
   swaps, long-term cross currency interest rate swaps, and short-term
   forward exchange contracts.

   The Company entered into several interest rate swap agreements,
   designated as cash flow hedging relationships, as a means to mitigate
   the risk of rising interest rates in future periods by converting
   certain floating rate debt instruments into fixed rate debt.  Gains
   and losses on these instruments, to the extent that the hedge
   relationship has been effective, are deferred in other comprehensive
   income and recognized in interest expense over the period in which
   the Company recognizes interest expense on the related debt
   instrument.  Any ineffectiveness on these instruments is immediately
   recognized in interest expense in the period that the ineffectiveness
   occurs.  During 2001 the ineffectiveness related to these instruments
   was insignificant.  The maximum length of time over which the Company
   is hedging its interest rate exposure through the use of interest
   rate swap agreements is seven years, and the Company expects
   approximately $10.9 million of losses, net of tax, deferred in other
   comprehensive income to be recognized in earnings over the 12 months
   ended December 31, 2002.  At December 31, 2001, the Company had
   interest rate swaps with an outstanding notional principal amount of
   $372.0 million, with accrued interest payable of $1.6 million.

   The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts to manage foreign
   exchange risk related to both known and anticipated intercompany
   transactions and third-party commercial transaction exposures of one
   year duration or less.  The Company also utilizes long-term cross
   currency interest rate swaps to hedge long-term intercompany
   transactions.  The maturities on these long-term cross currency
   interest rate swaps range from three to five years.  At December 31,
   2001, the Company had long-term cross currency interest rate swaps




   with an outstanding notional principal amount of $337.3 million, with
   accrued interest receivable of $2.9 million.

   Gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts,
   which hedge intercompany transactions or third-party commercial
   transactions, are deferred in other comprehensive income with a
   corresponding asset or liability until the underlying transaction
   occurs and are considered to have a cash flow hedging relationship.
   The gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive
   income will be reclassified to earnings upon completion of the
   underlying transaction being hedged.  The net loss recognized in 2001
   for matured cash flow forward exchange contracts was $1.0 million,
   which was recognized in the income statement. The Company estimates
   $0.6 million of losses, net of tax, deferred in accumulated other
   comprehensive income will be recognized in earnings over the 12
   months ending December 31, 2002.

   Derivative instruments used to hedge intercompany loans are marked to
   market with the corresponding gains or losses included in accumulated
   other comprehensive income and are considered to have a fair value
   hedging relationship.  The net gain recognized in 2001 for forward
   exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps was $2.2
   million, which was recognized as part of interest income on the
   income statement.

   The following table summarizes the Company's short-term forward
   exchange contracts and long-term cross currency interest rate swaps
   in U.S. dollars by major currency and contractual amount. The "buy"
   amounts represent the U.S. equivalent of commitments to purchase
   foreign currencies, and the "sell" amounts represent the U.S.
   equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies according to the
   local needs of the subsidiaries. The contractual amounts of
   significant short-term forward exchange contracts and long-term cross
   currency interest rate swaps and their fair values as of December 31,
   2001 were as follows:

   due to foreign exchange rate movement, since gains and losses on
   these instruments generally offset gains and losses on the assets,
   liabilities, and other transactions being hedged.  The Company does
   not obtain collateral or other security to support derivative
   financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit
   standing of the counterparties.

   LEASES

   The Company leases manufacturing and warehouse facilities, real
   estate, transportation, data processing and other equipment under
   leases which expire at various dates through the year 2013. Rent
   expense was $112.0 million, $102.9 million and $91.9 million in 2001,
   2000 and 1999, respectively. Future minimum rental payments for
   operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one
   year are as follows:

   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND RETIREMENT PLANS

   As of December 31, 2001, the Company continued to maintain various
   deferred compensation plans with varying terms.  The total liability
   associated with these plans was $52.3 million, $49.2 million and
   $49.6 million as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
   These liabilities are included in Other Noncurrent Liabilities in the
   Consolidated Balance Sheet. These plans are partially funded with
   asset balances of $41.9 million, $39.6 million and $37.6 million as
   of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  These assets are
   included in Other Noncurrent Assets in the Consolidated Balance
   Sheet.

   Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted a deferred
   compensation plan pursuant to which certain management and highly
   compensated employees are eligible to defer up to 50% of their
   regular compensation and up to 100% of their bonuses, and nonemployee
   board members are eligible to defer up to 100% of their directors
   compensation.  The compensation deferred under this plan along with
   earnings is fully vested at all times.

   The Company has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"),
   which is a nonqualified defined benefit plan pursuant to which the
   Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key
   employees upon retirement based upon the employees' years of service
   and compensation.  The SERP is being funded through a trust agreement
   with the Northern Trust Company, as trustee, that owns life insurance
   policies on key employees.  At December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the
   life insurance contracts had a cash surrender value of $56.0 million,
   $44.1 million and $30.0 million, respectively.  These assets are
   included in Other Noncurrent Assets in the Consolidated Balance
   Sheet.  The amount of coverage is designed to provide sufficient
   reserves to cover all costs of the plan.  The projected benefit
   obligation was $59.8 million, $57.1 million and $44.8 million at
   December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  The SERP liabilities
   are included in the pension table below; however, the Company's
   investment in the life insurance contracts are excluded from the
   table as they do not qualify as plan assets under FAS No. 87,
   Employers' Accounting for Pensions.

   The Company and its subsidiaries have noncontributory pension, profit
   sharing and contributory 401(k) plans covering substantially all of
   their foreign and domestic employees. Pension plan benefits are
   generally based on years of service and/or compensation. The
   Company's funding policy is to contribute not less than the minimum
   amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
   1974, as amended, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or
   local statutes to assure that plan assets will be adequate to provide
   retirement benefits. The Company's common stock comprised $56.6



   million, $46.7 million and $48.7 million of noncontributory pension
   plan assets at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

   The Company's matching contributions to the profit sharing plans were
   $15.4 million, $14.5 million and $12.3 million for the years ended
   December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

   In addition, several of the Company's subsidiaries currently provide
   retiree health care and life insurance benefits for certain employee
   groups.

   The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan
   assets and funded status of the Company's noncontributory pension
   plans, SERP and postretirement benefit plans within the guidelines of
   FAS No. 132:

   The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and

    Fair value of plan assets         307.0       -        50.8

   Assumed health care cost trends have been used in the valuation of
   postretirement benefits. The trend rate is 6% in 2001, but will
   increase to 10% (for retirees under age 65) and 12% (for retirees
   over age 65) in 2002, declining to 6% for all retirees in 2009 and
   thereafter.  The Company increased the medical care cost trend due to
   significant increases in actual medical costs.

   The health care cost trend rate significantly affects the reported
   postretirement benefit costs and obligations. A one percentage point
   change in the assumed rate would have the following effects:

                                  1% Increase    1% Decrease

   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

   At December 31, 2001, the Company's common stock consists of 800.0
   million authorized shares with a par value of $1.00 per share.

   On February 7, 2000, the Company announced a stock repurchase program
   of up to $500.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock.
   During 2000, the Company repurchased 15.5 million shares of its
   common stock at an average price of $26.00 per share, for a total
   cash price of $403.0 million under the program. The repurchase
   program remained in effect until December 31, 2000 and was financed
   through the use of working capital and commercial paper.

   Each share of common stock includes a stock purchase right (a
   "Right"). Each Right will entitle the holder, until the earlier of
   October 31, 2008 or the redemption of the Rights, to buy the number
   of shares of common stock having a market value of two times the
   exercise price of $200.00, subject to adjustment under certain
   circumstances. The Rights will be exercisable only if a person or
   group acquires 15% or more of voting power of the Company or
   announces a tender offer after which it would hold 15% or more of the
   Company's voting power. The Rights held by the 15% stockholder would
   not be exercisable in this situation.

   Furthermore, if, following the acquisition by a person or group of
   15% or more of the Company's voting stock, the Company was acquired
   in a merger or other business combination or 50% or more of its
   assets were sold, each Right (other than Rights held by the 15%
   stockholder) would become exercisable for that number of shares of
   common stock of the Company (or the surviving company in a business
   combination) having a market value of two times the exercise price of
   the Right.

   The Company may redeem the Rights at $0.001 per Right prior to the
   occurrence of an event that causes the Rights to become exercisable
   for common stock.

   STOCK OPTIONS

   The Company's stock option plans are accounted for under APB Opinion
   No. 25. As a result, the Company grants fixed stock options under
   which no compensation cost is recognized. Had compensation cost for
   the plans been determined consistent with FAS No. 123, the Company's
   net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the
   following pro forma amounts:

    Year Ended December 31,              2001        2000       1999
                                         ----        ----       ----
    (In millions, except per share data)
    Net income:
      As reported                        $264.6     $421.6      $95.4
      Pro forma                           249.1      410.5       88.2
    Diluted earnings per share:
      As reported                          $0.99      $1.57      $0.34
      Pro forma                             0.93       1.53       0.31

   Because the FAS No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to
   options granted prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma
   compensation cost may not be representative of that to be expected in
   future years.

   The Company has authorized 16.1 million shares of common stock to be
   issued under various stock option plans.  As of January 1, 2001,
   under the Company's primary 1993 Stock Option Plan, the Company could
   grant options for up to 13.3 million shares, of which the Company has
   granted 12.0 million options and canceled 2.4 million options through
   December 31, 2001. Under this plan, the option exercise price equals
   the common stock's closing price on the date of the grant, and
   options vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the
   date of grant.

   The following summarizes the changes in the number of shares of
   common stock under option, including options to acquire common stock
   resulting from the conversion of options under pre-merger Rubbermaid
   option plans:

   assumptions used for grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively:
   risk-free interest rate of 5.1%, 6.5% and 6.6%; expected dividend
   yields of 3.0%, 3.0% and 2.0%; expected lives of 9.0, 9.0 and 9.0
   years; and expected volatility of 28%, 28% and 25%.

   The Company generated losses in certain jurisdictions and legal
   entities for which management believes it is unlikely that such
   benefits will be realized and, therefore, provided a valuation
   allowance against such benefits.  Approximately $17.4 million of the
   total net operating loss benefits relate to the acquisition of the
   Gillette Stationery Products Group in 2000.  To the extent that these
   losses are utilized in the future, such benefits will reduce goodwill
   associated with this acquisition.

   FOOTNOTE 15

   LITIGATION

   The Company is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course
   of its business.  These proceedings include claims for damages
   arising out of use of the Company's products, allegations of
   infringement of intellectual property, commercial disputes and
   employment matters as well as the environmental matters described
   below.  Some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as
   well as compensatory damages, and a few proceedings purport to be
   class actions.

   As of December 31, 2001, the Company was involved in various matters
   concerning federal and state environmental laws and regulations,
   including matters in which the Company has been identified by the
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental
   agencies as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at contaminated
   sites under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
   Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and equivalent state laws.

   In assessing its environmental response costs, the Company has
   considered several factors, including: the extent of the Company's
   volumetric contribution at each site relative to that of other PRPs;
   the kind of waste; the terms of existing cost sharing and other
   applicable agreements; the financial ability of other PRPs to share
   in the payment of requisite costs; the Company's prior experience
   with similar sites; environmental studies and cost estimates
   available to the Company; the effects of inflation on cost estimates;
   and the extent to which the Company's and other parties' status as
   PRPs is disputed.

   The Company's estimate of environmental response costs associated
   with these matters as of December 31, 2001 ranged between $14.2
   million and $18.1 million. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had a
   reserve equal to $15.8 million for such environmental response costs
   in the aggregate. No insurance recovery was taken into account in
   determining the Company's cost estimates or reserve, nor do the
   Company's cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for
   present value purposes, except with respect to two long-term (30
   year) operations and maintenance CERCLA matters which are estimated
   at present value.

   Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental
   investigations and response activities, the possibility that the
   Company could be identified as a PRP at sites identified in the
   future that require the incurrence of environmental response costs
   and the possibility of additional sites as a result of businesses




   acquired, actual costs to be incurred by the Company may vary from
   the Company's estimates.

   Although management of the Company cannot predict the ultimate
   outcome of these legal proceedings with certainty, it believes that
   the ultimate resolution of the Company's legal proceedings, including
   any amounts it may be required to pay in excess of amounts reserved,
   will not have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated
   Financial Statements.
