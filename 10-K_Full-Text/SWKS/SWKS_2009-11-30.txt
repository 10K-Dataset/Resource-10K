INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

We believe there are several key growth trends shaping the wireless industry. First is the advent
of the mobile Internet, where consumers are increasingly demanding mobile devices with faster data
rates, advanced image quality and improved Web connections. We believe this demand is one of the
biggest secular growth trends in technology.

On the
high-end of the cellular handset market, smart phone growth — which is at the heart of the
mobile Internet phenomenon — is fostering this industry wide sea change. In effect, the smart
phone is moving from a higher end tool reserved for the corporate executive to an increasingly
mainstream communication platform necessity — one that is changing the way in which we live, work
and play. Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, are only fueling this trend.
Furthermore, this segment is being embraced and widely promoted by carriers who benefit from the
highly profitable data services revenue stream as subscribers move to enhanced data plans.

Another trend in the wireless industry is the convergence of multimedia-rich mobile devices and the
recognition of the increasingly important role multimode Front-End Modules (“FEM”) play in the
rapidly evolving wireless handset market, particularly as the industry migrates to 3G and 4G
technologies which enable applications such as Web browsing, video streaming, gaming, MP3 players
and cameras. Next-generation EDGE, WEDGE and WCDMA wireless platforms are becoming the majority of
the more than one billion cellular phones the industry produces annually. With this accelerating
trend, the complexity in the FEM increases as each new operating frequency band requires additional
amplifier, filtering and switching content to support:

•

backward compatibility to existing networks,

•

simultaneous transmission of voice and data,

•

international roaming, and

•

broadband functionality to accommodate music, video, data, and other multimedia
features.

Further, given constraints on handset size and power consumption, these complex modules must remain
physically small, energy efficient and cost effective, while also managing an unprecedented level
of potential signal interference within the handset.



Finally, and a direct result of this increasing front-end module complexity, the addressable
semiconductor content within the transmit and receive chain portion of the cellular handset is
increasing. We believe this trend is creating an incremental market
opportunity measured in the billions of dollars as switching, filtering and wireless local area networking functionality are
integrated.

Meanwhile, outside of the handset market, wireless technologies are also rapidly proliferating.
According to Gartner, a leading independent market research firm, the total available market for
the analog semiconductor segment is expected to exceed $15 billion in 2011. Today, this adjacent
analog semiconductor market, which is characterized by longer product lifecycles and relatively
high gross margins, is fragmented and diversified among various end-markets, customer bases and
applications including:

SKYWORKS’ STRATEGY

Skyworks’ mission is to achieve mobile connectivity leadership through semiconductor innovation.
Key elements in our strategy include:

Diversifying Our Business

By leveraging our core analog and mixed signal technology, Skyworks is able to deliver solutions to
a broad and diverse set of end markets and customers. In the handset market, we currently support
all five tier-one handset manufacturers as well as the leading smart phone suppliers, and have
strategic relationships with each key baseband supplier. In non-handset markets, we continue to
take advantage of our catalog business, intellectual property and worldwide distribution network,
to bolster our product pipeline and expand our addressable markets
beyond the approximately  1,000 global
customers and  2,500 analog components currently marketed.



Diversifying our Business

Gaining Market Share

Our customer engagements are increasingly centered on solving highly complex multimode, multiband,
switching, filtering, digital control and amplification challenges — system-level requirements
which intersect with Skyworks’ core competencies. Skyworks continues to invest in developing architectures which optimize power efficiency while
minimizing cost and footprint, allowing us to meet customers’ demanding next-generation technology
requirements as well as stringent quality standards and manufacturing scale necessities.

Capitalizing on Content Growth in Third and Fourth Generation Applications

As the industry migrates to multi-mode EDGE, WEDGE, WCDMA and LTE architectures across a multitude
of wireless broadband applications, RF complexity in the transmit and receive chain substantially
increases given simultaneous voice and high speed data communications requirements, coupled with
the need for backward compatibility to existing networks. As a result of this complexity in the
front-end module, our addressable market is
increasing significantly.

Capitalizing on Content Growth



Delivering Operational Excellence

Skyworks’
strategy is to vertically integrate our supply chain where we can differentiate or otherwise enter
alliances and strategic relationships for leading-edge capabilities. This hybrid manufacturing
approach allows us to better balance external capacity with the demands of the marketplace.
Internally, our capacity  utilization remains high and we are therefore able to maintain margins and our
return on invested capital on a broader range of revenues. We are focused on achieving the
industry’s shortest cycle times, highest yields and ultimately the lowest product cost structure.

SKYWORKS’ PRODUCT PORTFOLIO

Our product portfolio consists of:



•

Technical Ceramics:

polycrystalline oxide materials
used for a wide variety of electrical, mechanical, thermal and
magnetic applications

•

Transceivers:

devices that have both a transmitter and a receiver which are combined
and share common circuitry or a single housing

•

VCOs/Synthesizers:

fully integrated, high performance signal source for high dynamic
range transceivers

We believe we possess a broad technology capability and one of the most complete wireless
communications product portfolios in the industry.

THE SKYWORKS ADVANTAGE

By turning complexity into simplicity, we provide our customers with the following competitive
advantages:

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

Our products are primarily sold through a direct Skyworks sales force. This team is globally
deployed across all of our major market regions. In some markets we supplement our direct sales
effort with independent manufacturers’ representatives, assuring broader coverage of territories
and customers. We also utilize distribution partners, some of which are franchised globally with
others focused in specific regional markets (e.g., Europe, North America, China and Taiwan).

We maintain an internal marketing organization that is responsible for developing sales and
advertising literature, print media, such as product announcements and catalogs, as well as a
variety of Web-based content. Skyworks’ sales engagement begins at the earliest stages in a
customer design. We strive to provide close technical collaboration with our customers at the
inception of  new programs. This relationship allows our team to facilitate customer-driven
solutions, which leverage the unique strength of our product portfolio while providing high value
and greatly reducing time-to-market.

We believe that the technical and complex nature of our products and markets demand an
extraordinary commitment to maintain intimate ongoing relationships with our customers. As such, we
strive to expand the scope of our customer relationship to include design, engineering,
manufacturing, purchasing and project management. We also employ a collaborative approach in
developing these relationships by combining the support of our design teams, applications
engineers, manufacturing personnel, sales and marketing staff and senior management.



We believe that maintaining frequent and interactive contact with our customers is paramount to our
continuous efforts to provide world-class sales and service support. By listening and responding to
feedback, we are able to mobilize resources to raise the level of customer satisfaction, improve
our ability to anticipate future product needs, and enhance our understanding of key market
dynamics. We are confident that diligence in following this path will position Skyworks to
participate in numerous opportunities for growth in the future.

REVENUES FROM AND DEPENDENCE ON CUSTOMERS; CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION

For information regarding customer concentration and revenues from external customers for each of
the last three fiscal years, see Note 18 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

We own and are licensed under numerous United States and foreign patents and patent applications
related to our products, our manufacturing operations and processes, and other activities. In
addition, we own a number of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and
services. We believe that intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trade
secrets and trademarks are of material importance to our business. We rely on patent, copyright,
trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and
confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary
technologies, devices, algorithms and processes. We cannot guarantee that these efforts will
meaningfully protect our intellectual property, and others may independently develop substantially
equivalent proprietary technologies, devices, algorithms or processes. In addition, the laws of
some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the
United States, and effective copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret protection may not be
available in those jurisdictions. In addition to protecting our proprietary technologies and
processes, we strive to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to
obtain cross-licenses of intellectual property from others, to obtain access to intellectual
property we do not possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims
against us. Furthermore we seek to generate high gross margin revenue through the sale and license
of non-core intellectual property and occasionally purchase intellectual property to support our
core business. Due to rapid technological changes in the industry, we believe that establishing and
maintaining a technological leadership position depends primarily on our ability to develop new
innovative products through the technical competence of our engineering personnel.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

We compete on the basis of time-to-market, new product innovation, overall product quality and
performance, price, compliance with industry standards, strategic relationships with customers and
baseband vendors, and protection of our intellectual property. Certain competitors may be able to
adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer
requirements, or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of
their products than we can.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances. Recognizing the
importance of such technological advances, we maintain a high level of research and development
activities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help
identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands.  We are focusing our development efforts on new products, design tools and manufacturing
processes using our core technologies. Our research and development expenditures for fiscal years
ended October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007 were $124.0 million, $146.0 million,
and $126.1 million, respectively. The reduction in research and development expenditures between
fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2009 was principally the result of the exit of non-core product
areas in the second quarter of fiscal 2009.

RAW MATERIALS

Raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several
sources. It is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other
conditions dictate otherwise. Consequently,



there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from
single or limited sources. We purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual
purchase orders. However, we have a limited number of long-term supply contracts with our
suppliers. Certain of our suppliers consign raw materials to us at our manufacturing facilities. We
request these raw materials and take title to them as they are needed in our manufacturing process.
We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our
manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world.

BACKLOG AND INVENTORY

Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products, with
such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions. We
also maintain Skyworks-owned finished goods inventory at certain customer “hub” locations. We do
not recognize revenue until these customers consume the Skyworks-owned inventory from these hub
locations. Due to industry practice, which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance
notice to us prior to shipment, and with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any
particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels. The cancellation or
deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a
change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which
could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment,
the disposal of hazardous wastes, and other activities affecting the environment have had, and will
continue to have, an impact on our manufacturing operations. Most of our customers have mandated
that our products comply with local and regional lead free and other “green” initiatives. We
believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation
necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection, and other
expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims, will not have a material adverse effect on
our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. We cannot assess
the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

SEASONALITY

Sales of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in
end-user consumer applications, such as cellular handsets. The highest demand for our handset
products generally occurs in the calendar quarter ending in December. The lowest demand for our
handset products generally occurs in the calendar quarter ending in March.

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For information regarding net revenues by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal
years, see Note 18 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The majority of our tangible long lived
assets are located in the United States of America and Mexico (see
Note 18 of Item 8). Risks attendant to our
foreign operations are discussed in Item 1A-Risk Factors.

EMPLOYEES

As of October 2, 2009, we employed approximately 3,300 persons. Approximately 400 of our employees
in Mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information
contained in this report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition
or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties
described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or other
factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may
impair our business operations, financial condition or results from operations.



We operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is subject
to significant downturns.

We operate primarily in the wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and
subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise
markets. Recently, weak and uncertain economic conditions worldwide, together with other factors
such as the continued volatility of the financial markets, have made it difficult for our customers
and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. If such uncertainty and
economic weakness continues, the market for wireless communications semiconductor products could
further contract and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations for
our current fiscal year would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of
industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand, manufacturing overcapacity,
excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Furthermore, downturns
in the wireless communications semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or
failure of the wireless semiconductor market to recover from an economic downturn would materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations beyond our current
fiscal year.

Our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations
and market downturns.

Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated substantially on a quarterly and
annual basis in the past and our revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in
the future. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our
control.

These factors include, among others:

The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could
materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating results
fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect
the price of our common stock.



Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.

The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such
fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:

Public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This
volatility has significantly and negatively affected the market prices of securities of many
technology companies, including the market price of our common stock. These broad market
fluctuations may further materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in
future periods.

In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading
multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift
funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. Our
company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such
commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meet
the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may
decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.

The wireless communications semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition
which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and rapid loss of market share and may
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete
in particular are very competitive. We compete with U.S. and international semiconductor
manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including RF Micro Devices and
Avago.

We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product
competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result
in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or
increasing market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of
growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign
and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal
competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:

•

rapid time-to-market and product ramp,

•

timely new product innovation,

•

product quality, reliability and performance,

•

product price,



We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy the
benefit of:

As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging
technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the
development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.

Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or
strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These
relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new
competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market
share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors.
Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market
share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.

The wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, the markets into
which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid
technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards,
short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased
miniaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our
operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and
enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of
semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including:



•

the length of time that a particular product is in demand, and

•

the ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.

Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends, among other
factors, on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems, or IT
Systems.

We will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and to
choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market growth. We may
not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor products
in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or
achieve market acceptance or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and
technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements
and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary
products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and
cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our
customers’ requirements, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely
harmed.

In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. Our
products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow
us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly, we believe that
to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing
products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We may not be
able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to remain competitive.

If OEMs and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not
design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover,
a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.

Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other
products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to
select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without
these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs
another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to
achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost,
time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a
customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer. Even after a
design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to
reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially
successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert
design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our
operating results.

Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond
our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process
consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean
environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment, errors in any step of
the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in
equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial
percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction. Because our
operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at
acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material adverse affect on our
business. In addition, although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we
may discover from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be
required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and
indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilities
associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are capped at
significant amounts, or are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resources
from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or
others, including liability for costs associated with product



recalls, or other obligations under customer contracts, which may adversely impact our operating
results. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility
problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our
products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.

Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at
any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors. These disruptions may result from
electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or
risks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/or
upgrades such as the conversion to a 6” wafer manufacturing line currently in process at our
Newbury Park, California facility. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause
significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility
or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor. In the event of such delays, the required
alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely
basis or at all. Even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available,
we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a
loss of customers. We may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand,
either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others.

Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing
process, in the event of a disruption at the Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusetts
semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production
capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our
gross margin and profitability.

Minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing
yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended. Manufacturing yields for new
products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume
manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward
product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result,
material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on
our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields
and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be
magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our
manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life
cycles, which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while
maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the
longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining
costs.

We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and test of our products.

We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-based
products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant
risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:

•

the lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,

•

limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and quality
assurance, and

•

the inaccessibility of, or delays in, obtaining access to, key process technologies.

Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing
capacity, the third-party foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production
requirements of other customers. If we choose to use a new foundry, it will typically take an
extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products
from the new foundry. The foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver
products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly
since some of them are located in earthquake zones. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity
occurs, we may not



have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience
difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our
ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Although we own and operate a test and assembly facility, we still depend on subcontractors to
package, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have
long-term agreements with any of our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services
from these suppliers on a per order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity
constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power
outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain
alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due
to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers, we could
experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative
assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery,
quality or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and
adversely affect our results of operations. We are continuing to develop relationships with
additional third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products. However, even if we use
these new subcontractors, we will continue to be subject to all of the risks described above.

We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.

Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the
components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain
relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have
adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs,
increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components can
result in tighter supplies. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may
lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality
specifications and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or material at a competitive cost.
If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules or if we lost a supplier or a supplier
were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer
obligations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships
with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In
connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more
suppliers. We may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw
material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our
raw materials, we are currently dependent on a sole-source supplier for epitaxial wafers used in
the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities. If we
were to lose this sole source of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business
could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole
supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our
supply arrangements would be exacerbated.

Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material
adverse effect on the results of our operations.

Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost
one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its
orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Sales to our
three largest OEM/distribution customers in fiscal 2009, Samsung Electronics Co., Sony Ericsson Mobile
Communication AB (SEMC), and Asian Information Technology, Inc. (AIT), including sales to their
manufacturing subcontractors (in the case of SEMC and Samsung), represented approximately 38% of
our net revenues for fiscal 2009.

If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design,
development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our
business.

As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a
significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate
qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel.
The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry,
and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified management and
other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and



sale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel
during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock,
given among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. The loss
of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and
motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our
business.

Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in
significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.

After our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six
months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months
or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle
time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which
could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we
may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative
expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never
generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer
cancels or changes its product plans.

Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adversely
affect our business.

Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term supply
arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we
sell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsold
products if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates
of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be
compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both,
as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In
addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The
cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or
overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or
obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition.

In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in
demand or for any other reason, the customer’s ability to make timely payments to us for
non-returnable products could be impaired.

We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands
that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us
from using our technology.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual
property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert
patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are
important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their
technology or refrain from using it.

Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe
intellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractual
indemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and
divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the
merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical
issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result
in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:

•

pay substantial damages,

•

cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,

•

discontinue the use of infringing technology,



•

expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and

•

license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms.

Our operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of
our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.

In addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found
to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer
could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing
product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from
our customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it
could have an adverse impact on our operating results.

Many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties. If licenses to
such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business
could be adversely affected.

We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving
industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing
levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain
technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain
competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and
conditions, and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology, our products or our customers’
products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances,
we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute
technology to deliver competitive products.

If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, it may harm our ability to
compete.

We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well
as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary
technologies, information, data, devices, algorithms and processes. In addition, we often
incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our
designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party
intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like
activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to
determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This
could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our
management and technical personnel from our business operations. We cannot be assured that:

•

the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other
violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers,
suppliers or other third parties will be successful,

•

any existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other
intellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged, invalidated or
circumvented, or

•

any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection.

Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use
our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around our
patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology,
it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting in
loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be
broad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive
patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection
in foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret
protection may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.



We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through
operational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or
current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without our
authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems
or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt our
operations. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the
methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.

We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.

A substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the United
States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have
suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test
facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own packaging,
assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subject
to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited
to, risks regarding:

Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide
subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively
impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could
impact the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in South
Korea, Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.



We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.

To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are
insufficient to fund our future activities or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise
additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market
conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise
sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). Failure to obtain capital
when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.

In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our
business may require additional capital resources. The capital required to fund these investments
and acquisitions may not be available in the future.

Our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.

On October 2, 2009, we had total indebtedness of approximately $129.7 million, which represented
approximately 10.5% of our total capitalization. Although our cash and cash equivalents balance
currently exceeds our total indebtedness, we have long-term debt obligations that mature in 2012,
and we may require additional financing prior to the maturity of such debt in order to allow us to
sufficiently fund our research and development, capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital
and other cash requirements, particularly if our short-term revolving credit facility were not
renewed.

Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences, including:

Despite our current debt levels, we believe we are able to incur substantially more debt, which
would increase the risks described above.

We have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses.

In the past, weak global economic conditions have led to a slowdown in customer orders, an increase
in the number of cancellations and rescheduling of backlog, and higher overhead costs as a
percentage of our reduced net revenue. These factors contributed to operating losses for our
business in the past. While we had positive operating results during the last three fiscal years,
we may experience future losses as a result of a significant downturn in the economy, as a result
of corporate restructuring activities, as a result of market factors beyond our control, or as a
result of a combination of the foregoing.

Accounting Rule Changes for Certain Convertible Debt Instruments Will Alter Trends Established in
Previous Periods.

In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASC 470-20-

Debt, Debt with
Conversion and Other Options

(“ASC 470-20”)

.

On October 3, 2009, we will adopt ASC 470-20. This
Topic alters the



accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either
mandatory or optional cash settlements.
Specifically, it will significantly increase the non-cash interest expense associated with our
existing 1.25% and 1.50% convertible notes, and previously held 4.75% convertible notes including
interest expense in prior periods. This accounting guidance will result in significantly higher
non-cash interest expense in fiscal year 2010 and beyond, as well as non-cash interest expense in
prior periods which has yet to be determined.

Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry
process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.

In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to
increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes
for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existing
products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process
technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields,
delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and
expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In
some instances, we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry
processes successfully. Our foundries may not be able to effectively manage the transition or we
may not be able to maintain our foundry relationships. If our foundries or we experience
significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater
levels of functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into our
products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new
integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.

Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign our
existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce
our products.

The electronics industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number of
domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of
which have been used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of
Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive now requires that
certain substances be removed from all electronics components. Removing such substances requires
the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances, as
well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance
with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product
offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be
available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be
significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to
be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or
restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.

We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which could
adversely impact our business.

We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing
operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental
protection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. Current or future regulation
of the materials necessary for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Environmental regulations often require parties to
fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is
often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential
liabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to
compliance with environmental regulations. The amount of expense and capital expenditures that
might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to
continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.



Our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.

Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and
components, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenide
integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differential
is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with
smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Therefore, to remain competitive, we must offer
gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts.
If we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify
the cost differential, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We expect
the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing
their silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies
for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance. We may
not continue to identify products and markets that require performance attributes of gallium
arsenide solutions.

To be successful we may need to effect investments, alliances and acquisitions, and to integrate
companies we acquire.

Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in
internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes
and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to
pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review
investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment
our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and
consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if
such transactions are consummated, they could result in:

Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult,
expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and
customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition,
we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment.
When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with
a charge against earnings.

Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for
someone to acquire control of us.

We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of
incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that
would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our
Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:

•

the division of our Board of Directors into three classes to be elected on a
staggered basis, one class each year,

•

the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one
or more series without further authorization of stockholders,



In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any
business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the
time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors
then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the
stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are
met.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

From time to time, various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been, and may in the future be,
instituted or asserted against the Company, including those pertaining to patent infringement,
intellectual property, environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment and
contractual matters.

Additionally, the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of
intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future
assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are
important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their
technology. The outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some such
lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company. Generally speaking,
intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief, which, if imposed against
the Company, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, or results of
operations. From time to time we are also involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of
business.

We believe that there is no pending litigation involving the Company that will have, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce
global headcount by approximately 4% or 150 employees. The total charges related to the plan
were $19.4 million of which $3.5 million was charged to cost of goods sold for inventory
write-downs.

During fiscal 2006, we recorded $23.3 million of inventory charges and reserves primarily
related to the exit of our baseband product area.

(2)

During fiscal 2006, we recorded bad debt expense of $35.1 million
 related to certain baseband customers.



(3)

The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 is primarily due to the
acquisitions completed in October 2007 and in May 2009.

(4)

In fiscal 2009, we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce global headcount by
approximately 4% or 150 employees. The total charges related to the plan were $19.4 million
of which $16.0 million was charged to restructuring and other charges. This primarily
consisted of $4.5 million related to severance and benefits, $5.6 million related to the
impairment of long-lived assets, $2.1 million related to lease obligations, $2.3 million
related to the impairment of technology licenses and design software and $1.5 million related
to other charges.

In fiscal 2007, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $4.9 million related to the
exit of the baseband product area.

In fiscal 2006, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $27.0 million related to the
exit of our baseband product area.

(5)

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded approximately $6.1 million of costs
relating to the early retirement of $17.4 million of our 1.25% convertible subordinated notes.
This is offset by a $2.0 million gain recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2009
relating to the early retirement of $40.5 million of the Company’s 1.50% convertible
subordinated notes. The notes were retired at a gain of approximately $2.9 million offset by
a $0.9 million write-off of deferred financing costs.

In fiscal 2008, we recorded approximately $5.8 million of premium in excess of par value and
$1.0 million of deferred financing costs relating to the early retirement of $62.4 million of
1.25% and 1.50% convertible subordinated notes.

(6)

Fiscal years ended October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29,
2006 included $23.5 million, $23.2 million, $13.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, of
share-based compensation expense due to the adoption of the Statement of ASC
718-

Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”)

.

(7)

Based on the Company’s evaluation of the realizability of its United States net deferred tax
assets through the generation of future taxable income, $40.9 million, $40.0 million and $14.2
million of the Company’s valuation allowance was reversed during the fiscal years ended
October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively. For fiscal 2009, the
amount reversed consisted of $27.7 million recognized as income tax benefit, and $13.2 million
recognized as a reduction to goodwill. For fiscal 2008, the amount reversed consisted of
$36.4 million recognized as income tax benefit, and $3.6 million recognized as a reduction to
goodwill. For fiscal 2007, the amount reversed consisted of $1.7 million recognized as income
tax benefit, and $12.5 million recognized as a reduction to goodwill.

We market and sell our products directly to Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) of
communication electronic products, third-party Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”) and contract
manufacturers, and indirectly through electronic components distributors. We periodically enter
into revenue generating arrangements that leverage our broad intellectual property portfolio by
licensing or selling our

non-core

patents or other intellectual property. We anticipate continuing this
intellectual property strategy in future periods.

Overall revenues in fiscal 2009 decreased by $57.4 million, or 6.7%, from fiscal 2008. This revenue
decline was principally due to a reduction in demand in our end markets as a result of adverse
global macroeconomic conditions, in addition to our exit from certain product areas such as mobile
transceivers in the second fiscal quarter of 2009. Net revenues from our top three customers
decreased to 38.2% for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 as compared to 43.5% for the
corresponding period in the prior year, reflecting continued diversification of our customer base.

Overall revenues in fiscal 2008 increased by $118.3 million, or 15.9%, from fiscal 2007. This
revenue growth was principally due to the ramp of new mobile platform products, the addition of new
mobile platform customers,



diversification into new, adjacent markets and the expansion of our market share in increasingly
complex front-end modules at our existing customers.

For information regarding net revenues by geographic region and customer concentration for each of
the last three fiscal years, see Note 18 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold consists primarily
of purchased materials, labor and overhead (including depreciation and equity based compensation
expense) associated with product manufacturing.

We maintained relatively consistent gross profit margins of 40% for the fiscal year ended October
2, 2009 as compared to the prior fiscal year despite a year-over-year decrease in the overall
revenue base between the two fiscal years. This was principally the result of aggressive
year-over-year material cost reductions, yield improvements, leverage of our fixed costs and cost
control measures including capacity management enhanced by the flexibility of our hybrid
manufacturing model. Gross profit in aggregate dollars decreased $24.7 million between fiscal year
2009 and fiscal year 2008 primarily as the result of the aforementioned $57.4 million decrease in
overall revenues. In fiscal year 2009, we continued to benefit from higher gross margins
associated with intellectual property revenues.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues improved to 39.9% in fiscal year 2008, from 38.7% in
fiscal year 2007, and was principally the result of a more favorable revenue mix. Additionally,
gross profit margin improved as a result of higher equipment efficiencies at all of our factories
as our established hybrid manufacturing model with multiple external foundries allows us to
maintain high internal capacity utilization by using second-sources for high fixed cost services
like foundry and assembly. This approach provides supply chain flexibility, lower capital
investment, the ability to meet upside demand and provides cost advantages. Furthermore, yield
improvements and year-over-year material cost reductions along with the increased overall revenue
contributed to the gross profit and margin improvement in both aggregate dollars and as a
percentage of sales. In fiscal year 2008, we continued to benefit from higher gross margins
associated with intellectual property revenue.

Research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs, costs for
pre-production evaluation and testing of new devices, masks and engineering prototypes, equity
based compensation expense and design and test tool costs.

The decrease in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net
revenues for fiscal year 2009 when compared to fiscal year 2008 is principally attributable to the
restructuring plan implemented on January 22, 2009 in which we exited non-core product areas.

The increase in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars for fiscal year 2008 when
compared to fiscal year 2007 is principally attributable to increased labor and benefit costs and
increases in engineering builds



and mask expenditures and variable materials and supplies expenses as we continued to invest in new
product developments in both our mobile platforms and linear product areas.

Selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged in aggregate dollars for
fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net revenues increased for fiscal year 2009, as compared to fiscal year 2008, due to
the aforementioned decline in fiscal year 2009 revenue.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in aggregate dollars for fiscal year 2008 as
compared to fiscal year 2007, primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense, higher
incentive compensation costs and higher sales commissions. Selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007, as
a result of net revenue growth greater than increases in selling, general and administrative costs.

The increase in amortization expense during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 as compared to
fiscal year 2008 is due to additional amortization expense on intangible assets recorded as part of
the acquisition of Axiom Microdevices, Inc., completed in the third fiscal quarter of 2009.

The increase in amortization expense during the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 as compared to
fiscal 2007 is due to the acquisitions completed in October 2007 and the associated amortizable
customer relationships, patents, order backlog, foundry services agreement and developed technology
that were acquired. In fiscal 2008, the gross of our amortizable intangible assets increased by
approximately $13.2 million.

In 2002, we recorded $36.4 million of intangible assets consisting of developed technology,
customer relationships and a trademark acquired by the Company. These assets are principally being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10-year period.

Restructuring and other charges consist of charges for asset impairments and restructuring
activities, as follows:

On January 22, 2009, we implemented a restructuring plan to realign our costs given current
business conditions. We exited our mobile transceiver product area and reduced global headcount by approximately 4%, or
150 employees which resulted in a reduction to annual operating expenditures of approximately $20
million. We recorded various charges associated with this action. In total, we recorded $16.0
million of restructuring and other charges and $3.5 million in inventory write-downs that were
charged to cost of goods sold.

The $16.0 million charge includes the following: $4.5 million related to severance and benefits,
$5.6 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived
assets, which were written down to their salvage values,  $2.1 million related to the
exit of certain operating leases, $2.3 million related to the impairment of technology licenses and
design software, and $1.5 million related to other charges. These charges total $16.0 million and
are recorded in restructuring and other charges.

Interest expense is comprised principally of payments in connection with the $50.0 million credit
facility between Skyworks USA, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, and Wachovia Bank, N.A.
(“Facility Agreement”), the Company’s 4.75% convertible subordinated notes (the “Junior Notes”),
and the Company’s 1.25% and 1.50% convertible subordinated notes (the “2007 Convertible Notes”).

The decrease in interest expense for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 as compared to fiscal
2008 in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is due to the early retirement of
$57.9 million of the Company’s 2007 Convertible Notes in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal
2009.

The decrease in interest expense for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 as compared to fiscal
2007 in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is due to the retirement of the
remaining $49.3 million of higher interest rate Junior Notes during the first quarter of fiscal
2008 and the early retirement of $62.4 million of the Company’s 2007 Convertible Notes in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we retired $40.5 million principal amount of our 2007
Convertible Notes due in 2012. We recorded a gain of $2.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal
2009 related to the early retirement of these notes, reflecting a $2.9 million discount received on
the early retirement of these notes offset by a $0.9 million write-off of deferred financing costs.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we retired $17.4 million of our 2007 Convertible Notes due in
2010. We recorded a loss of $6.1 million in the fourth quarter related to the early retirement of
these notes. We retired a total of $57.9 million of our 2007 Convertible Notes in fiscal year 2009.

In September 2008, we retired $50.0 million and $12.4 million of our 2007 Convertible Notes due in
2010 and 2012, respectively. We recorded a loss of $6.8 million during the three months and fiscal
year ended October 3, 2008 related to the early retirement of these notes. Approximately $5.8
million of this charge represents a premium paid to retire the notes and $1.0 million of the charge
represents a write-off of deferred financing costs.

Income tax benefit for fiscal 2009 was $(27.5) million as compared to a $(28.8) million benefit for
fiscal 2008 and $(0.9) million for fiscal 2007.  The fiscal 2009 benefit  is
due to a $(45.5) million reduction in the valuation allowance related to
current year utilization and
the recognition of future
tax benefits on United States state net operating losses, credit carryforwards, and other temporary
items and United States income tax benefit of $(1.0) million, offset by reserves for tax
uncertainties of $0.3 million. The fiscal 2008 benefit of $(28.2) million is due to a $(36.4)
million reduction in the valuation allowance related to the partial recognition of future tax
benefits on United States federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards, offset by
United States income tax expense of $1.2 million, and a charge in lieu of tax expense of $7.0
million. The fiscal 2008 charge in lieu of tax expense resulted from a partial recognition of
certain acquired tax benefits that were subject to a valuation allowance at the time of
acquisition, the realization of which required a reduction of goodwill. The fiscal 2007 United
States income tax benefit of $(2.2) million is due to a



$(1.7) million reduction in the valuation allowance related to the partial recognition of future
tax benefits on United States federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal
of $(0.5) million of tax reserve no longer required.

The provision (benefit) for foreign income taxes for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $0.9 million,
$(0.6) million, and $1.3 million, respectively. The foreign tax benefit for fiscal 2008 included a
reversal of $(1.0) million of reserves for tax uncertainties that are no longer required.

In accordance with GAAP, management has determined that it is more likely than not that a portion
of our historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized. Accordingly, as of
October 2, 2009, we have maintained a valuation allowance of $26.6 million of which $25.0 million
relates to our United States deferred tax assets and $1.6 million relates to our foreign
operations.

Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating taxable income in the future.
We have considered several factors in evaluating our capacity to generate future earnings. Skyworks
has produced a strong earnings trend generating cumulative earnings before income taxes of $204.7
million in fiscal years 2007 through 2009. In addition, despite the current economic slowdown,
earnings before income taxes of $65.7 million were reported for fiscal year 2009. Based on
management’s evaluation of the realizability of its net deferred tax assets through the generation
of future income, $40.9 million of our valuation allowance was reversed at October 2, 2009. The
amount reversed consisted of $27.7 million recognized as income tax benefit, and $13.2 million
recognized as a reduction to goodwill, which includes $5.6 million related to the acquired Axiom
deferred tax assets. The remaining valuation allowance as of October 2, 2009 is $26.6 million,
principally related to state research tax credits that management has determined is more likely
than not that it will not be realized. When recognized, the tax benefits relating to any future
reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as follows:
approximately $22.3 million will be recognized as an income tax benefit, $0.4 million will be
recognized as a reduction to goodwill and $3.9 million will be recognized as an increase to
shareholders’ equity for certain tax deductions from employee stock options.

We will
continue to evaluate our valuation allowance in future periods and depending upon the
outcome of that assessment, additional amounts could be reversed or recorded and recognized as a
reduction to goodwill or an adjustment to income tax benefit or expense. Such adjustments could
cause our effective income tax rate to vary in future periods. We will need to generate $181.3
million of future United States federal taxable income to utilize all of our federal net operating
loss carryforwards and federal research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards as of October
2, 2009.

No provision has been made for United States, state, or additional foreign income taxes related to
approximately $4.9 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are
intended to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the United States federal
income tax liability, if any, which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently
reinvested.

On September 29, 2007, we adopted ASC 740-

Income Taxes

(“ASC 740”) — (formerly referenced as FASB
Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109)

. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. ASC 740 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This statement also
provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in the
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The provisions of ASC 740 will be applied to all
income tax provisions commencing from that date.

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at October 2, 2009, $6.5 million would impact the effective
tax rate, if recognized. There are no positions which we anticipate could change within the next
twelve months.

On October 1, 2007, Mexico enacted a new “flat tax” regime which became effective January 1, 2008.
GAAP prescribes that the effect of the new tax on deferred taxes must be included in tax expense in
the period that includes the enactment date. The effect of recording deferred taxes in the first
fiscal quarter of 2008 to the foreign tax provision
(benefit) was $(0.2) million. We have accrued
flat tax for the year ended October 2, 2009 of $0.5 million.

FISCAL 2009

Based on our results of operations for fiscal 2009, along with current trends, we expect our
existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be
sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures, debt obligations, working
capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we cannot be certain
that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future. In addition, any
strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require
additional capital resources. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet our capital
needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms (if at all), our business and operations could be
materially adversely affected.

Cash and cash equivalent balances increased $139.1 million to $364.2 million at October 2, 2009
from $225.1 million at October 3, 2008. We generated $210.1 in cash from operations during the
fiscal year ended October 2, 2009, which was offset by the retirement of $57.9 million of the 2007
Convertible Notes, capital expenditures of $39.2 million and expenditures on acquisitions of $10.4
million. The number of days sales outstanding for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 decreased
to 46 from 57 for fiscal 2008.

During fiscal 2009, we generated net income of $93.3 million. We experienced a decrease in
receivables and inventories of $29.9 million and $15.7 million, respectively, an increase in
accounts payable of $9.2 million and incurred multiple non-cash charges (e.g., depreciation,
amortization, contribution of common shares to savings and retirement plans, share-based
compensation expense, non-cash restructuring expense, asset impairments and inventory write-downs)
totaling $93.5 million. This was offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities of $2.5 million, an
increase to other assets of $3.9 million, and an increase to our deferred tax assets of $27.2
million (primarily the result of a partial release of our tax valuation allowance in fiscal 2009).

Cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009, consisted of
investments in capital equipment of $39.2 million primarily to expand fabrication and assembly and
test capacity. We believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our
current manufacturing capabilities and can be funded by the generation of positive cash flows from
operations. We also made payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $10.4 million. We may
also consider additional future acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and
design expertise and to expand our product offerings.

Cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009, consisted of early
retirement of $57.9 million of our 2007 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of treasury stock of $2.4
million, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $38.7 million. For additional
information regarding our borrowing arrangements, see Note 9 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Our invested cash balances primarily consist of money market funds and repurchase agreements where
the underlying securities primarily consist of United States treasury obligations, United States
agency obligations, overnight repurchase agreements backed by United States treasuries and/or
United States agency obligations and highly rated commercial paper. Our invested cash balances also
include time deposits/certificates of deposit. At October 2, 2009, we also held a $3.2 million
auction rate security which historically has provided liquidity through a Dutch auction process.
Disruptions in the credit markets have substantially eliminated the liquidity of this process
resulting in failed auctions. During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, we performed a
comprehensive valuation



and discounted cash flow analysis on the auction rate security. We
concluded the value of the auction rate security was $2.3 million, and the carrying value of these
securities was reduced by $0.9 million, reflecting this change in fair value. Accordingly,
in the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, we recorded unrealized losses on this auction rate
security of approximately $0.9 million. We assessed these declines in fair market value to be
temporary and consider the security to be illiquid until there is a successful auction or the
security matures. Accordingly, the remaining auction rate security balance has been reclassified
to non-current other assets and the loss has been recorded in Other Comprehensive Income.
We will continue to monitor the liquidity and accounting classification of this security in future
periods. If in a future period, we determine that the impairment is other than temporary, we will
impair the security to its fair value and charge the loss to earnings.

On July 15, 2003, we entered into a receivables purchase agreement under which we have agreed to
sell from time to time certain of our accounts receivable to Skyworks USA, Inc. (“Skyworks USA”), a
wholly-owned special purpose entity that is fully consolidated for accounting purposes.
Concurrently, Skyworks USA entered into an agreement with Wachovia Bank, N.A. providing for a $50.0
million credit facility (“Facility Agreement’’) secured by the purchased accounts receivable. As a
part of the consolidation, any interest incurred by Skyworks USA related to monies it borrows under
the Facility Agreement is recorded as interest expense in the Company’s results of operations. We
perform collections and administrative functions on behalf of Skyworks USA. Interest related to the
Facility Agreement is at LIBOR plus 0.75%. We renewed the Facility Agreement for another year in
July 2009, and as of October 2, 2009, Skyworks USA had borrowed $50.0 million under this agreement.

FISCAL 2008

Cash and cash equivalent balances decreased $16.5 million to $225.1 million at October 3, 2008 from
$241.6 million at September 28, 2007. We generated $173.7 million in cash from operations during
the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, which was offset by the retirement of $49.3 million of
Junior Notes, $62.4 million of the 2007 Convertible Notes, capital expenditures of $64.8 million
and expenditures on acquisitions of $32.6 million. The number of days sales outstanding for the
fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 decreased to 57 from 80 for fiscal 2007.

During fiscal 2008, we generated net income of $111.0 million. We experienced a decrease in
receivables and other assets of $21.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively, an increase in
accounts payable balances of $2.1 million and incurred multiple non-cash charges (e.g.,
depreciation, amortization, charge in lieu of income tax expense, contribution of common shares to
savings and retirement plans, share-based compensation expense and non-cash restructuring expense)
totaling $94.9 million. This was offset by an increase in inventories of $16.1 million, a decrease
in other accrued liabilities of $5.1 million and an increase to our deferred tax assets of $36.6
million (primarily the result of a partial release of our tax valuation allowance in fiscal 2008).

Cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, consisted of net sales
of $2.5 million in auction rate securities and investments in capital equipment of $64.8 million
primarily to expand fabrication and assembly and test capacity. We believed a focused program of
capital expenditures would have been required to sustain our manufacturing capabilities. We
expected that future capital expenditures would be funded by the generation of positive cash flows
from operations. In addition, we paid $32.6 million in cash to acquire certain assets from two
separate companies. We acquired Freescale Semiconductor’s handset power amplifier business and also
acquired patents from another company.

Cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, consisted of the
retirement of the remaining $49.3 million in Junior Notes, the retirement of $62.4 million of our
2007 Convertible Notes, and the repurchase of treasury stock of $2.1 million, offset by cash
provided by stock option exercises of $18.0 million. For additional information regarding our
borrowing arrangements, see Note 9 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our invested cash balances primarily consist of money market funds and repurchase agreements where
the underlying securities primarily consist of United States treasury obligations, United States
agency obligations, overnight repurchase agreements backed by United States treasuries and/or
United States agency obligations and highly rated commercial paper. Our invested cash balances also
include time deposits/certificates of deposit. At October 3, 2008, we also held a $3.2 million

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various
other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. To the extent actual results differ from those estimates, our
future results of operations may be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title, in accordance with
the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer. Revenue from license fees and
intellectual property is



recognized when these fees are due and payable, and all other criteria of ASC 605-

Revenue Recognition,

have been met. We ship product on consignment to certain customers and only recognize revenue when
the customer notifies us that the inventory has been consumed. Revenue recognition is deferred in all
instances where the earnings process is incomplete. Certain product sales are made to electronic component
distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and/or a right of return on unsold products.
A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or
specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

We maintain general allowances for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from
our customers’ inability to make required payments. These reserves are determined quarterly and
require management to make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by
considering factors such as historical bad debt experience, the age of the accounts receivable
balances and the impact of the current economic climate on a customer’s ability to pay. In
addition, as we become aware of any specific receivables which may be uncollectable, we perform
additional analysis and reserves are recorded if deemed necessary. Determination of such additional
specific reserves require management to make judgments and estimates pertaining to factors such as
a customer’s credit worthiness, intent and ability to pay, and overall financial position. If the
data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to
collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our
results of operations could be materially affected.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market.
Each quarter, we estimate and establish reserves for excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
These reserves are generally equal to the historical cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventory
and once recorded are considered permanent adjustments. Calculation of the reserves requires
management to use judgment and make assumptions about forecasted demand in relation to the
inventory on hand, competitiveness of our product offerings, general market conditions and product
life cycles upon which the reserves are based. When inventory on hand exceeds foreseeable demand
(generally in excess of twelve months), reserves are established for the value of such inventory
that is not expected to be sold at the time of the review.

If actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those we project, additional
inventory reserves may be required and our results of operations could be materially affected. Some
or all of the inventories that have been reserved may be retained and made available for sale,
however, they are generally scrapped over time.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company applies ASC 718-

Compensation-Stock Compensation

(“ASC 718”) which requires the
measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to
employees and directors including employee stock options, employee
stock purchases related to our  2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, restricted stock and other special equity awards based
on estimated fair values. We  adopted ASC 718 using the modified prospective transition
method, which requires the application of the applicable accounting standard as of October 1, 2005,
the first day of our  fiscal year 2006.

Share-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion
of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Share-based
compensation expense recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the
fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 only included share-based payment awards granted subsequent to
September 30, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
of ASC 718. As share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 is based on awards ultimately expected to
vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated
at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates.

Upon
adoption of ASC 718, we  elected to retain our method of valuation for share-based
awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (“Black-Scholes model”) which was also
previously used for our  pro forma information disclosure required under previous
accounting guidance. Our  determination of



fair value of share-based payment awards on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by our  stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective
variables. These variables include, but are not limited to; our expected stock price
volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise
behaviors. For more complex awards with market-based performance
conditions, we employ a
Monte Carlo simulation method which calculates many potential outcomes for an award and establishes
fair value based on the most likely outcome.

ASC 718
requires us to evaluate and periodically validate several assumptions in
conjunction with calculating share-based compensation expense. These assumptions include the
expected life of a stock option or other equity based award, expected volatility, pre-vesting
forfeiture, risk free rate and expected dividend yield. All of these assumptions affect to one
degree or another, the valuation of our equity based awards or the recognition of the
resulting share-based compensation expense. The most significant assumptions in our
calculations are described below.

Expected Life of an Option or other Equity Based Award

Since employee options are non-transferable, ASC 718 allows the use of an expected life to more
accurately estimate the value of an employee stock option rather than using the full contractual
term.

The vesting of the majority of our stock options are graded over four years (25% at each
anniversary) and the contractual term is either 7 years or
10 years. We analyzed our
historical exercise experience and exercise behavior by job group. We  analyzed the
following three exercise metrics: exercise at full vesting, exercise at midpoint in the contractual
life and exercise at the end of the full contractual term. We chose the mid-point
alternative as the estimate which most closely approximated actual
exercise experience of our
employee population. The valuation and resulting share-based compensation expense recorded is
sensitive to what alternative is chosen and the choice of another alternative in the future could
result in a material difference in the amount of share-based compensation expense recorded in a
reporting period.

Expected Volatility

Expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to
fluctuate during a period. ASC 718 does not specify a method for estimating expected volatility;
instead it provides a list of factors that should be considered when estimating volatility:
historical volatility that is generally commensurate with the expected option life, implied
volatilities, the length of time a stock has been publicly traded, regular intervals for price
observations, corporate and capital structure and the possibility of
mean reversion. We analyzed our volatility history and determined that the selection of a weighting of 50% to
historical volatility and 50% to implied volatility (as measured by examining the underlying
volatility in the open market of publicly traded call options) would provide the best estimate of
expected future volatility of the stock price. The selection of another methodology to calculate
volatility or even a different weighting between implied volatility and historical volatility could
materially impact the valuation of stock options and other equity based awards and the resulting
amount of share-based compensation expense recorded in a reporting period.

Pre-Vesting Forfeiture

ASC 718 specifies that initial accruals of share-based compensation expense should be based on the
estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is
expected to be rendered. We  examined our  options forfeiture history and computed an average annualized forfeiture
percentage. We determined that a weighted average of historical annualized forfeitures is
the best estimate of future actual forfeiture experience. The application of a different
methodology for calculating estimated forfeitures could materially impact the amount of share-based
compensation expense recorded in a reporting period.

VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Carrying values for long-lived assets and definite lived intangible assets, which exclude goodwill,
are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant. Factors considered important that
could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected,
historical or projected future operating results,



significant changes in the manner of use of
assets or our business strategy, significant negative industry or economic
trends and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time. In addition,
impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever asset / asset group values
are deemed to be unrecoverable relative to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated
by that particular asset / asset group. The determination of recoverability is based on an estimate
of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset / asset group and its
eventual disposition. Such estimates require management to exercise judgment and make assumptions
regarding factors such as future revenue streams, operating expenditures, cost allocation and asset
utilization levels, all of which collectively impact future operating performance. Our estimates of
undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, technological
changes, economic conditions, changes to our business model or changes in our operating
performance. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the
carrying value of an asset or asset group, we would recognize an impairment loss, measured as the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for
impairment in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350-

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other

(“ASC
350”)

.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise an insignificant portion of the
total book value of our goodwill and intangible assets. We assess the need to test our goodwill for
impairment on a regular basis. Pursuant to the guidance provided under ASC 280-

Segment Reporting

(“ASC 280”), we have determined that we have only one reporting unit for the purposes of allocating
and testing goodwill under ASC 350.

The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step of our impairment analysis
compares our fair value to our net book value to determine if there is an indicator of impairment.
To determine fair value, ASC 350 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies, although it
states that quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis
for measuring fair value where available. In our assessment of our fair value, we consider the
average market price of our common stock surrounding the selected testing date, the number of
shares of our common stock outstanding during such period and other marketplace activity and
related control premiums. If the calculated fair value is determined to be less than the book value
of the Company, then we perform step two of the impairment analysis. Step two of the analysis
compares the implied fair value of our goodwill, to the book value of our goodwill. If the book
value of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of our goodwill, an impairment loss is
recognized equal to that excess. In Step 2 of our annual impairment analysis, we primarily use the
income approach methodology of valuation, which includes the discounted cash flow method as well as
other generally accepted valuation methodologies, to determine the implied fair value of our
goodwill. Significant management judgment is required in preparing the forecasts of future
operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. Should step two of
the impairment test be required, the estimates we would use would be consistent with the plans and
estimates that we use to manage our business. In addition to testing goodwill for impairment on an
annual basis, factors such as unexpected adverse business conditions, deterioration of the economic
climate, unanticipated technological changes, adverse changes in the competitive environment, loss
of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, are considered by management and may signal
that our intangible assets have become impaired and result in additional interim impairment
testing.

In fiscal 2009, we performed impairment tests of our goodwill on January 3, 2009, April 4, 2009 and
on July 4, 2009. The first impairment test was triggered by a significant decline in our stock
price and deterioration in the macro-economic climate during the first fiscal quarter. The second
impairment test was triggered by a restructuring action announced on January 22, 2009 and the third
test was conducted on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, July 4, 2009, in accordance with
our regularly scheduled annual testing. The results of all three of these tests indicated that none
of our goodwill was impaired based on Step 1 of the test; accordingly Step 2 of the test was not
performed. Any management judgments and assumptions made in these tests were generally consistent
with those made in prior periods.

INCOME TAXES

We use   the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective



tax basis. This method also requires the
recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards,
to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able
to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and
assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be
required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in
additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations. We
evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the adequacy of the valuation
allowance quarterly. Likewise, in the event that we were to determine that we would be
able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an
adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of
goodwill in the period such determination was made.

The determination of recording or releasing tax valuation allowances is made, in part, pursuant to
an assessment performed by management regarding the likelihood that we will generate
future taxable income against which benefits of our deferred tax assets may or may not be realized.
This assessment requires management to exercise significant judgment and make estimates with
respect to our ability to generate revenues, gross profits, operating income and taxable
income in future periods. Amongst other factors, management must make assumptions regarding overall
business and semiconductor industry conditions, operating efficiencies, our ability to
develop products to our customers’ specifications, technological change, the competitive

environment and changes in regulatory requirements which may impact our ability to
generate taxable income and, in turn, realize the value of our deferred tax assets. In addition,
the current uncertain economic environment limits our ability to confidently forecast our
taxable income. In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, our estimates of future taxable income
were prepared in a manner consistent with our assessment of various factors, including market and
industry conditions, operating trends, product life cycles and competitive and regulatory
environments.

The calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the
application of complex tax regulations. With the implementation effective September 29, 2007, ASC
740-(“Income Taxes”) (formerly referenced as FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

), clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with
GAAP. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return.

We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other
tax jurisdictions based on our recognition threshold and measurement attribute of whether it is
more likely than not that the positions we have taken in tax filings will be sustained upon
tax audit, and the extent to which, additional taxes would be due. If payment of these amounts
ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits
being recognized in the period in which it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary.
If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge
to expense would result.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

ASC 805

In December 2007, the FASB issued amendments to ASC 805-

Business Combinations (“

ASC 805”),
which established principles and requirements for the acquirer of a business to recognize and
measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets (including in-process research and
development and defensive assets) acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree. The amendments to ASC 805 are effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Prior to the adoption of ASC 805, in-process
research and development costs were immediately expensed and acquisition costs were capitalized.
Under ASC 805 all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The standard also provides guidance
for recognizing and



measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what
information to disclose to enable
users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
combination. In April 2009 the FASB updated ASC 805 to amend the provisions for the initial
recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosures for assets and
liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. This update also eliminates the
distinction between contractual and non-contractual contingencies. The Company expects ASC 805 will
have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, but the nature and magnitude of the
specific effects will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions the Company
consummates after the October 3, 2009 effective date.

ASC 810

In December 2007, the FASB issued amendments to ASC 810-

Consolidation

(“ASC 810”). ASC 810 amends
previously issued authoritative literature to amend accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also amends
certain of consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of ASC 805. This
statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
on or after December 15, 2008. The statement shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of
the fiscal year in which the statement is initially adopted. The Company does not expect the
adoption of ASC 810 to impact its results of operations or financial position because the Company
does not have any minority interests.

ASC 820

In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC 820-

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASC 820”)

,

which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial
assets carried at fair value, and years beginning after November 15, 2008 for non-financial assets
not carried at fair value. The Company has determined that the adoption of ASC 820 will not have a
material impact on the Company’s results from operations or financial position.

ASC 825

In February 2007, the FASB issued ASC 825-

Financial Instruments

(“ASC 825”), including an
amendment of ASC 320-

Investments-Debt and Equity Securities

(“ASC 320”) , which permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not
currently required to be measured at fair value. ASC 825 is effective for the Company beginning on
October 3, 2009. The adoption of ASC 825 will not have a material impact on the Company’s results
from operations or financial position.

ASC 470-20

In May 2008, the FASB issued ASC 470-20-

Debt, Debt with Conversions and Other Options

(“ASC
470-20”). ASC 470-20 alters the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow
for either mandatory or optional cash settlements. ASC 470-20 is expected to impact the Company’s
accounting for its 2007 Convertible Notes and previously held Junior Notes. This authoritative
accounting literature requires registrants with specified convertible note features to recognize
(non-cash) interest expense based on the market rate for similar debt instruments without the
conversion feature. Furthermore, pursuant to its retrospective accounting treatment, the
accounting literature requires prior period interest expense recognition. ASC 470-20 is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2008. The Company is currently evaluating ASC 470-20 and the impact that it will have on its
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company will adopt ASC Topic 470 on October 3, 2009.

ASC 855

In May 2009, the FASB established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that
occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. This guidance was
included in the Codification under ASC 855-

Subsequent Events

(“ASC 855”), and became effective for
the Company beginning with the third fiscal



quarter of 2009. We performed an evaluation of subsequent events through November 30, 2009, and we
issued our financial statements on November 30, 2009.

ASC 105

In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™ (“Codification”) as
the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by
nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). This guidance was included in the
Codification under ASC 105-

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

(“ASC 105”). All prior
accounting standard documents were superseded by the Codification and any accounting literature not
included in the Codification is no longer authoritative. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC
issued under the authority of federal securities laws will continue to be sources of authoritative
GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification became effective for the Company beginning with the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. Therefore, beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, all
references made by the Company to GAAP in its notes to the consolidated financial statements use
the new Codification numbering system. The Codification does not change or alter existing GAAP
and, therefore, did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14

In September 2009, the FASB reached a consensus on Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”)-2009-13-

Revenue Recognition (“ASC 605”) — Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

(“ASU
2009-13”) and ASU 2009-14-

Software (“ASC 985”) — Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include
Software Elements

(“ASU 2009-14”). ASU 2009-13 modifies the requirements that must be met for an
entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple-element
arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered. ASU 2009-13 eliminates the requirement
that all undelivered elements must have either: i) VSOE or ii) third-party evidence, or TPE, before
an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement consideration that is attributable to
items that already have been delivered. In the absence of VSOE or TPE of the standalone selling
price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, entities
will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements. Overall arrangement
consideration will be allocated to each element (both delivered and undelivered items) based on
their relative selling prices, regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by VSOE or
TPE or are based on the entity’s estimated selling price. The residual method of allocating
arrangement consideration has been eliminated. ASU 2009-14 modifies the software revenue
recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and
non-software components that function together to deliver a product’s essential functionality.
These new updates are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these ASUs will have on our consolidated
financial statements.

OTHER MATTERS

Inflation did not have a material impact upon our results of operations during the three-year
period ended October 2, 2009.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are subject to foreign currency, market rate and interest risks as described below:

Investment and Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest and market risks relates principally to our investment portfolio, which as
of October 2, 2009 consisted of the following (in thousands):

Cash and cash equivalents (time deposits, overnight repurchase agreements and money market funds)

$

364,221

Restricted cash (time deposits and certificates of deposit)

5,863

Available for sale securities (auction rate securities)

2,288

$

372,372



The main objective of our investment activities is the liquidity and preservation of capital.
Credit risk associated with our investments is not significant as our investment policy prescribes
high credit quality standards and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We do
not use derivative instruments for trading, speculative or investment purposes.

In general, our cash and cash equivalent investments have short-term maturity periods which dampen
the impact of significant market or interest rate risk. We are, however, subject to overall
financial market risks, such as changes in market liquidity, credit quality and interest rates.
Available for sale securities carry a longer maturity period (contractual maturities exceed ten
years). In fiscal 2008, we experienced what we believe will be a temporary unrealized loss on our
investment in auction rate securities primarily caused by a disruption in the liquidity of the
Dutch auction process which resets interest rates each period. We classified auction rate
securities in prior periods as current assets under “Short Term Investments”. Given the failed
auctions, the auction rate securities are effectively illiquid until there is a successful auction.
Accordingly, the remaining auction rate securities balance has been reclassified to non-current
other assets. However, it is not more likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the auction
rate securities prior to maturity.

Our short-term debt consists of borrowings under our credit facility with Wachovia Bank, N.A. of
$50.0 million. Interest related to our borrowings under our credit facility with Wachovia Bank,
N.A. is at LIBOR plus 0.75% and was approximately 0.99% at October 2, 2009. Consequently, we do not
have significant cash flow exposure on this short-term debt or interest rate risk.

Our long-term debt at October 2, 2009 consists of $79.7 million aggregate principal amount of
convertible subordinated notes (“2007 Convertible Notes”), of which $32.6 million are classified in
short-term debt as current maturities. These 2007 Convertible Notes contain cash settlement
provisions, which permit the application of the treasury stock method in determining potential
share dilution of the conversion spread should the share price of the Company’s common stock exceed
$9.52. It has been the Company’s historical practice to cash settle the principal and interest
components of convertible debt instruments, and it is our intention to continue to do so in the
future, including settlement of the 2007 Convertible Notes issued in March 2007. These shares have
been included in the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009.

Exchange Rate Risk

Substantially all sales to customers and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for
pricing and payment in United States dollars, thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate
fluctuations on our results. A small percentage of our international operational expenses are
denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rate volatility could negatively or positively impact
those operating costs. For the fiscal years ended October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008, and September
28, 2007, the Company had unrealized foreign exchange gains/(losses) of $0.7 million, $(0.6)
million, and $0.4 million, respectively. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
other currencies could make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability
to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies
could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business in the future
to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Skyworks Solutions, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of October 2, 2009 and October 3, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the
years in the three-year period ended October 2, 2009. In connection with our audit of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule listed in
Item 15 of the 2009 Form 10-K. We also have audited Skyworks Solutions Inc.’s internal control
over financial reporting as of October 2, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Skyworks Solutions, Inc.’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule, and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of October 2, 2009 and October 3, 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 2, 2009, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein. Also in our opinion, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2009, based
on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Skyworks Solutions, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, (“Skyworks” or the “Company”)
is an innovator of high reliability analog and mixed signal semiconductors. Leveraging core
technologies, Skyworks offers diverse standard and custom linear products supporting automotive,
broadband, cellular infrastructure, energy management, industrial, medical, military and cellular
handset applications. The Company’s portfolio includes amplifiers, attenuators, detectors, diodes,
directional couplers, front-end modules, hybrids, infrastructure RF subsystems,
mixers/demodulators, phase shifters, PLLs/synthesizers/VCOs, power dividers/combiners, receivers,
switches and technical ceramics.

In June 2009 the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (“FASB”), established the Accounting
Standards Codification, (“ASC”), as the source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB. The
Codification is effective in the first interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009
and had no effect on the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements.

The Company has evaluated subsequent events through November 30, 2009, the date of issuance of the audited
consolidated financial statements. During this period the Company did not have any material subsequent
events.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title, in accordance with
the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer. Revenue from license fees and
intellectual property is recognized when these fees are due and payable, and all other criteria of
ASC 605-

Revenue Recognition,

have been met. The Company ships product on consignment to certain customers
and only recognize revenue when the customer notifies us that the inventory has been consumed.
Revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete. Certain
product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price
protection and/or a right of return on unsold products. A reserve for sales returns and allowances
for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event
necessitating a reserve.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

The
Company maintains general allowances for doubtful accounts for losses that they estimate will arise from
their customers’ inability to make required payments. These reserves are determined quarterly and
require management to make estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable by
considering factors such as historical bad debt experience, the age of the accounts receivable
balances and the impact of the current economic climate on a customer’s ability to pay. In
addition, as the Company becomes aware of any specific receivables which may be uncollectable, they perform
additional analysis and reserves are recorded if deemed necessary. Determination of such additional
specific reserves require management to make judgments and estimates pertaining to factors such as
a customer’s credit worthiness, intent and ability to pay, and overall financial position. If the
data the Company uses to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to
collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and its
results of operations could be materially affected.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

All majority owned subsidiaries are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and
all intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.

FISCAL YEAR

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30. Fiscal years 2009 and 2007
each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on October 2, 2009 and September 28, 2007, respectively.
Fiscal 2008 consisted of 53 weeks and ended on October 3, 2008.



USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based upon currently
available information. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The
Company’s cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds and repurchase agreements
where the underlying securities primarily consist of United States treasury obligations, United
States agency obligations, overnight repurchase agreements backed by United States treasuries
and/or United States agency obligations and highly rated commercial paper.

INVESTMENTS

The Company’s investments are classified as available for sale. These investments consist of an
auction rate security (ARS) which has long-term underlying maturities (ranging from 20 to 40
years). Due to the recent disruptions in the credit markets the Dutch auction process that normally
would allow the Company to sell the security every 28-35 days has failed since August 2007. This
investment and the auction rate security market are illiquid at this time. The Company performed a
comprehensive valuation and discounted cash flow analysis on the ARS and concluded the value of the
ARS was $2.3 million. The $2.3 million valuation from fiscal 2008 remained unchanged in fiscal year
2009. The Company will continue to closely monitor the ARS and evaluate the appropriate accounting
treatment in each reporting period.

RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash is primarily used to collateralize the Company’s obligation under a receivables
purchase agreement under which it has agreed to sell from time to time certain of its accounts
receivable to Skyworks USA, Inc. (“Skyworks USA”), a wholly-owned special purpose entity that is
fully consolidated for accounting purposes. Concurrently, Skyworks USA entered into an agreement
with Wachovia Bank, N.A. providing for a $50 million credit facility (“Facility Agreement’’)
secured by the purchased accounts receivable. For further information regarding the Facility
Agreement, please see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market.
Each quarter, the Company estimates and establishes reserves for excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory.
These reserves are generally equal to the historical cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventory
and once recorded are considered permanent adjustments. Calculation of the reserves requires
management to use judgment and make assumptions about forecasted demand in relation to the
inventory on hand, competitiveness of its product offerings, general market conditions and product
life cycles upon which the reserves are based. When inventory on hand exceeds foreseeable demand
(generally in excess of twelve months), reserves are established for
the value of such inventory that is not expected to be sold at the time of the review.

If actual
demand and market conditions are less favorable than those the
Company projects, additional
inventory reserves may be required and its results of operations could be materially affected. Some
or all of the inventories that have been reserved may be retained and made available for sale,
however, they are generally scrapped over time.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method. Significant renewals and betterments are
capitalized and equipment taken



out of service is written off. Maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of a minor amount, are
expensed as incurred.

Estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes are 5 to 30 years for buildings and
improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
over the lesser of the economic life or the life of the associated lease.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company applies ASC 718

Compensation-Stock Compensation

(“ASC 718”) which requires the
measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to
employees and directors including employee stock options, employee stock purchases related to the
Company’s 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, restricted stock and other special equity awards based
on estimated fair values. The Company adopted ASC 718 using the modified prospective transition
method, which requires the application of the applicable accounting standard as of October 1, 2005,
the first day of the Company’s fiscal year 2006.

The fair value of stock-based awards is amortized over the requisite service period, which is
defined as the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an
award. The Company uses a straight-line attribution method for all grants that
include only a service condition. Due to the existence of a market condition, certain
restricted stock grants are expensed over the service period for each separately vesting tranche.

Share-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion
of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Share-based
compensation expense recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the
fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 only included share-based payment awards granted subsequent to
September 30, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
of ASC 718. As share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 is based on awards ultimately expected to
vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated
at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates.

Upon adoption of ASC 718, the Company elected to retain its method of valuation for share-based
awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (“Black-Scholes model”) which was also
previously used for the Company’s pro forma information required under the previous authoritative
literature governing stock compensation expense. The Company’s determination of fair value of
share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model is affected by the
Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective
variables. These variables include, but are not limited to; the Company’s expected stock price
volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise
behaviors. For more complex awards with market-based performance conditions, the Company employs a
Monte Carlo simulation method which calculates many potential outcomes for an award and establishes
fair value based on the most likely outcome.

VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Carrying values for long-lived assets and definite lived intangible assets, which exclude goodwill,
are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant. Factors considered important that
could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected,
historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of
assets or the Company’s business strategy, significant negative industry or economic trends and a significant
decline in its stock price for a sustained period of time. In addition, impairment reviews are
conducted at the judgment of management whenever asset / asset group values are deemed to be
unrecoverable relative to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that
particular asset / asset group. The determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset / asset group and its eventual
disposition. Such estimates require management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding
factors such as future revenue streams, operating expenditures, cost allocation and asset
utilization levels, all of which collectively impact future operating performance. The Company’s
estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things,
technological changes, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in its
operating performance. If the sum of the



undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value of an asset or asset
group, the Company would recognize an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying
value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for
impairment in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other

(“ASC 350”)

.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise an insignificant portion of the total book
value of the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets. The Company assesses the need to test its
goodwill for impairment on a regular basis. Pursuant to the guidance provided under ASC 280-

Segment
Reporting

(“ASC 280”), the Company has determined that it has only one reporting unit for the
purposes of allocating and testing goodwill under ASC 350.

The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step of the Company’s impairment
analysis compares its fair value to its net book value to determine if there is an indicator of
impairment. To determine fair value, ASC 350 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies,
although it states that quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used
as the basis for measuring fair value where available. In the Company’s assessment of its fair
value, the Company considers the average market price of its common stock surrounding the selected
testing date, the number of shares of its common stock outstanding during such period and other
marketplace activity and related control premiums. If the calculated fair value is determined to be
less than the book value of the Company, then the Company performs step two of the impairment
analysis. Step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of the Company’s goodwill, to
the book value of its goodwill. If the book value of the Company’s goodwill exceeds the implied
fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. In Step 2 of the
Company’s annual impairment analysis, the Company primarily uses the income approach methodology of
valuation, which includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted
valuation methodologies, to determine the implied fair value of the Company’s goodwill. Significant
management judgment is required in preparing the forecasts of future operating results that are
used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. Should step two of the impairment test be
required, the estimates management would use would be consistent with the plans and estimates that
the Company uses to manage its business. In addition to testing goodwill for impairment on an
annual basis, factors such as unexpected adverse business conditions, deterioration of the economic
climate, unanticipated technological changes, adverse changes in the competitive environment, loss
of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, are considered by management and may signal
that the Company’s intangible assets have become impaired and result in additional interim
impairment testing.

In fiscal 2009, the Company performed impairment tests of its goodwill on January 3, 2009, April 4,
2009 and on July 4, 2009. The first impairment test was triggered by a significant decline in the
Company’s stock price and deterioration in the macro-economic climate during the first fiscal
quarter. The second impairment test was triggered by a restructuring action announced on January
22, 2009 and the third test was conducted on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, July 4,
2009, in accordance with the Company’s regularly scheduled annual testing. The results of all three
of these tests indicated that none of the Company’s goodwill was impaired based on Step 1 of the
test; accordingly Step 2 of the test was not performed. Any management judgments and assumptions
made in these tests were generally consistent with those made in prior periods.

DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS

Financing costs are capitalized as an asset on the Company’s balance sheet and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the financing. If debt is extinguished early, a proportionate
amount of deferred financing costs is charged to earnings.

INCOME TAXES

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. This method also requires the
recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carry forwards, to the extent that
realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured



using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

The carrying value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets assumes the Company will be able to
generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and
assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be
required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in
additional income tax expense in its consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the
realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance
quarterly. Likewise, in the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize
its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of goodwill in the period
such determination was made.

The determination of recording or releasing tax valuation allowances is made, in part, pursuant to
an assessment performed by management regarding the likelihood that the Company will generate
future taxable income against which benefits of its deferred tax assets may or may not be realized.
This assessment requires management to exercise significant judgment and make estimates with
respect to its ability to generate revenues, gross profits, operating income and taxable income in
future periods. Amongst other factors, management must make assumptions regarding overall business
and semiconductor industry conditions, operating efficiencies, the Company’s ability to develop
products to its customers’ specifications, technological change, the competitive environment and
changes in regulatory requirements which may impact its ability to generate taxable income and, in
turn, realize the value of its deferred tax assets. In addition, the current uncertain economic
environment limits the Company’s ability to confidently forecast its taxable income. In fiscal
years 2008 and 2009, the Company’s estimates of future taxable income were prepared in a manner
consistent with its assessment of various factors, including market and industry conditions,
operating trends, product life cycles and competitive and regulatory environments.

It was previously the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of all
its foreign subsidiaries in accordance with ASC 740-10,

Income Taxes

(“ASC 740-10”). During the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company reversed its policy of permanently reinvesting
the earnings of its Mexican business. For the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009, U.S. income tax
was provided on current earnings attributable to its operations in Mexico. No provision has been
made for U.S. federal, state, or additional foreign income taxes that would be due upon the actual
or deemed distribution of undistributed earnings of the other foreign subsidiaries, which have
been, or are, intended to be, permanently reinvested.

The calculation of the Company’s tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the
application of complex tax regulations. With the implementation effective September 29, 2007, ASC
740-(formerly referenced as FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

), clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP. ASC 740
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other
tax jurisdictions based on its recognition threshold and measurement attribute of whether it is
more likely than not that the positions the Company has taken in tax filings will be sustained upon
tax audit, and the extent to which, additional taxes would be due. If payment of these amounts
ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits
being recognized in the period in which it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary.
If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge
to expense would result.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.



FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term
debt and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to short-term maturities of these assets
and liabilities. Fair values of long-term debt and investments are based on quoted market prices if
available, and if not available a fair value is determined through a discounted cash flow analysis
at the date of measurement.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

The Company accounts for comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with the provisions of ASC 220-

Comprehensive Income

(“ASC 220”). ASC 220 is a financial statement presentation standard that
requires the Company to disclose non-owner changes included in equity but not included in net
income or loss. Accumulated comprehensive loss presented in the financial statements consists of
adjustments to the Company’s auction rate securities and minimum pension liability as follows (in

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

ASC 805

In December 2007, the FASB issued amendments to ASC 805-

Business Combinations(“

ASC 805”),
which established principles and requirements for the acquirer of a business to recognize and
measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets (including in-process research and
development and defensive assets) acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree. The amendments to ASC 805 are effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Prior to the adoption of ASC 805, in-process
research and development costs were immediately expensed and acquisition costs were capitalized.
Under ASC 805 all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. The standard also provides guidance
for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what
information to disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and
financial effects of the business combination. In April 2009, the FASB updated ASC 805 to amend the
provisions for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and
disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. This
update also eliminates the distinction between contractual and non-contractual contingencies. The
Company expects ASC 805 will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements, but the
nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the
acquisitions the Company consummates after the October 3, 2009 effective date.

ASC 810

In December 2007, the FASB issued amendments to ASC 810-

Consolidation

(“ASC 810”). ASC 810 amends
previously issued authoritative literature to amend accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also amends
certain of consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of ASC 805. This
statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
on or after December 15, 2008. The statement shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of
the fiscal year in which the statement is initially adopted. The Company does not expect the



adoption of ASC 810 to impact its results of operations or financial position because the Company
does not have any minority interests.

ASC 820

In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC 820-

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASC 820”)

,

which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial
assets carried at fair value, and years beginning after November 15, 2008 for non-financial assets
not carried at fair value. The Company has determined that the adoption of ASC 820 will not have a
material impact on the Company’s results from operations or financial position.

ASC 825

In February 2007, the FASB issued ASC 825-

Financial Instruments

(“ASC 825”), including an
amendment of ASC 320-

Investments-Debt and Equity Securities

(“ASC 320”) , which permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not
currently required to be measured at fair value. ASC 825 is effective for the Company beginning on
October 3, 2009. The adoption of ASC 825 will not have a material impact on the Company’s results
from operations or financial position.

ASC 470-20

In May 2008, the FASB issued ASC 470-20-

Debt, Debt with Conversions and Other Options

(“ASC
470-20”)

.

ASC 470-20 alters the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow
for either mandatory or optional cash settlements. ASC 470-20 is expected to impact the Company’s
accounting for its 2007 Convertible Notes and previously held Junior Notes. This authoritative
accounting literature requires registrants with specified convertible note features to recognize
(non-cash) interest expense based on the market rate for similar debt instruments without the
conversion feature. Furthermore, pursuant to its retrospective accounting treatment, the
accounting literature requires prior period interest expense recognition. ASC 470-20 is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2008. The Company is currently evaluating ASC 470-20 and the impact that it will have on its
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company will adopt ASC Topic 470-20 on October 3, 2009.

ASC 855

In May 2009, the FASB established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that
occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. This guidance was
included in the Codification under ASC 855-

Subsequent Events

(“ASC 855”), and became effective for
the Company beginning with the third fiscal quarter of 2009. The Company performed an evaluation of
subsequent events through November 30, 2009, and  issued its financial statements on November 30,
2009.

ASC 105

In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™ (“Codification”) as
the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by
nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). This guidance was included in the
Codification under ASC 105-

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

(“ASC 105”). All prior
accounting standard documents were superseded by the Codification and any accounting literature not
included in the Codification is no longer authoritative. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC
issued under the authority of federal securities laws will continue to be sources of authoritative
GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification became effective for the Company beginning with the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2009. Therefore, beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, all
references made by the Company to GAAP in its notes to the consolidated financial statements use
the new Codification numbering system. The Codification does not change or alter existing GAAP
and, therefore, did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14

In September 2009, the FASB reached a consensus on Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”)-2009-13-

Revenue Recognition(“ASC 605”) — Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

(“ASU
2009-13”) and ASU 2009-14-

Software(“ASC 985”) — Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include
Software Elements

(“ASU 2009-14”). ASU 2009-13 modifies the requirements that must be met for an
entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple-element
arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered. ASU 2009-13 eliminates the requirement
that all undelivered elements must have either: i) VSOE or ii) third-party evidence, or TPE, before
an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement consideration that is attributable to
items that already have been delivered. In the absence of VSOE or TPE of the standalone selling
price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, entities
will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements. Overall arrangement
consideration will be allocated to each element (both delivered and undelivered items) based on
their relative selling prices, regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by VSOE or
TPE or are based on the entity’s estimated selling price. The residual method of allocating
arrangement consideration has been eliminated. ASU 2009-14 modifies the software revenue
recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and
non-software components that function together to deliver a product’s essential functionality.
These new updates are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these ASUs will have on its consolidated
financial statements.

3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

In 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Axiom Microdevices, Inc. (“Axiom”)
and purchased certain patents from other companies for $10.4 million in cash. The purchase of Axiom
is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s future results from operations and
financial condition and therefore, proforma disclosures have been omitted.

4. MARKETABLE SECURITIES

The Company accounts for its investment in debt and equity securities in accordance with ASC
320-

Investments-Debt and Equity Securities

, and classifies them as “available for sale”. At
October 2, 2009, these securities consisted of $3.2 million in auction rate securities (“ARS”),
which are long-term debt instruments which provide liquidity through a Dutch auction process that
resets interest rates each period. The uncertainties in the credit markets have caused the ARS to
become illiquid resulting in failed auctions.

During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, the Company performed a comprehensive valuation and
discounted cash flow analysis on the ARS. The Company concluded the value of the ARS was $2.3
million thus the carrying value of these securities was reduced by $0.9 million, reflecting this
change in fair value. The Company assessed the decline in fair value to be temporary and recorded
this reduction in shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company will
continue to closely monitor the ARS and evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment in each
reporting period. The Company holds no other auction rate securities.

5. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

On October 4, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820-

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure

(“ASC 820”).
In accordance with ASC 820-10-55, the Company has deferred the adoption of ASC 820 for
non-financial assets and liabilities including intangible assets and reporting units measured at
fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test. The Company will adopt the remainder
of ASC 820 on October 3, 2009. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company groups its financial assets
and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in three levels, based on the markets
in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to
determine fair value. These levels are:

•

Level 1 — Valuation is based upon quoted market price for identical
instruments traded in active markets.

•

Level 2 — Valuation is based on quoted market prices for similar
instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation



techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the
market.

•

Level 3 — Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use
significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation
techniques include use of discounted cash flow models and similar
techniques.

Under ASC 820, the Company groups marketable securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the
assumptions used to determine fair value.

The Company has cash equivalents classified as Level 1 and has no Level 2 securities. The
marketable securities classified as Level 3 are auction rate securities.

fair value on a recurring basis as of October 2, 2009 (in thousands):

In 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Axiom and purchased certain patents from other companies for $10.4 million in cash. This
resulted in the allocation of approximately $6.4 million to goodwill. The purchase of Axiom is not
expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s future results from operations and financial
condition.

In October 2007, the Company paid $32.6 million in cash to acquire certain assets from two separate
companies resulting in the allocation of approximately $13.8 million to goodwill.

Goodwill is adjusted as required as a result of the realization of deferred tax assets. The benefit
from the recognition of a portion of these deferred items reduces the carrying value of goodwill
instead of reducing income tax expense. Accordingly, future realization of certain deferred tax
assets will reduce the carrying value of goodwill. For the fiscal years ended October 2,
2009, October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007, goodwill was reduced by $7.2



million, $11.0 million,
and $12.5 million, respectively. The remaining deferred tax assets that could reduce goodwill in
future periods are $0.4 million as of October 2, 2009.

The Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of its fourth fiscal
quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of
goodwill may be impaired. In accordance with ASC350,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,

the Company
performed a goodwill impairment test and determined that as of July 4, 2009, its goodwill was not
impaired.

On March 2, 2007, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible
subordinated notes (“2007 Convertible Notes”). The offering contained two tranches. The first
tranche consisted of $100.0 million of 1.25% convertible subordinated notes due March 2010. The
second tranche consisted of $100.0 million of 1.50% convertible subordinated notes due March 2012.
The conversion price of the 2007 Convertible Notes is 105.0696 shares per $1,000 principal amount
of notes to be redeemed, which is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately $9.52 per
share, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the conversion date. Holders may require the
Company to repurchase the 2007 Convertible Notes upon a change in control of the Company. The
Company pays interest in cash semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. It
has been the Company’s historical practice to cash settle the principal and interest components of
convertible debt instruments, and it is its intention to continue to do so in the future, including
settlement of the 2007 Convertible Notes.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company redeemed $40.5 million of principal amount of
the 1.50% convertible subordinated notes at an average price of 92.6% of par value. A discount of
approximately $2.9 million offset by approximately $0.9 million in deferred financing costs was
recorded as a gain during the period. The Company also redeemed $17.4 million of principal amount
of the 1.25% convertible subordinated notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. A premium
of approximately $6.0 million, along with approximately $0.1 million in deferred financing costs
was recorded as a charge against earnings.

During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, the Company redeemed $50.0 million and $12.4 million
in aggregate principal amount of the 1.25% and 1.50% convertible subordinated notes, respectively,
at an average price of 109.0% of par value. A premium of approximately $5.8 million, along with
approximately $1.0 million in deferred financing costs was recorded as a charge against earnings in
fiscal 2008.

On December 21, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASC 825,

Financial
Instruments

(“ASC 825”). ASC 825 specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments,
or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement, should be separately
recognized and measured in accordance with ASC 450,

Contingencies

. The Company adopted ASC 825 on
September 29, 2007. The Company agreed to file a shelf registration statement under the Securities
Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) not later than 120 days after the first date of original
issuance of the 2007 Convertible Notes. The Company agreed to utilize commercially reasonable
efforts to have this shelf registration statement declared effective not later than 180 days after
the first date of original issuance of the notes, and to keep it effective until the earliest of:
1) two years from the



effective date of the shelf registration statement; 2) the date when all
registrable securities have been registered under the Securities Act and disposed of; and 3) the
date on which all registrable securities held by non-affiliates are eligible to be sold to the
public pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act. The Company filed the shelf
registration statement within 120 days of the original issuance of the 2007 Convertible Notes and
the shelf registration statement was declared effective within 180 days after the first date of
original issuance of the notes. If the shelf registration statement ceases to be effective within
two years from the effective date of the shelf registration statement the Company will be obligated
to pay an additional 0.25% interest per annum for the first 90 days after the occurrence of the
registration default and at the rate of 0.50% per annum thereafter. The Company has concluded that
it is not probable that a contingent liability has been incurred at October 2, 2009 pursuant to the
application of ASC 450 and thus has not recorded a liability.

(“Skyworks USA”), a wholly-owned special purpose entity that is consolidated for accounting
purposes. Concurrently, Skyworks USA entered into an agreement with Wachovia Bank, N.A. providing
for a $50.0 million credit facility (“Facility Agreement’’) secured by the purchased accounts
receivable. As a part of the consolidation, any interest incurred by Skyworks USA related to monies
it borrows under the Facility Agreement is recorded as interest expense in the Company’s results of
operations. The Company performs collections and administrative functions on behalf of Skyworks
USA. The Company renewed the Facility Agreement on July 9, 2009 for a one year term. Interest
related to the Facility Agreement is at LIBOR plus 0.75%. As of October 2, 2009, Skyworks USA had
borrowed $50.0 million under this agreement.

During the fiscal years ended October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008 and September 28, 2007, the
valuation allowance was reduced by $12.8 million, including $5.6 million related to acquired Axiom
deferred tax assets, $11.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively, resulting from the partial
recognition of certain acquired tax benefits that were subject to a valuation allowance at the time
of acquisition, the realization of which required a reduction of goodwill. Of this amount, $0.0
million, $7.0 million and $0.0 million is included in the charge in lieu of tax expense in the
table above for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, and $12.8 million, $4.0

In accordance with GAAP, management has determined that it is more likely than not that a portion
of its historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized. As of October 2, 2009,
the Company has maintained a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $26.6 million,
principally related to state research tax credits that management has determined is more likely
than not that it will not be realized. The net change in the valuation allowance of $56.3 million
during fiscal 2009 is principally due to the recognition of tax benefits offset against current
year taxable income of $85.7 million and a reduction in the end of year valuation allowance of
$40.9 million based on the Company’s assessment of the amount of deferred tax assets that are realizable on a
more likely than not basis. When recognized, the tax benefits relating to any future reversal of
the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at October 2, 2009 will be accounted for as follows:
approximately $22.3 million will be recognized as an income tax benefit, $0.4 million will be
recognized as a reduction to goodwill and $3.9 million will be recognized as an increase to
shareholders’ equity for certain tax deductions from employee stock options.

Based on the Company’s evaluation of the realizability of its United States net deferred tax assets
and other future deductible items through the generation of future taxable income, $40.9 million of
the Company’s valuation allowance was reversed at October 2, 2009. The amount reversed consisted of
$27.7 million recognized as income tax benefit, and $13.2 million recognized as a reduction to
goodwill. Deferred tax assets have been recognized for foreign operations when management believes
they will more likely than not be recovered during the carryforward period. The Company will continue to
assess its valuation allowance in future periods.

As of October 2, 2009, the Company has United States federal net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $71.1 million, which will expire at various dates through 2028 and aggregate state
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.3 million, which will expire at various dates
through 2018. The Company also has United States federal and state income tax credit carryforwards
of approximately $64.3 million. The United States federal tax credits expire at various dates
through 2029. The state tax credits relate primarily to California research tax credits which can
be carried forward indefinitely.



No provision has been made for United States federal, state, or additional foreign income taxes
related to approximately $4.9 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have
been or are intended to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the United
States federal income tax liability, if any, which would be payable if such earnings were not
permanently reinvested.

The Company adopted ASC 740-

Income Taxes

-(formerly referenced as FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

) as of the
beginning of fiscal year 2008. As of October 3, 2008, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits
totaled $7.9 million. As of October 2, 2009, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled
$8.9 million. Included in this amount is $6.5 million which would impact the effective tax rate,
if recognized. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate, if
recognized, due to the Company’s valuation allowance. There are no positions which the Company anticipates
could change within the next twelve months.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as

The Company’s major tax jurisdictions as of October 2, 2009 are the U.S., California, and Iowa. For
the U.S., the Company has open tax years dating back to fiscal year 1998 due to the carryforward of
tax attributes. For California, the Company has open tax years dating back to fiscal year 2002 due
to the carryforward of tax attributes. For Iowa, the Company has open tax years dating back to
fiscal year 2002 due to the carryforward of tax attributes.

During the year ended October 2, 2009, there was no significant recognition of previously
unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of the statute of limitations period. Total
year-to-date accrued interest related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits was $0.0 million.

11. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

COMMON STOCK

The Company is authorized to issue (1) 525,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.25 per
share, and (2) 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value.

Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by the
Company’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. Dividends may not be
paid on common stock unless all accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, have been paid or
declared and set aside. In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the
holders of common stock will be entitled to share pro rata in the assets remaining after payment to
creditors and after payment of the liquidation preference plus any unpaid dividends to holders of
any outstanding preferred stock.

Each holder of the Company’s common stock is entitled to one vote for each such share outstanding
in the holder’s name. No holder of common stock is entitled to cumulate votes in voting for
directors. The Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that,

Share-based compensation for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 and October 3, 2008 includes
approximately $2.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively, related to the portions of fiscal 2009
and fiscal 2008 short-term management incentive compensation that exceeded target metrics which
were paid in common stock after year end. The Company anticipates an immaterial amount of share
dilution as a result of this arrangement.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company maintains a domestic and an international employee stock purchase plan. Under these
plans, eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of
compensation. The price per share is the lower of 85% of the market price at the beginning or end
of each offering period (generally six months). The plans provide for purchases by employees of up
to an aggregate of 8.1 million shares through December 31, 2012. Shares of common stock purchased
under these plans in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 were 1,058,736, 790,556, and 830,103,
respectively. At October 2, 2009, there are 1.6 million shares available for purchase. The Company
recognized compensation expense of $1.6 million for both the fiscal years ended October 2, 2009 and
October 3, 2008, and $1.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007.

Employee and Director Stock Option Plans

The Company has share-based compensation plans under which employees and directors may be granted
options to purchase common stock. Options are generally granted with exercise prices at not less
than the fair market value on the grant date, generally vest over 4 years and expire 7 or 10 years
after the grant date. As of October 2, 2009, a total of 83.1 million shares are authorized for
grant under the Company’s share-based compensation plans, with 18.4 million options outstanding.
The number of common shares reserved for granting of future awards to employees and directors under
these plans was 15.0 million at October 2, 2009. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense on
stock options at October 2, 2009 was $16.0 million, and the weighted average period over which the
cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 2.2 years.

As of
October 2, 2009, the Company had 10 equity compensation plans under which its equity
securities were authorized for issuance to its employees and/or directors:



Except for the 1999 Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Washington Sub, Inc. 2002 Stock Option
Plan and the Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan, each of the foregoing equity compensation
plans was approved by the Company’s  stockholders. The 1999 Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan expired on April
26, 2009.

Restricted Stock Awards Issued in connection with the Fiscal Year 2008 Management Incentive Plan

The Company issued 238,706 shares of common stock in fiscal year 2009 to certain key employees
based on the Company’s exceeding target metrics under the fiscal year 2008 Management Incentive
Plan. The Company recorded $1.7 million in expense during fiscal year 2008 as a result of this performance.

Restricted Stock Awards with Service Conditions

The Company’s share-based compensation plans provide for awards of restricted shares of common
stock and other stock-based incentive awards to officers, other employees and certain
non-employees. Restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates during
the prescribed retention period (generally within four years of the date of award).

The Company granted 10,000, 50,000, and 38,000 shares of restricted stock in the fiscal years ended
October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007, respectively, with a four year graded
vesting. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense on restricted stock with service
conditions outstanding at October 2, 2009 was $0.4 million, and the weighted average period over
which the cost is expected to be recognized is 2.9 years.

The Company also granted 37,500 shares of restricted stock during the fiscal year ended October 2,
2009 that will vest over a two-year period (100% at the end of year 2). The remaining unrecognized
compensation expense on restricted stock with service conditions outstanding at October 2, 2009 was
$0.1 million, and the weighted average period over which the cost is expected to be recognized is
approximately 1.7 years.

In addition, during both the fiscal years ended October 2, 2009, and October 3, 2008, under the
2008 Director Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company issued a total of 100,000 restricted stock
awards to Directors with a three-year graded vesting. The remaining unrecognized compensation
expense on restricted stock with service conditions outstanding at October 2, 2009 was $1.0
million. The weighted average period over which the cost is expected to be recognized is
approximately 2.4 years.

Restricted Stock Awards with Market Conditions and Service Conditions

The Company granted 576,688 and 606,488 shares of restricted stock during the fiscal years ended
October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007, respectively, with service and market conditions on
vesting. If the restricted stock recipient meets the service condition but not the market condition
in years 1, 2, 3 and 4, then the restricted stock vests 0% at the end of year 1, 33.3% at the end
of year 2, 33.3% at the end of year 3 and 33.3% at the end of year 4. The market condition allows
for accelerated vesting of the award as of the first, second and if not previously accelerated, the
third anniversaries of the grant date. Specifically, if the Company’s stock performance meets or
exceeds the 60

th

percentile of its selected peer group for the years ended on each of the first three anniversaries
of the grant date, then 33.3% of the award vests upon each anniversary (up to 100%). The Company
calculated a derived service period of



approximately 3.0 years using a Monte-Carlo simulation to simulate a range of possible future stock
prices for the Company and the members of the Company’s selected peer group.

The remaining unrecognized compensation expense on restricted stock with market and service
conditions outstanding at October 2, 2009 was $0.6 million. This cost is expected to be recognized
during the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

Performance Units with Milestone-Based Performance Conditions

The Company granted 56,000, 160,500, and 223,200 performance units with milestone-based performance
conditions to non-executives during the fiscal years ended October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008, and
September 28, 2007, respectively. The performance units will convert to common stock at such time
that the performance conditions are deemed to be achieved. The performance units will be expensed
over implicit performance periods ranging from 11-34 months. The Company will utilize both
quantitative and qualitative criteria to judge whether the milestones are probable of achievement.
If the milestones are deemed to be not probable of achievement, no expense will be recognized until
such time as they become probable of achievement. If a milestone is initially deemed probable of
achievement and subsequent to that date it is deemed to be not probable of achievement, the Company
will discontinue recording expense on the units. If the milestone is deemed to be improbable of
achievement, any expense recorded on those performance units will be reversed. As of the fiscal
year ended October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007, the fair value of the
performance units at the date of grant were $0.6 million, $1.4 million, and $1.5 million,
respectively. The
Company issued 30,419 shares, 100,466 shares, and 103,688 shares in fiscal 2009, 2008, and
fiscal 2007, respectively as a result of milestone achievement. In addition, certain other
milestones were deemed to be probable of achievement thus, the
Company recorded total compensation expense
of $(0.1) million, $1.2 million, and $0.7 million in the fiscal years ended October 2, 2009,
October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007, respectively.

Executive Performance Share Awards

The Company awarded 725,000 performance shares based on future stock price appreciation to
executives during the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008. Each
executive had the ability to earn
Nominal (50% of Target), Target, Stretch (150% of Target), or no shares depending on performance
within a three year period. On November 6, 2007, a base price was set (based on the trailing 60
day average stock price) and stock price hurdles were set (based on appreciation of 20%, 40% and
60% of the base price). Actual performance would have been measured using a rolling 60 day average and shares
would have been locked in when Skyworks met or exceeded a stock price hurdle.
Shares were not cumulative and
each targeted stock price was a “hurdle” (there was no interpolation for performance between
hurdles). Locked in shares would have been delivered to the executive at the end of the three year period
as long as the executive was actively employed. If the Nominal stock
price hurdle (1st Hurdle) was
not met or exceeded by the end of the three year period then the
shares would have expired. If a change of
control had occured within the three year performance period then the
executive would have received the higher
of the actual amount earned (locked in) or Target (the last day of
the 60 day average would have included
the closing price on the date of the transaction)

.

As of the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, the
fair value of the performance units at the date of grant was
$7.5 million. These awards were
forfeited by the executives on June 9, 2009 and replaced with the 2009 Executive Restricted Stock
and Performance Share Awards as described below.

Executive Restricted Stock and Performance Share Awards

On June 4, 2009, the Company gave its executives the opportunity to forfeit the aforementioned
performance shares that were valued on November 6, 2007 and the executives received in its place a
modified award with both a restricted stock component and performance share component. On June 10,
2009, the Company modified the November 6, 2007 performance shares by issuing 337,500 restricted
stock awards based on a service condition. These restricted shares will cliff
vest on November 6, 2010 provided the executive continues employment with the Company through such
date. The performance share award component can be earned by the executive if the
following conditions are met: The target relative stock price condition shall be deemed met on
November 6, 2010 if the percentage change in the price of the Company’s stock price exceeds the

th

percentile of a peer group as selected by the Company’s compensation committee.
Should such condition be met the executive will be issued an additional 337,500 shares of common
stock (50% on November 6, 2010 and 50% on November 6, 2011
should the executive continue
employment with the Company through such dates). The stretch relative stock price condition shall be
deemed met on November 6, 2010 if the percentage change in the price of the



Company’s stock price exceeds the 70

th

percentile of a peer group as selected by the
Company’s compensation committee. Should such condition be met the executive will be granted an
additional 337,500 shares of common stock (50% on November 6,
2010 and 50% on November 6, 2011
should the executive continue employment with the Company through
such dates). The measurement
period for both the aforementioned target relative stock price condition and the stretch stock
price condition was deemed to have started on November 6, 2007, and will end on November 6, 2010.
Compensation expense of $4.7 million has been recorded ratably between November 6, 2007 and the
fiscal year ended October 2, 2009. The amount of additional compensation expense that will be
recorded as a result of the modification of the November 6, 2007 performance share awards and the
replacement of those awards with the 2009 Executive Restricted Stock
and Performance Share Awards
will be $1.7 million (assuming all service and performance conditions are achieved).

2009 Operating Margin Performance Awards

The Company awarded 846,456 performance shares to executives and key employees based on operating
margin performance for fiscal year 2009. Each participant has the ability to earn Minimum (50% of
Target), Target, Stretch, or Maximum (200% of Target), depending on performance as publicly
announced by the Company following the fiscal year end. Upon achievement of the performance target,
the participants will earn the corresponding number of shares issued as follows: One-third on the
initial issuance date anniversary of November 4, 2009 and one-third on each of the second and third
anniversary of the initial issuance date, providing the employee is actively employed. As of the
fiscal year ended October 2, 2009, the fair value of the performance units at the date of grant was
$6.7 million. At October 2, 2009, the Company had recorded total compensation expense of $2.7
million.

Share-Based Compensation Plans for Director

The Company has four share-based compensation plans under which options and restricted stock have
been granted for non-employee directors — the 1994 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, the 1997
Directors’ Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, the Directors’ 2001 Stock Option Plan, and the 2008
Directors’ Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the four plans, a total of 2.2 million shares have been
authorized for option grants. Under the current 2008 Directors’ Long-Term Incentive Plan, a total
of 0.4 million shares are available for new grants as of October 2, 2009. The 2008 Directors’
Long-Term Incentive Plan is structured to provide options and restricted common stock to
non-employee directors as follows: a new director receives a total of 25,000 options and 12,500
shares of restricted common stock upon becoming a member of the Board; and continuing directors
receive 12,500 shares of restricted common stock after each Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Under
this plan, the option price is the fair market value at the time the option is granted. All options
granted are exercisable at 25% per year beginning one year from the date of grant. The maximum
contractual term of the director plans is 10 years (excluding the 2008 Directors’ Long-Term
Incentive Plan which has a maximum contractual term of 7 years). As of October 2, 2009, a total of
0.8 million options at a weighted average exercise price of $9.89 per share were outstanding under
these four plans, and 0.7 million options were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of
$10.40 per share. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense on director stock options at
October 2, 2009 was $0.2 million and the weighted average period over which the cost is expected to
be recognized is approximately 1.1 years. There were 105,000 options exercised under these plans
during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009, and 60,000 options exercised under these plans during
both the fiscal years ended October 3, 2008 and September 28, 2007. The above-mentioned activity
for the share-based compensation plans for directors is included in the option tables below.

The Company used an arithmetic average of historical volatility and implied volatility to calculate
its expected volatility during the year ended October 2, 2009. Historical volatility was determined
by calculating the mean reversion of the weekly-adjusted closing stock price over the 6.36 years
between June 25, 2002 and November 4, 2008. The implied volatility was calculated by analyzing the
52-week minimum and maximum prices of publicly traded call options on the Company’s common stock.
The Company concluded that an arithmetic average of these two calculations provided for the most
reasonable estimate of expected volatility under the guidance of ASC 718.

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed Treasury bill interest rates
(risk free) appropriate for the expected life of the Company’s employee stock options.

The expected life of employee stock options represents a calculation based upon the historical
exercise, cancellation and forfeiture experience for the Company over the 6.25 years between June
25, 2002 and October 3, 2008. The Company deemed that exercise, cancellation and forfeiture
experience in 2008 was consistent with historical norms thus expected life was not recalculated at
October 2, 2009. The Company determined that it had two populations with unique exercise behavior.
These populations included stock options with a contractual life of 7 years and 10 years,
respectively.



As share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the
fiscal years ended October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007 is actually based on
awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for annualized estimated forfeitures of
11.10%, 11.79%, and 12.85%, respectively. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time
of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.

12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN, PENSIONS AND OTHER RETIREE BENEFITS

The Company maintains a 401(k) plan covering substantially all of its employees. All of the
Company’s employees who are at least 21 years old are eligible to receive discretionary Company
contributions under the 401(k) plan. Discretionary Company contributions are determined by the
Board of Directors and may be in the form of cash or the Company’s stock. The Company has generally
contributed a match of up to 4.0% of an employee’s annual eligible compensation. For the fiscal
years ended October 2, 2009, October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007, the Company contributed and
recognized expense for 0.7 million, 0.6 million, and 0.7 million shares, respectively, of the
Company’s common stock valued at $4.6 million, $5.0 million, and $4.8 million, respectively, to
fund the Company’s obligation under the 401(k) plan.

In fiscal 2008, the Company began phasing out its funding of retiree medical benefits. On
September 18, 2007, a letter was mailed to the participants of the Retiree Health Plan informing
them of the Company’s plan to phase out the Plan over a three year period effective January 2008.
Skyworks contributions will be phased out on the following basis:

The Company incurred net periodic benefit costs of $0.2 million for pension benefits during the
fiscal year ended October 2, 2009, and $0.1 million for pension benefits in each of the fiscal
years ending October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007, respectively.

The Company realized a credit of $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2009 related to
the curtailment of the retiree medical benefits health plan, and incurred net periodic benefit cost
of $0.1 million in each of the fiscal years ending October 3, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively.



The Company adopted ASC 715-

Compensation-Retirement Benefits

(“ASC 715”) on
September 28, 2007, on the required prospective basis. In accordance with ASC 715,
the funded status as of September 28, 2007, is recorded as a liability in the accompanying

The Company is attempting to sublet certain properties that were vacated upon the exit of the
baseband product area and, if successful, future operating lease commitments will be partially
offset by proceeds received from the subleases.

In addition, the Company has entered into licensing agreements for intellectual property rights and
maintenance and support services. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company is
committed to making aggregate payments of $4.2 million, $3.4 million, $1.5 million, and $0.6
million in fiscal years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

14. CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been, and may in the future be,
instituted or asserted against the Company, including those pertaining to patent infringement,
intellectual property, environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment and
contractual matters.

Additionally, the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of
intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future
assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are
important to our business and have demanded and may in the future
demand that the Company  license their
technology. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims
or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company. Intellectual property disputes often
have a risk of injunctive relief, which, if imposed against the Company, could materially and
adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, or results of operations.

From time
to time the Company is   involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The Company
believes that there is no such ordinary course litigation pending that will have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its  business.



15. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES

The Company has no guarantees. The Company generally indemnifies its customers from third-party
intellectual property infringement litigation claims related to its products, and, on occasion,
also provides other indemnities related to product sales. In connection with certain facility
leases, the Company has indemnified its lessors for certain claims arising from the facility or the
lease.

The Company indemnifies its directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws
of the state of Delaware. The duration of the indemnities varies, and in many cases is indefinite.
The indemnities to customers in connection with product sales generally are subject to limits based
upon the amount of the related product sales and in many cases are subject to geographic and other
restrictions. In certain instances, the Company’s indemnities do not provide for any limitation of
the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. The Company has not
recorded any liability for these indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

2009 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER

On
January 22, 2009, the Company implemented a restructuring plan
to realign its  costs given current
business conditions.
The Company exited its  mobile transceiver product area and reduced global headcount by approximately 4%, or
150 employees which resulted in a reduction to annual operating expenditures of approximately $20
million. The Company recorded various charges associated with this
action. In total, they  recorded $16.0
million of restructuring and other charges and $3.5 million in inventory write-downs that were
charged to cost of goods sold.

The $16.0 million charge includes the following: $4.5 million related to severance and benefits,
$5.6 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived
assets which were written down to their salvage values, $2.1 million related to the
exit of certain operating leases, $2.3 million related to the impairment of technology licenses and
design software, and $1.5 million related to other charges. These charges total $16.0 million and
are recorded in restructuring and other charges.

The Company made cash payments related to the restructuring plan of $5.9 million during the fiscal
year ended October 2, 2009.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of equity based
awards using the treasury stock method, the Junior Notes on an if-converted basis, and the 2007
Convertible Notes using the treasury stock method, if their effect is dilutive.

Equity based awards exercisable for approximately 16.5 million shares and 23.0 million shares were
outstanding but not included in the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal year ended
October 2, 2009 and October 3, 2008, respectively, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Junior Notes convertible into approximately 5.5 million shares and equity based awards exercisable
for approximately 19.3 million shares were outstanding but not included in the computation of
earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007 as their effect would have been
anti-dilutive. If the Company had earned at least $78.8 million in net income for the fiscal year
ended September 28, 2007 the Junior Notes would have been dilutive to earnings per share.

In addition, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible
subordinated notes (“2007 Convertible Notes”) in March 2007. These 2007 Convertible Notes contain
cash settlement provisions, which permit the application of the treasury stock method in
determining potential share dilution of the conversion spread should the share price of the
Company’s common stock exceed $9.52. It has been the Company’s historical practice to cash settle
the principal and interest components of convertible debt
instruments, and it is the Company’s  intention to
continue to do so in the future, including settlement of the 2007 Convertible Notes issued in March
2007. These shares have not been included in the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal
year ended October 3, 2008 or September 28, 2007 as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

18. SEGMENT INFORMATION AND CONCENTRATIONS

In accordance with ASC 280-

Segment Reporting

(“ASC 280”), the Company has one reportable operating
segment which designs, develops, manufactures and markets proprietary semiconductor products,
including intellectual property, for manufacturers of wireless communication products. ASC 280
establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating
segments in annual financial statements and in interim reports to shareholders. The method for
determining what information to report is based on management’s organization of segments within the
Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. In evaluating
financial performance, management uses sales and operating profit as the measure of the segments’
profit or loss. All of the Company’s operating segments share similar economic characteristics as
they have a similar long term business model, and have similar research and development expenses
and similar selling, general and administrative expenses, thus, the Company has concluded at
October 2, 2009 that it has only one reportable operating segment. The Company will re-assess its
conclusions at least annually.

region. For example, if the Company sells a power amplifier module to a customer in South Korea,
the sale is recorded within the South Korea account although that customer, in turn, may integrate
that module into a product sold to a service provider (its customer) in Africa, China, Europe, the
Middle East, the Americas, or within South Korea.

the plan were $19.4 million. Due to accounting classifications, the charges associated with
the plan are recorded in various lines and are summarized as follows: Cost of goods sold
adjustments include approximately $3.5 million of inventory write-downs. Restructuring and
other charges primarily consisted of $4.5 million related to severance and benefits, $5.6
million related to the impairment of long-lived assets, $2.0 million related to lease
obligations, $2.3 million related to the impairment of technology licenses and design software
and $1.5 million related to other charges.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 2, 2009. The
term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on management’s
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 2, 2009, our chief executive
officer and chief



financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting.

No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter
ended October 2, 2009 that have
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Skyworks’ internal control over
financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of October 2, 2009. In making this assessment, the Company’s management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on their assessment, management concluded that, as of October 2, 2009, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on
page 48.
