ITEM 1.         BUSINESS

SUMMARY

Skyworks Solutions, Inc.
(“Skyworks” or the “Company”) is a leading wireless semiconductor
company focused exclusively on radio frequency (“RF”) and complete cellular
system solutions for mobile communications applications. We offer front-end modules, RF
subsystems and cellular systems to leading wireless handset and infrastructure customers.

From the power amplifier, through the
radio and to the baseband, we have developed one of the industry’s broadest product
portfolios including leadership switches and power amplifier modules. Additionally, we
offer a highly integrated direct conversion transceiver and have launched a comprehensive
cellular system for next generation handsets.

With our extensive product portfolio
and significant systems-level expertise, Skyworks is the ideal partner for both top-tier
wireless manufacturers and new market entrants who demand simplified architectures, faster
development cycles and fewer overall suppliers.

Skyworks was formed through the
merger (“Merger”) of the wireless business of Conexant Systems, Inc.
(“Conexant”) and Alpha Industries, Inc. (“Alpha”) on June 25, 2002,
pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of December 16, 2001, as
amended as of April 12, 2002, by and among Alpha, Conexant and Washington Sub, Inc.
(“Washington”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Conexant to which Conexant spun off
its wireless communications business. Immediately following the Merger, the Company
purchased Conexant’s semiconductor assembly and test facility located in Mexicali,
Mexico and certain related operations (the “Mexicali Operations”). For purposes
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Washington business and the Mexicali Operations
are collectively referred to as Washington/Mexicali. Shortly thereafter, Alpha changed its
corporate name to Skyworks Solutions, Inc. We are headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts,
and have executive offices in Irvine, California. We have design, engineering,
manufacturing, marketing, sales and service facilities throughout North America, Europe,
and the Asia/Pacific region. Our Internet address is www.skyworksinc.com. We make
available on our Internet website free of charge our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Section 16 filings on Forms 3, 4 and 5,
and amendments to those reports as soon as practicable after we electronically file such
material with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The information
contained in our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

We believe that the wireless industry
is on the verge of another growth cycle. Traditional voice services offered by wireless
carriers are being rapidly supplemented or augmented by the emergence of the
next-generation wireless technologies and WiFi-based (802.11) wireless data applications.
All of these new technologies are geared to make high-speed wireless data available on
handset, PDA, notebook and other platforms in a variety of environments.

The cellular handset market has grown
significantly over the past five years despite the broad technology slowdown in 2001 and
2002. According to market research firm ARC Group, handset sales have increased by
approximately 75% from 1999 to 2003 with volume reaching 483 million units in 2003.
Exiting 2003, the worldwide penetration rate of wireless services was at 22% according to
market research firm EMC, and is expected to climb to 33% by 2006. This increased
penetration implies that approximately 750 million new subscribers will begin using
wireless services over the next three years, approaching the 2.1 billion worldwide
subscriber mark in 2006 — roughly a third of the world’s population.

In parallel, handset growth is being
driven by replacement units purchased by existing subscribers as carriers introduce
updated models, smaller form factors, added features and new multimedia applications. In
particular, camera phones and multimedia services are expected to be two major growth
drivers in the coming years. According to the ARC Group, color-display phones have become
the new standard and majority of new products being introduced incorporate this
functionality. Meanwhile, handsets with built-in cameras are forecasted to increase from
59 million units in 2003 to almost 330 million units by 2006. These new wireless phones
will also feature higher data rate services driven by 2.5G and 3G standards such as GPRS,
CDMA 2000, EDGE and WCDMA. According to ARC Group, the combination of new subscriber
additions and higher replacement rates is expected to drive total handset sales from 483
million units in 2003 to approximately 670 million units in 2006.

In response to this rapidly growing
market, handset original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, are significantly shortening
product development cycles, seeking simplified architectures and streamlining
manufacturing processes. Traditional OEMs are shifting to low-cost suppliers around the
world. In turn, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and contract manufacturers, who
lack RF and systems-level expertise, are entering the high-volume mobile phone market to
support OEMs as well as to develop handset platforms of their own. ODMs and contract
manufacturers seek to manage low-cost handset manufacturing and assembly, freeing OEMs to
focus on marketing and distribution aspects of their business. Established handset
manufacturers and new market entrants alike are demanding complete semiconductor system
solutions that include the RF system, all baseband processing, protocol stack and user
interface software, plus comprehensive reference designs and development platforms. With
these solutions, traditional handset OEMs can accelerate time-to-market cycles with lower
investments in engineering and system design. These solutions also enable ODMs to enter
the high volume handset market without requiring significant investments in RF and
systems-level expertise.

Similarly, cellular and personal
communications services network operators are developing and deploying next-generation
services. These service providers are incorporating packet-switching capability in their
networks to deliver data communications and Internet access to digital cellular and other
wireless devices. Over the long term, service providers are seeking to establish a global
network that can be accessed by subscribers at any time, anywhere in the world and that
can provide subscribers with multimedia services. To meet this goal, OEMs that supply
wireless infrastructure base stations to network operators are increasingly relying on
mobile communications semiconductor suppliers that can provide highly integrated RF and
mixed signal processing functionality.

Additionally, as service providers
migrate cellular subscribers to data intensive next-generation applications, base stations
that transmit and receive signals in the backbone of cellular and personal communications
services systems will be under further capacity constraints. To meet the related demand,
OEMs will be challenged to increase base station transceiver performance and
functionality, while reducing size, power consumption and overall system costs.

We believe that these market trends
create a potentially significant opportunity for a broad-based wireless semiconductor
supplier with a comprehensive product portfolio supported by specialized wireless
manufacturing process technologies and a full range of systems-level expertise.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Skyworks is a leading wireless
semiconductor company focused exclusively on RF and complete cellular system solutions for

OUR STRATEGY

Skyworks’ vision is to become
the premier supplier of wireless semiconductor solutions. Key elements in our strategy
include:

Leveraging Core
Technologies

Skyworks deploys technology building
blocks such as radio frequency integrated circuits, analog/mixed-signal processing cores
and digital baseband engines as well as software across multiple product platforms. We
believe that this approach creates economies of scale in research and development and
facilitates a reduction in the time to market for key products.

Increasing Integration
Levels

High levels of integration enhance
the benefits of our products by reducing production costs through the use of fewer
external components, reduced board space and improved system assembly yields. By combining
all of the necessary communications functions for a complete system solution, Skyworks can
deliver additional semiconductor content, thereby offering existing and potential
customers more compelling and cost-effective solutions.

Capturing an Increasing
Amount of Semiconductor Content

We enable our customers to start with
individual components as necessary, and then migrate up the product integration ladder. We
believe that our highly integrated solutions will enable these customers to speed their
time to market while focusing their resources on product differentiation through a broader
range of more sophisticated, next-generation features.

Diversifying Customer Base

Skyworks supports virtually every
wireless handset OEM including Nokia Corporation, Motorola, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.,
Sony/Ericsson and LG Electronics, Inc. Additionally, we supply ODMs such as Arima, BenQ,
Chi Mei, Compal and Quanta as well as emerging domestic handset suppliers throughout
China. With the industry’s move to outsourcing to enable increased OEM focus on brand
and channel development, we believe we are particularly well-positioned to address the
growing needs of new market entrants and established suppliers alike who seek RF and
system-level integration expertise.

Delivering Operational
Excellence

The Skyworks operations team
leverages world-class manufacturing technologies and enables highly integrated modules as
well as system-level solutions. Skyworks will vertically integrate where it can
differentiate or will otherwise enter alliances and partnerships for leading-edge
capabilities. These partnerships and alliances are designed to ensure product leadership
and competitive advantage in the marketplace. We are focused on achieving the
industry’s shortest cycle times, highest yields and ultimately the lowest cost
structure.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

Our products are primarily sold
through a direct Skyworks sales force. This team is globally deployed across all major
market regions. In some markets we supplement our direct sales effort with independent
manufacturers’ representatives, assuring broader coverage of territories and
customers. We also utilize distribution partners, some of which are franchised globally
with others specific to North American markets.

We maintain an internal marketing
organization that is responsible for developing sales and advertising literature, print
media such as product announcements and catalogs, as well as a variety of web-based
content. Skyworks’ sales engagement begins at the earliest stages in a customer
design. We strive to provide close technical collaboration with our customers at the
inception of a new program. This partnership allows our team to facilitate customer-driven
solutions, which leverage the unique strength of our portfolio while providing high value
and greatly reduced time to market.

We believe that the technical and
complex nature of our products and markets demands an extraordinary commitment to close
ongoing relationships with our customers. As such, we strive to expand the scope of our
customer relationship to include design, engineering, manufacturing, purchasing and
project management. We also employ a collaborative approach in developing these
partnerships by combining the support of our design teams, applications engineers,
manufacturing personnel, sales and marketing staff and senior management.

We believe that maintaining frequent
and interactive contact with our customers is paramount to our continuous efforts to
provide world-class sales and service support. By listening and responding to feedback, we
are able to mobilize actions to raise the level of customer satisfaction, improve our
ability to anticipate future product needs, and enhance our understanding of key market
dynamics. We are confident that diligence in following this path will position Skyworks to
participate in numerous opportunities for growth in the future.

CUSTOMERS

For information regarding customer
concentration for each of the last three fiscal years, see

Note 16 of Item 8

of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

We own or are licensed under numerous
United States and foreign patents and patent applications related to our products, our
manufacturing operations and processes and other activities. In addition, we own a number
of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and services. We
believe that intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trade secrets
and trademarks are of material importance to our business. We rely on patent, copyright,
trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and
confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary
technologies, devices, algorithms and processes. We cannot guarantee that these efforts
will meaningfully protect our intellectual property, and others may independently develop
substantially equivalent proprietary technologies, devices, algorithms or processes. In
addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States, and effective copyright, patent, trademark and
trade secret protection may not be available in those jurisdictions. In addition to
protecting our proprietary technologies and processes, we strive to strengthen our
intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to obtain cross-licenses of
intellectual property from others, to obtain access to intellectual property we do not
possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims against us.
Due to rapid technological changes in the industry, we believe that establishing and
maintaining a technological leadership position depends primarily on our ability to
develop new innovative products through the technical competence of our engineering
personnel.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

We compete on the basis of time to
market; new product innovation; overall product quality and performance; price; compliance
with industry standards; strategic relationships with customers and protection of our
intellectual property. Certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can
to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to
devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we
can.

Current and potential competitors
also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among
themselves or with our customers, resellers, suppliers or other third parties. These
relationships may affect our customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is
possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly
acquire significant market share. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to
compete successfully against current and potential competitors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our products and markets are subject
to continued technological advances. Recognizing the importance of such technological
advances, we maintain a high level of research and development activities. We maintain
close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market
demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands. Our design centers are
strategically located around the world to be in close proximity to our customers and to
take advantage of key technical and engineering talent worldwide. We are focusing our
development efforts on new products, design tools and manufacturing processes using our
core technologies.

Our research and development
expenditures for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $152.6 million, $156.1 million and $133.6
million, respectively.

RAW MATERIALS

Raw materials for our products and
manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources. We do not carry
significant inventories and it is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply
unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise. Consequently, there are limited
situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single
or limited sources. We purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual
purchase orders. However, we have a limited number of long-term supply contracts with our
suppliers. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and
components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world.

Under supply agreements entered into
with Conexant and subsequently with Jazz Semiconductor, Inc. (“Jazz
Semiconductor”), we receive wafer fabrication, wafer probe and certain other services
from Jazz Semiconductor. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we are committed to
obtaining certain minimum wafer volumes from Jazz Semiconductor through March 2005. Our
expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements will be approximately
$12.9 million for fiscal 2005. We currently anticipate meeting our minimum purchase
obligation under these supply agreements.

BACKLOG

Our sales are made primarily pursuant
to standard purchase orders for delivery of products, with such purchase orders officially
acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions. Due to industry practice,
which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to
shipment with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date is
not a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

Federal, state and local requirements
relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous
wastes, and other activities affecting the environment have had, and will continue to
have, an impact on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with environmental
requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without
material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial
condition.

We believe that our current
expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with
present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the
resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our
liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. We cannot
assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

CYCLICALITY; SEASONALITY

The semiconductor industry is highly
cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological change. Product obsolescence, price
erosion, evolving technical standards and shortened product life cycles may contribute to
wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. These and other factors, together with
changes in general economic conditions, may cause significant upturns and downturns in the
industry, and in our business. We have experienced periods of industry downturns
characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, excess inventory
levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. These factors may cause
substantial fluctuations in our revenues and our operational performance. We have
experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business in the past and may experience
cyclical fluctuations in the future.

Sales of our products are also
subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in end-user consumer
applications, such as mobile handsets. This generally occurs in the last calendar quarter
ending in December. Sales of semiconductor products and system solutions used in these
products generally increase just prior to this quarter and continue at a higher level
through the end of the calendar year.

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For information regarding net
revenues by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years,

see Note 16 of Item

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

EMPLOYEES

As of October 1, 2004, the Company
employed approximately 4,200 persons. Approximately 1,100 employees in Mexico are covered
by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our future success will depend in large
part upon our continued ability to attract, motivate, develop and retain highly skilled
and dedicated employees.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

We own and lease manufacturing
facilities and other real estate properties in the United States and a number of foreign
countries. For information regarding property, plant and equipment by geographic region
for each of the last two fiscal years, see

Note 16 of Item 8

of this Annual Report on Form
10-K. We own and lease approximately 900,000 square feet and 100,000 square feet,
respectively, of office and manufacturing space. In addition, we lease approximately
430,000 square feet of sales office and design center space with approximately 22% of this
space located in foreign countries. We are headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts and have
executive offices in Irvine, California. The following table sets forth our principal
facilities measuring 50,000 square feet or more:

facilities necessary to operate at present levels.

Certain of our facilities, including
our California and Mexico facilities, are located near major earthquake fault lines. We
maintain no earthquake insurance with respect to these facilities.

In fiscal 2003, we relocated our
operations from our Haverhill, Massachusetts facility to our Woburn, Massachusetts
facility. We actively marketed the property located in Haverhill, Massachusetts and in
March 2004, entered into a contractual agreement for the sale of the property, contingent
upon obtaining specific regulatory approvals within the next two years.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time various lawsuits,
claims and proceedings have been, and may in the future be, instituted or asserted against
Skyworks, including those pertaining to patent infringement, intellectual property,
environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment and contractual matters.
In addition, in connection with the Merger, Skyworks has assumed responsibility for all
then current and future litigation (including environmental and intellectual property
proceedings) against Conexant or its subsidiaries in respect of the operations of
Conexant’s wireless business. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to
Skyworks. Intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief which, if
imposed against Skyworks, could materially and adversely affect the financial condition or
results of operations of Skyworks.

Additionally, the semiconductor
industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property
rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert
patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that
are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we
license their technology. At the present time, the Company is in litigation with Qualcomm
Incorporated (“Qualcomm”) regarding claims that both the Company and Qualcomm
filed, and first served against each other on December 4, 2003, asserting violations of
certain of each company’s respective intellectual property rights. The Company
believes Qualcomm’s claims are without merit and is vigorously defending against
Qualcomm’s claims and fully prosecuting its claims against them.

in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Because the Merger was accounted for
as a reverse acquisition, a purchase of Alpha by Washington/Mexicali, the historical
financial statements of Washington/Mexicali became the historical financial statements of
Skyworks after the Merger. The historical information provided below does not include the
historical financial results of Alpha for periods prior to June 26, 2002, the date the
Merger was consummated. The historical financial information may not be indicative of the
Company’s future performance and does not reflect what the results of operations and
financial position prior to the Merger would have been had Washington/Mexicali operated
independently of Conexant during the periods presented prior to the Merger or had the
results of Alpha been combined with those of Washington/Mexicali during the periods
presented prior to the Merger.

(1)

The Merger was completed on June 25, 2002. Financial statements for periods
               prior to June 26, 2002 represent Washington/Mexicali’s combined results and
               financial condition. Financial statements for periods after June 25, 2002
               represent the consolidated results and financial condition of Skyworks, the
               combined company.

(2)

In fiscal 2001, the Company recorded $58.7 million of inventory write-downs.

(3)

Amounts in fiscal 2003 primarily reflect amortization of current technology and
               customer relationships acquired in the Merger. Amounts in fiscal 2002, 2001 and
               2000, primarily reflect amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets
               related to the acquisition of Philsar Semiconductor Inc. in fiscal 2000.

(4)

In fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2000, the Company recorded purchased in-process
               research and development charges of $65.5 million and $24.4 million,
               respectively, related to the Merger and the acquisition of Philsar Semiconductor
               Inc., respectively.

(5)

In fiscal 2004, the Company recorded special charges of $17.4 million,
               principally related to the impairment of legacy technology licenses related to
               the Company’s cellular systems business and certain restructuring charges.
               In fiscal 2003, the Company recorded special charges of $34.5 million,
               principally related to the impairment of assets related to the Company’s
               infrastructure products and certain restructuring charges. In fiscal 2002, the
               Company recorded special charges of $116.3 million, principally related to the
               impairment of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and the related
               facility in Mexicali, Mexico, and the write-off of goodwill and other intangible
               assets related to Philsar Semiconductor Inc. In fiscal 2001, the Company
               recorded special charges of $88.9 million, principally related to the impairment
               of certain wafer fabrication assets and restructuring activities.

(6)

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
               “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” on October 1, 2002. As a
               result of this adoption, the Company performed a transitional evaluation of its
               goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Based on this transitional
               evaluation, the Company determined that its goodwill was impaired and recorded a
               $397.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
               principle in fiscal 2003.

(7)

Prior to the Merger with Alpha Industries, Inc., Washington/Mexicali had no
               separate capitalization. Therefore, a calculation cannot be performed for
               weighted average shares outstanding to then calculate earnings per share.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

The following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with
our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following
discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due
to a number of factors, including but not limited to risk factors, risks and cautionary
statements described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW

Skyworks Solutions, Inc.
(“Skyworks” or the “Company”) is a leading wireless semiconductor
company focused exclusively on radio frequency (“RF”) and complete cellular
system solutions for mobile communications applications. We offer front-end modules, RF
subsystems and cellular systems to leading wireless handset and infrastructure customers.

The wireless communications
semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid technological
change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product
life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results have
been, and our operating results may continue to be, negatively affected by substantial
quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors, such as
changes in demand for end-user equipment, the timing of the receipt, reduction or
cancellation of significant customer orders, the gain or loss of significant customers,
market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products, our ability to
develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,
availability and cost of products from suppliers, new product and technology introductions
by competitors, changes in the mix of products produced and sold, intellectual property
disputes, the timing and extent of product development costs and general economic
conditions. In the past, average selling prices of established products have generally
declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future.

OUR STRATEGY

Skyworks’ vision is to become
the premier supplier of wireless semiconductor solutions. Key elements in our strategy
include:

Leveraging Core
Technologies

Skyworks deploys technology building
blocks such as radio frequency integrated circuits, analog/mixed-signal processing cores
and digital baseband engines as well as software across multiple product platforms. We
believe that this approach creates economies of scale in research and development and
facilitates a reduction in the time to market for key products.

Increasing Integration
Levels

High levels of integration enhance
the benefits of our products by reducing production costs through the use of fewer
external components, reduced board space and improved system assembly yields. By combining
all of the necessary communications functions for a complete system solution, Skyworks can
deliver additional semiconductor content, thereby offering existing and potential
customers more compelling and cost-effective solutions.

Capturing an Increasing
Amount of Semiconductor Content

We enable our customers to start with
individual components as necessary, and then migrate up the product integration ladder. We
believe that our highly integrated solutions will enable these customers to speed their
time to market while focusing their resources on product differentiation through a broader
range of more sophisticated, next-generation features.

Diversifying Customer Base

Skyworks supports virtually every
wireless handset OEM including Nokia Corporation, Motorola, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.,
Sony/Ericsson and LG Electronics, Inc. Additionally, we supply ODMs such as Arima, BenQ,
Chi Mei, Compal and Quanta as well as emerging domestic handset suppliers throughout
China. With the industry’s move to outsourcing to enable increased OEM focus on brand
and channel development, we believe we are particularly well-positioned to address the
growing needs of new market entrants and established suppliers alike who seek RF and
system-level integration expertise.

Delivering Operational
Excellence

The Skyworks operations team
leverages world-class manufacturing technologies and enables highly integrated modules as
well as system-level solutions. Skyworks will vertically integrate where it can
differentiate or will otherwise enter alliances and partnerships for leading-edge
capabilities. These partnerships and alliances are designed to ensure product leadership
and competitive advantage in the marketplace. We are focused on achieving the
industry’s shortest cycle times, highest yields and ultimately the lowest cost
structure.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

On June 25, 2002, pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of December 16, 2001, as amended as of
April 12, 2002, by and among Alpha Industries, Inc. (“Alpha”), Conexant Systems,
Inc. (“Conexant”) and Washington Sub, Inc. (“Washington”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Conexant to which Conexant spun off its wireless communications
business, including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility located in Newbury
Park, California, but excluding certain assets and liabilities, Washington merged with and
into Alpha with Alpha as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). Following the
Merger, Alpha changed its corporate name to Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

Immediately following completion of
the Merger, the Company purchased Conexant’s semiconductor assembly, module
manufacturing and test facility located in Mexicali, Mexico, and certain related
operations (“Mexicali Operations”) for $150 million. For financial accounting
purposes, the sale of the Mexicali Operations by Conexant to Skyworks Solutions was
treated as if Conexant had contributed the Mexicali Operations to Washington as part of
the spin-off, and the $150 million purchase price was treated as a return of capital to
Conexant. For purposes of these financial statements, the Washington business and the
Mexicali Operations are collectively referred to as Washington/Mexicali. References to the
“Company” refer to Washington/Mexicali for all periods prior to June 26, 2002,
and to the combined company following the Merger.

The Merger was accounted for as a
reverse acquisition whereby Washington was treated as the acquirer and Alpha as the
acquiree, primarily because Conexant shareholders owned a majority, approximately 67
percent, of the Company upon completion of the Merger. Under a reverse acquisition, the
purchase price of Alpha was based upon the fair market value of Alpha common stock for a
reasonable period of time before and after the announcement date of the Merger and the
fair value of Alpha stock options. The purchase price of Alpha was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed by Washington, as the acquiring company for accounting
purposes, based upon their estimated fair market value at the acquisition date. Because
the historical financial statements of the Company after the Merger do not include the
historical financial results of Alpha for periods prior to June 26, 2002, the financial
statements may not be indicative of future results of operations and are not indicative of
the historical results that would have resulted if the Merger had occurred at the
beginning of a historical financial period.

We entered into agreements with
Conexant providing for the supply to us of transition services by Conexant and for the
supply by us of gallium arsenide wafer fabrication and assembly and test services to
Conexant, initially at substantially the same volumes as historically obtained by Conexant
from Washington/Mexicali. We also entered into agreements with Conexant and Jazz
Semiconductor, providing for the supply to us of silicon-based wafer fabrication, wafer
probe and certain other services by Jazz Semiconductor. Historically, Washington/Mexicali
obtained a portion of its silicon-based semiconductors from the Newport Beach wafer
fabrication facility that is now owned by Jazz Semiconductor.

The financial statements prior to the
Merger were prepared using Conexant’s historical basis in the assets and liabilities
and the historical operating results of Washington/Mexicali during each respective period.
We believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable. However,
the financial information included herein and in our consolidated financial statements may
not be indicative of the combined assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of
the Company in the future and is not indicative of what they would have been had
Washington/Mexicali been a separate stand-alone entity and independent of Conexant during
the historical periods presented.

Our fiscal year ends on the Friday
closest to September 30. Fiscal 2003 consisted of 53 weeks and ended on October 3, 2003
and fiscal years 2004 and 2002 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on October 1, 2004 and
September 27, 2002, respectively. For convenience, the consolidated financial statements
have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month. Accordingly, references
to September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 contained in this discussion refer to our actual
fiscal year-end.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon
historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the
extent actual results differ from those estimates, our future results of operations may be
affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

— We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of
our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and
additional allowances would be required.

Inventories

— We assess the
recoverability of inventories through an on-going review of inventory levels relative to
sales backlog and forecasts, product marketing plans and product life cycles. When the
inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand (generally in excess of six months), we
write down the value of those excess inventories. We sell our products to communications
equipment original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that have designed our
products into equipment such as cellular handsets. These design wins are gained through a
lengthy sales cycle, which includes providing technical support to the OEM customer. In
the event of the loss of business from existing OEM customers, we may be unable to secure
new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins.
Consequently, when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed forecasted demand from
existing OEM customers into whose products our products have been designed, we generally
will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others, and the net realizable value of
such inventories is generally estimated to be zero. The amount of the write-down is the
excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value (generally zero). Once
established, these write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of
the excess inventory. Demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time, and
actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by
management. In the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected, additional
inventory write-downs may be required.

Valuation of long-lived assets,
goodwill and intangible assets

— Carrying values for long-lived assets and
definite-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for possible impairment
as circumstances warrant in connection with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” which was adopted on October 1, 2002. Impairment reviews are conducted at
the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable. The determination of
recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use of an asset and its eventual disposition. The estimate of cash flows is based
upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance.
Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among
other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to our business model or
changes in our operating performance. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows (excluding
interest) is less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss, measured as
the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is
determined using discounted cash flows.

Carrying values of goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for possible impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which was
adopted on October 1, 2002. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first
step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value. In
determining fair value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of several valuation
methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair
value. Step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its
carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation. If the carrying amount
of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that
excess. We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth
fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying
value of goodwill may be impaired.

Deferred income taxes

— We have
provided a valuation allowance related to our substantial United States deferred tax
assets. If sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income
in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent, we may be required to reduce our valuation
allowance, which may result in income tax benefits in our statement of operations. The
future realization of certain deferred tax assets will be applied to reduce the carrying
value of goodwill. The portion of the valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets
for which subsequently recognized tax benefits may be applied to reduce goodwill related
to the purchase consideration of the Merger is approximately $43 million. We evaluate the
realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance
quarterly. In fiscal 2002, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $23 million related
to the impairment of our Mexicali assets. A valuation allowance has not been established
because we believe that the related deferred tax asset will be recovered during the
carryforward period.

Revenue recognition

— Revenues
from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title, in accordance with
the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer. Revenue recognition is
deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete. Certain product sales
are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price
protection and/or a right of return on unsold products. We reduce revenue to the extent of
our estimate for distributor claims of price protection and/or right of return on unsold
product. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on
historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve.

GENERAL

During fiscal 2004, we made progress
in several key areas that contributed to an improvement in operating results and the
generation of positive cash flows from operations. More specifically, we:

•

experienced an increase in demand for our products and launched and ramped new highly integrated products;

•

experienced a 53% increase in units sold countered by a 17% aggregate decrease in the average selling price of our products;

•

reduced the number of days sales were outstanding in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to
65.8 from 87.5 for the same period in the previous fiscal year;

•

reduced research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expense
as a percentage of net revenues to 31.9% in fiscal 2004 from 39.1% for the previous fiscal
year;

•

converted our 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes into shares of our common
stock, ultimately reducing our future cash outflows and expenses related to the interest
incurred on these senior subordinated notes; and

•

invested $60.0 million in capital equipment primarily related to the design of new highly
integrated products and processes enabling us to address new opportunities and to meet our
customers’ demands.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, 2003
AND 2002

The following table sets forth the
results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal years
below:

We market and sell our semiconductor
products and system solutions to leading OEMs of communication electronics products,
third-party original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) and contract manufacturers
and indirectly through electronic components distributors.

Net revenues increased for fiscal
2004 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as the result of increased demand
for our wireless product portfolio. More specifically, we have launched a number of more
highly integrated product offerings, added to our customer base and expanded our
geographical market presence. Additionally, power amplifiers, front-end modules, RF
subsystems and complete cellular systems exhibited strong year-over-year growth. These
increases in net revenues were tempered by a decrease in average selling prices primarily
within our single function products and a decrease of approximately $15 million in net
revenues for our assembly and test services as demand for these services declined in
fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, the number of units we sold increased by approximately
53% when compared to fiscal 2003, however our average selling price across all products
decreased in the aggregate by approximately 17% when compared to the previous fiscal year.

Net revenues increased in fiscal 2003
when compared to fiscal 2002 primarily reflecting the exclusion of Alpha’s revenues
for periods prior to the Merger and increasing demand for our wireless product portfolio.
Had Alpha’s revenue been included for the nine month period prior to the Merger, net
revenue in fiscal 2002 would have been $543 million, as compared to the $458 million
reported. Accordingly, the majority of the increase in revenue in fiscal 2003 is
attributable to the exclusion of Alpha’s revenue up to the time of the Merger. On an
operational basis, the revenue increase in fiscal 2003 primarily resulted from an increase
in the number of RF subsystem units shipped (in both GSM and CDMA) due to the ramping of
new product offerings. An increase in unit volumes of front-end modules, however, was
offset by a decline in the average selling price of such products. In addition, lower CDMA
handset subsidies in Korea also adversely affected net revenues in fiscal 2003 when
compared to fiscal 2002. In certain global markets, wireless operators provide subsidies
on handset sales to their customers, ultimately decreasing the cost of the handset to the
customer.

Gross profit represents net revenues
less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials,
labor and overhead (including depreciation) associated with product manufacturing, royalty
and other intellectual property costs and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to
products sold. Cost of goods sold for the periods prior to the Merger also includes
allocations from Conexant of manufacturing cost variances, process engineering and other
manufacturing costs, which are not included in our unit costs but are expensed as
incurred.

Gross profit for fiscal 2004
benefited from increased operational efficiency through capacity utilization when compared
to the previous fiscal year. This benefit was partially offset by the aforementioned
decline in average selling prices and additional costs we incurred as we launched and
ramped a number of more highly integrated RF product offerings including our front-end
modules and single package radios. Gross profit for fiscal 2003 was favorably affected by
$4.8 million, or 70 basis points, when we reevaluated our obligation under wafer
fabrication supply agreements and reduced our liability and cost of sales. At the end of
the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we estimated that we would not be able to meet our
minimum purchase obligation under the wafer supply agreement with Conexant and Jazz
Semiconductor. Accordingly, we recorded this liability in cost of sales for the third
quarter of fiscal 2002. The following external factors contributed to the reductions in
cost of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003
relating to this liability:

•

an increase in demand for our products that resulted in the Company increasing its
purchases from the wafer supplier, Jazz Semiconductor ; and

•

an increase in orders for wafers placed by Conexant to Jazz Semiconductor that, when
combined with our purchases from Jazz Semiconductor, resulted in the Company having no
liability related to its minimum purchase obligation.

Because of the increase in demand for
our products and the annual reduction in our minimum purchase obligations, as specified in
the agreement, the Company has met its minimum purchase obligation for each of the periods
subsequent to September 30, 2002. Furthermore, the Company currently expects to meet the
remaining minimum purchase obligations of $12.9 million for fiscal 2005 and will have no
further minimum purchase obligations under the wafer supply agreement subsequent to March
2005. Our costs will be affected by the extent of our use of outside foundries and the
pricing we are able to obtain. During periods of high industry demand for wafer
fabrication capacity, we may have to pay higher prices to secure wafer fabrication
capacity.

The improvement in gross profit in
fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 reflects increased revenues, improved utilization of
our manufacturing facilities and a decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from the
write-down of our Mexicali facility assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Although
revenue growth in fiscal 2003 increased the level of utilization of our manufacturing
facilities, these facilities continued to operate below optimal capacity and
underutilization continued to adversely affect our unit cost of goods sold and gross
profit.

Gross profit in fiscal 2003 was also
favorably affected by the aforementioned $4.8 million reduction to our liability and cost
of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 when we reevaluated our obligation under the
wafer supply agreement with Conexant and Jazz Semiconductor.

Research and development expenses
consist principally of direct personnel costs, costs for pre-production evaluation and
testing of new devices and design and test tool costs. Research and development expenses
for the periods prior to the Merger also include allocated costs for shared research and
development services provided by Conexant, principally in the areas of advanced
semiconductor process development, design automation and advanced package development, for
the benefit of several of Conexant’s businesses.

The decrease in research and
development expenses in fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous fiscal year is primarily
attributable to our commitment to streamlining our processes and focusing our product
development on integrated products to meet the needs of our customers. In addition,
research and development expenses were lower in fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous
year as we realized benefits from cost saving initiatives implemented in the previous two
fiscal years. More specifically, we focused our product development on core front-end
modules, RF subsystems, cellular systems, infrastructure and next generation solutions.

The increase in research and
development expenses in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 represents our commitment to
design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our
customers’ demands. We expanded customer support engagements as well as development
efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the CDMA2000, GSM, General Packet Radio
Services, or GPRS, and third-generation, or 3G, wireless standards in both the digital
cellular handset and infrastructure markets. The increase in research and development
expenses in fiscal 2003 when compared to the previous year is also related to our research
and development expenses representing those of the combined company after the Merger
whereas those expenses in 2002 are representative of only Washington/Mexicali prior to
June 25, 2002.

Selling, general and administrative
expenses include personnel costs (legal, accounting, treasury, human resources,

advertising and other marketing costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses also
include allocated general and administrative expenses from Conexant for the periods prior
to the Merger for a variety of these shared functions.

The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses in fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous year is primarily
attributable to an increase of approximately $5 million in legal expenses related to
protecting our intellectual property portfolio. In addition, we incurred performance
related compensation expenses in fiscal 2004, which were not incurred in fiscal 2003. We
tie incentive compensation to the accomplishment of specific financial objectives each
fiscal year and met these objectives in fiscal 2004, whereas these objectives were not met
in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2004, we also incurred information systems conversion costs,
whereas these expenses were not incurred in fiscal 2003. We transitioned our information
systems services from Conexant Systems, Inc. to a third-party service provider during the
third quarter of fiscal 2004. These increases in selling, general and administrative
expenses for fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous year were partially offset by
realization of the benefit of cost saving initiatives implemented in the previous two
fiscal years.

The increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily related
to our selling, general and administrative expenses representing those of the combined
company after the Merger whereas those expenses for the same period in 2002 are

In 2002, we recorded $36.4 million of
intangible assets related to the Merger consisting of developed technology, customer
relationships and a trademark. These assets are principally being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a 10-year period. Amortization expense in fiscal 2004 and fiscal
2003 primarily represents the amortization of these intangible assets. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003, we wrote down certain intangible assets related to our
infrastructure business based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management in
response to a decline in demand for, and a decision to discontinue, certain infrastructure
products. This write-down established a new cost basis for these assets and resulted in a
decrease in amortization expense for fiscal 2004 when compared to fiscal 2003.

Amortization expense for fiscal 2002
primarily represents amortization of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection
with Washington/Mexicali’s acquisition of Philsar Semiconductor, Inc.
(“Philsar”) in fiscal 2000. Philsar was a developer of RF semiconductor
solutions for personal wireless connectivity, including emerging standards such as
Bluetooth, and RF components for third-generation digital cellular handsets. We wrote off
all goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisition of the Philsar
Bluetooth business in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. The lower amortization expense in
fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002, primarily resulted from the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,” on October 1, 2002. Had the Company ceased amortizing
goodwill on October 1, 2000, amortization expense would have been $10.7 million less in
fiscal 2002.

Special charges consists of charges
for asset impairments and restructuring activities, as follows:

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

During the second quarter of fiscal 2004,
we recorded a $13.2 million charge primarily related to the impairment of obsolete
baseband technology licenses that were established prior to the Merger. This charge
includes approximately $1.8 million of contractual payment obligations, which we expect to
pay within one year. The impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared
by management in response to the decision to discontinue certain products and the related
impact on its current and projected outlook. Management believed these factors indicated
that the carrying value of the related assets (intangible assets, machinery and equipment)
were impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed. In performing the
analysis for recoverability, management estimated the future cash flows expected to result
from these products (salvage value). Since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less
than the carrying value of the related assets, it was concluded that an impairment loss
should be recognized. In accordance with SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the impairment charge was determined by comparing
the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value. The write down
established a new cost basis for the impaired assets.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003, we recorded a $26.0 million charge for the impairment of assets related to certain
infrastructure products manufactured in our Woburn, Massachusetts and Adamstown, Maryland
facilities. The Woburn facility primarily manufactures semiconductor products based on
both silicon wafer technology and gallium arsenide technology. Our Adamstown, Maryland
facility primarily manufactures ceramics components. We experienced a significant decline
in factory utilization resulting from a downturn in the market for products manufactured
at these two facilities and a decision to discontinue certain products. The impairment
charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management based on these
factors and the related impact on our current and projected outlook. We projected lower
revenues and new order volume for these products and management believed these factors
indicated that the carrying value of the related assets (machinery, equipment and
intangible assets) may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be
performed. In performing the analysis for recoverability, management estimated the future
cash flows expected to result from these products over a five-year period. Since the
estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets,
it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized. In accordance with SFAS No.
144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the
impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related
assets to their carrying value. The fair value of the assets was determined by computing
the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 16%, which
management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the
projected future cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used in the discounted
cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets. The
write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets. The anticipated pre-tax
cost savings related to these impairment charges is expected to be $17.4 million from
fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008 and $8.6 million from fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2023.

In addition, during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a $2.3 million charge for the impairment of our
Haverhill, Massachusetts property. In fiscal 2003, we relocated our operations from this
facility to our Woburn, Massachusetts facility. We actively marketed the property located
in Haverhill, Massachusetts and in March 2004, entered into a contractual agreement for
the sale of the property, contingent upon obtaining specific regulatory approvals within
the next two years.

During fiscal 2002, the Company
recorded a $66.0 million charge for the impairment of the assembly and test machinery and
equipment and related facility in Mexicali, Mexico. The impairment charge was based on a
recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of a significant downturn in
the market for test and assembly services for non-wireless products and the related impact
on our current and projected outlook.

We experienced a severe decline in
factory utilization at our Mexicali facility for non-wireless products and projected
decreasing revenues and new order volume. Management believed these factors indicated that
the carrying value of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility
may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed. In performing
the analysis for recoverability, management estimated the future cash flows expected to
result from the manufacturing activities at the Mexicali facility over a ten-year period.
The estimated future cash flows were based on a gradual phase-out of services sold to
Conexant and modest volume increases consistent with management’s view of the outlook
for the business, partially offset by declining average selling prices. The declines in
average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and management’s
decision to reduce capital expenditures for future capacity expansion. Since the estimated
undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value (approximately $100 million
based on historical cost) of the related assets, it was concluded that an impairment loss
should be recognized. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair
value of the related assets to their carrying value. The fair value of the assets was
determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a
discount rate of 24%, which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks
associated with the projected future cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used
in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of
the assets. The write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets.

During fiscal 2002, we recorded a
$45.8 million charge for the write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets associated
with our acquisition of Philsar in fiscal 2000. Management determined that we would not
support the technology associated with the Philsar Bluetooth business. Accordingly, this
product line was discontinued and the employees associated with the product line were
either severed or relocated to other operations. As a result of the actions taken,
management determined that the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets associated
with the Philsar acquisition were impaired.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

During fiscal 2004, we consolidated
cellular systems software design centers in an effort to improve our overall time to
market for next generation multimedia systems development. These actions aligned our
structure with our current business environment. We implemented reductions in force at
three remote facilities and recorded restructuring charges of approximately $4.2 million
for costs related to severance benefits for affected employees and lease obligations.
Substantially all amounts accrued for these actions are expected to be paid within one
year.

During fiscal 2003, we recorded $6.2
million in restructuring charges to provide for workforce reductions and the consolidation
of facilities. The charges were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for
affected employees and lease cancellation, facility sales, and other costs related to the
consolidation of facilities. Substantially all amounts accrued for these actions have been
paid and the remaining amounts are expected to be paid within one year.

During fiscal 2002, we implemented a
number of cost reduction initiatives to more closely align our cost structure with the
then-current business environment. We recorded restructuring charges of approximately $3.0
million for costs related to the workforce reduction and the consolidation of certain
facilities. All amounts accrued for these actions have been paid.

The decrease in interest expense for
fiscal 2004 when compared to the previous fiscal year is primarily related to the
conversion of our $45 million of senior subordinated notes into shares of our common stock
during the third quarter of fiscal 2004. On April 22, 2004, we notified the holder of the
senior notes that we would redeem such notes in full on May 12, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the
holder of the senior notes converted such notes in full for approximately 5.7 million
shares of our common stock. We paid interest in cash on the senior notes on the last
business day of each March, June, September and December of each year. Interest paid on
the senior notes is not deductible for tax purposes because of the conversion feature.

The Company entered into borrowing
arrangements at the time of the Merger, therefore the increase in interest expense for
fiscal 2003, when compared to the previous year is primarily the result of fiscal 2002
representing approximately three months of interest incurred, whereas fiscal 2003 includes
interest for twelve months.

As a result of our history of operating  losses and the expectation of future operating  results,  we determined that it is more likely
than not that historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized except for certain future  deductions  associated with
our foreign  operations.  Consequently,  no United States income tax benefit has been recognized relating to the U.S. operating losses.
As of September  30, 2004, we have  established a valuation  allowance  against all of our net U.S.  deferred tax assets.  Deferred tax
assets have been recognized for foreign operations when management believes they will be recovered during the carry forward period.

During the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004,  we reduced the  carrying  value of our  deferred  tax assets by $3.5  million.  This charge
primarily  originated from foreign  currency  translation  errors after  establishing  the $23.1 million tax benefit recorded in fiscal
2002 for the impairment of our assembly and test machinery and equipment in Mexicali,  Mexico immediately  following  completion of the
Merger.  The  cumulative  effect of these  errors is being  reported  in the  provision  for  income  taxes  line of the  statement  of
operations in the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004, as it did not have a material  impact in prior  periods.  The aggregate  $3.5 million
charge  listed by fiscal year would be  approximately  $1.2  million,  $2.0 million and $0.3  million for fiscal  2004,  2003 and 2002,
respectively.

In addition,  the provision  (benefit) for income taxes for fiscal 2004,  2003 and 2002 consists of foreign  income taxes  incurred by
foreign  operations.  We do not expect to recognize any income tax benefits relating to future operating losses generated in the United
States until management determines that such benefits are more likely than not to be realized.

No provision has been made for United  States,  state,  or additional  foreign income taxes related to  approximately  $16.7 million of
undistributed  earnings of foreign  subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently  reinvested.  It is not practical to
determine  the United States  federal  income tax  liability,  if any,  which would be payable if such  earnings  were not  permanently
reinvested.

accounting principle

We adopted SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” October 1, 2002 and performed a
transitional impairment test for goodwill. As a result, we determined that the carrying
amount of our goodwill was $397.1 million greater than its implied fair value. This
transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle and is reflected in our results of operations as of the beginning of
fiscal 2003. The significant impairment charge to goodwill shortly after the Merger
resulted from a significant decline in the market price of our common stock. The first
step of the goodwill impairment analysis compares fair value to net book value. In
determining fair value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of several valuation
methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair
value. We hired a third-party firm to perform the fair value calculation for the Merger
and subsequent SFAS 142 valuation. The fair value calculation used to determine the
purchase price for the Merger was performed in December 2001, the date at which the
principal terms of the Merger were agreed upon by both parties. The calculation was based
on the average market price of our common stock over a seven-day period. This same
methodology was used to determine our fair value at October 1, 2002 for the required
transitional impairment test upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Between the time of the
Merger calculation in December 2001 and the SFAS No. 142 calculation in October 2002, the
market price of our common stock declined as the wireless semiconductor industry
experienced a downturn in demand amid concerns about terrorism, deflation, decreased
consumer confidence, reduced capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity
concerns in the telecommunications and related industries. Since our fair value is
directly linked to the market price of our common stock, a significant decline in the
market price of our common stock could, and in this case did, result in an impairment
charge to goodwill. We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of
our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that
the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. We completed our annual goodwill
impairment test for fiscal 2004 and determined that as of July 5, 2004, our goodwill was
not impaired.

FISCAL 2004

During fiscal 2004, we made progress
in several key areas as we focused our efforts on both cash and inventory management. We
significantly reduced the number of days sales were outstanding in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004 to 65.8 from 87.5 for the same period in the previous fiscal year. Annualized
inventory turns for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were 6.6. Inventory management
remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to
ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of
rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. During fiscal 2004, we also
converted our 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes into shares of our common
stock, ultimately reducing our future cash outflows and expenses related to the interest
incurred on these senior subordinated notes.

In fiscal 2004, we generated $91.9
million in cash from operating activities as we experienced a significant improvement in
our operating results when compared to the previous fiscal year. This improvement was
primarily attributable to increased net revenues in fiscal 2004, when compared to the
previous fiscal year, primarily resulting from increased demand for our wireless product
portfolio. More specifically, we have launched a number of more highly integrated product
offerings, added to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence. In
addition, we reduced research and development expenses and selling, general and
administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues to 31.9% in fiscal 2004, from 39.1%
for the previous fiscal year. During fiscal 2004, we invested $60.0 million in capital
equipment primarily related to the design of new highly integrated products and processes,
enabling us to address new opportunities and to meet our customers’ demands. We
believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current
manufacturing capabilities. We may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our
technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings. We expect
our capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 to return to levels more comparable to fiscal
2003.

Cash provided by financing activities
in fiscal 2004 primarily represents an increase in borrowings under our $50 million credit
facility secured by the purchased accounts receivable with Wachovia Bank, National
Association. For additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements, see

Note 7
to the Consolidated Financial Statements

.

FISCAL 2003 AND FISCAL

Cash used in operating activities was
$72.1 million for fiscal 2003, reflecting a net loss of $451.4 million, offset by non-cash
charges (primarily asset impairments, depreciation and amortization) of $489.2 million and
a net decrease in working capital items of approximately $109.9 million, including $40.0
million of merger-related expense payments. As of September 30, 2003, substantially all
amounts accrued for merger-related expenses had been paid. We adopted SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” on October 1, 2002, and recorded a
$397.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,
representing the difference between the implied fair value and carrying value of our
goodwill. Operating results in fiscal 2003 improved when compared to fiscal 2002,
primarily as the result of increased revenues and improved utilization of our
manufacturing facilities. Cash used in operating activities was $99.1 million for fiscal
2002. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2002 reflect a net loss of $236.1 million, offset by
non-cash charges (depreciation and amortization, asset impairments and an in-process
research and development charge) of $221.6 million and a net increase in working capital
of approximately $84.6 million. During 2002, we consolidated facilities, reduced our work
force and continued to implement cost saving initiatives. In addition, increased revenues
and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities contributed to improved operating
results in fiscal 2002.

Cash used in investing activities for
fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $40.3 million. The capital
expenditures for fiscal 2003 represented our continued investment in production and test
facilities in addition to our commitment to invest in the capital needed to design new
products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers’ demands.
Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2003 also included $4.0 million of purchases
of short-term investments. Our short-term investments are classified as held-to-maturity
and consist primarily of commercial paper with original maturities of more than 90 days
and less than twelve months. Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2002
consisted of capital expenditures of $29.4 million and dividends to Conexant of $3.1
million offset by cash received of $67.1 million as a result of the Merger and $35.4
million from the sale of short-term investments acquired in the Merger.

On August 11, 2003, we filed a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC with respect to the issuance of up to $250
million aggregate principal amount of securities, including debt securities, common or
preferred shares, warrants or any combination thereof. This registration statement, which
the SEC declared effective on August 28, 2003, provides us with greater flexibility and
access to capital. On September 9, 2003, we issued 9.2 million shares of common stock
under our shelf registration statement. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal
2003 included approximately $102.2 million of net proceeds from this offering. We may from
time to time issue securities under the remaining balance of the shelf registration
statement for general corporate purposes.

Cash provided by financing activities
for fiscal 2003 also included the net impact of our private placement of $230 million of
4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007 and related debt refinancing with
Conexant on November 13, 2002. These subordinated notes can be converted into 110.4911
shares of common stock per $1,000 principal balance, which is the equivalent of a
conversion price of approximately $9.05 per share. The net proceeds from the note offering
were principally used to prepay $105 million of the $150 million debt to Conexant relating
to the purchase of the Mexicali Operations and to prepay the $65 million principal amount
outstanding as of November 13, 2002, under a separate loan facility with Conexant. In
connection with our prepayment of $105 million of the $150 million debt owed to Conexant
relating to the purchase of the Mexicali Operations, the remaining $45 million principal
balance was exchanged for new 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes with a
maturity date of June 30, 2005. On April 22, 2004, we notified the holder of the senior
notes that we would redeem such notes in full on May 12, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the holder
of the senior notes converted such notes in full for approximately 5.7 million shares of
our common stock. In addition to the retirement of $170 million in principal amount of
indebtedness owing to Conexant, we also retained approximately $53 million of net proceeds
of the private placement to support our working capital needs. In addition, as of
September 30, 2003, we had borrowings outstanding of $41.7 million under our $50 million
credit facility secured by the purchased accounts receivable with Wachovia Bank, National
Association. For additional information regarding our borrowing arrangements, see

Note 7
to the Consolidated Financial Statements

. Cash provided by financing activities consisted
of net transfers from Conexant, pre-Merger, of $50.4 million for fiscal 2002. Cash
provided by financing activities for fiscal 2002 also consisted of $30.0 million of
proceeds from borrowings against the revolving credit facility with Conexant.

Under supply agreements entered into
with Conexant and Jazz Semiconductor, we receive wafer fabrication, wafer probe and
certain other services from Jazz Semiconductor. Pursuant to these supply agreements, we
are committed to obtain certain minimum wafer volumes from Jazz Semiconductor through
March 2005. Our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are
anticipated to be approximately $12.9 million in fiscal 2005.

Based on our results of operations
for fiscal 2004 and current trends, we expect our existing sources of liquidity, together
with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our
research and development, capital expenditures, debt obligations, purchase obligations,
working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. However,
we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in
the future. In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to
help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. If we are unable to
obtain enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at all, our business
and operations could be materially adversely affected.

OTHER MATTERS

Inflation did not have a significant
impact upon our results of operations during the three-year period ended September 30,
2004.

CERTAIN BUSINESS RISKS

We operate in a rapidly changing
environment that involves a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control. This
discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect our future operating results.
These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem
immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or
business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following
risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating
results would likely suffer.

We operate in the highly cyclical
wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.

We operate primarily in the
semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving
industry standards. From time to time, changes in general economic conditions, together
with other factors, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry. Periods of
industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity,
excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. These
characteristics, and in particular their impact on the level of demand for digital
cellular handsets, may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and results of
operations.  Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe
and prolonged, and any prolonged delay or failure of the industry or the wireless
communications market to recover from downturns would materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. The semiconductor industry also
periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints, which may
affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. We have experienced these
cyclical fluctuations in our business and may experience cyclical fluctuations in the
future.

We have incurred substantial
operating losses in the past and may experience future losses.

Our operating results for fiscal
years 2002 and 2003 were adversely affected by a global economic slowdown, decreased
consumer confidence, reduced capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity
concerns in the telecommunications and related industries. These factors led to a slowdown
in customer orders, an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of
backlog, higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue, and an abrupt
decline in demand for many of the end-user products that incorporate our wireless
communications semiconductor products and system solutions. Although we recently emerged
from this period of economic weakness, should economic conditions deteriorate for any
reason, it could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, reduced
revenues or changes in our revenue mix, and other impacts that would materially and
adversely affect our operating results. Due to this economic uncertainty, although we were
profitable in fiscal 2004, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain such
profitability or that we will not experience future operating losses.

Additionally, the conflict in Iraq as
well as other contemporary international conflicts, acts of terrorism and civil and
military unrest have contributed to the economic uncertainty. These continuing and
potentially escalating conflicts can also be expected to place continued pressure on
economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. These conditions make it extremely
difficult for our customers, our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future
business activities. If such uncertainty continues or economic conditions worsen (or
both), our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be
materially and adversely affected.

The wireless semiconductor markets
are characterized by intense competition.

The wireless communications
semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete in particular are
intensely competitive. We compete with U.S. and international semiconductor manufacturers
of all sizes in terms of resources and market share. We currently face significant
competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will
continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in,
declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining
or increasing market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a
result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global
expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes.
We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our
markets include, among others:

•   time-to-market;

•   timely new product innovation;

•   product quality, reliability and performance;

•   product price;

•   features available in products;

•   compliance with industry standards;

•   strategic relationships with customers; and

•   access to and protection of intellectual property.

We
 cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors
 enjoy the benefit of:

•   long presence in key markets;

•   name recognition;

•   high levels of customer satisfaction;

•   ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property; and

•   strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.

As a result, certain competitors may
be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in
customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development,
promotion and sale of their products than we can.

Current and potential competitors
have established or may in the future establish financial or strategic relationships among
themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may
affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new
competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant
market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against
current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing
pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our success depends upon our ability
to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.

The wireless communications
semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, the markets into which we sell our
products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change,
rapid product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life
cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration and increased miniaturization,
and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely
on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a
timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices,
modules and system solutions is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including:

•   the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in
technology and industry standards;

•   the ability to obtain capacity
sufficient to meet customer demand;

•   the ability to define new products
that meet customer and market requirements;

•   the ability to complete
development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis;

•   the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors;

•   overall market acceptance of our products; and

•   the
ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.

Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends, among other factors, on the viability and
flexibility of our own internal information technology systems (“;IT Systems”). We upgrade and change our IT Systems from time to
time, and are currently implementing a system upgrade, and there can be no assurance that such upgrade will be successful.

We cannot assure you that we will
have sufficient resources to make the substantial investment in research and development
needed to develop and bring to market new and enhanced products in a timely manner. We
will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and
to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market
growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced
wireless communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that
our products will satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we
will be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also
cannot assure you that we will be able to respond successfully to new product
announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or
specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products
interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products
in sufficient quantities and that meet our customers requirements, our business and
results of operations would be materially and adversely harmed.

In addition, prices of many of our
products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. We believe that to remain
competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing
products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products to
remain competitive.

The markets into which we sell our
products are characterized by rapid technological change.

The demand for our products can
change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate. Our markets generally exhibit the
following characteristics:

•   rapid technological developments and product evolution;

•   rapid changes in customer requirements;

•   frequent new product introductions and enhancements;

•   demand for higher levels of integration, decreased size and decreased power consumption;

•   short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle of the
product; and

•   evolving industry standards.

These changes in our markets may
contribute to the obsolescence of our products. Our products could become obsolete or less
competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or
more of the above-noted factors.

The ability to attract and retain
qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our
products is critical to our success.

As the source of our technological
and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our
success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified
personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel.
The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor
industry, and therefore we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain
qualified management and other personnel necessary for the design, development,
manufacture and sale of our products. We may have particular difficulty attracting and
retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance, given, among other
things, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. The loss of the
services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and
motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
operate our business.

If OEMs and ODMs of communications
electronics products do not design our products into their equipment, we will have
difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a “design win” from a customer does
not guarantee future sales to that customer.

Our products are not sold directly to
the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on
OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from
among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these
“design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer
designs another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more
difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing
suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that
manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will
receive significant revenues from that customer. Even after a design win, the customer is
not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use
of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for
any other reason. We cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or to
convert design wins into actual sales, and any failure to do so could materially and
adversely affect our operating results.

Lengthy product development and sales
cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures before
generating any revenues related to those products.

After our product has been developed,
tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six months or longer to
integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months or more to
begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle
time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product
plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this
lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and
selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate the related revenues for
these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product
after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.

Uncertainties involving the ordering
and shipment of our products could adversely affect our business.

Our sales are typically made pursuant
to individual purchase orders and not under long-term supply arrangements with our
customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a
portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsold
products. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand
for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we
sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our
forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In
addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any
reason. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold
products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in
us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and,
in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Our reliance on a small number of
customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the
results of our operations.

A significant portion of our sales
are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these
major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders of
our products, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Sales to Motorola,
Inc. and to Samsung Electronics Co. represented approximately 14% and 12%, respectively,
of net revenues for fiscal 2004. Our future operating results will depend on the success
of these customers and other customers and our success in selling products to them.

Average product life cycles in the
semiconductor industry tend to be very short.

In the semiconductor industry,
product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales and development cycles.
Therefore, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material
revenue, and from time to time we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory. If
we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory that we are
not able to recover, and we are not able to compensate for those expenses, our operating
results would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we sell our products
at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products
in inventory, our operating results would be harmed.

Our leverage and our debt service
obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.

On September 30, 2004, we had total
indebtedness of approximately $280 million, which represented approximately 28% of our
total capitalization.

As long as our 4.75 percent
convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding, we will have debt service obligations
on such notes of approximately $10,925,000 per year in interest payments. If we issue
other debt securities in the future, our debt service obligations will increase. If we are
unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our
existing cash or investments, we may have to reduce or curtail other activities of our
business.

We intend to fulfill our debt service
obligations from cash generated by our operations, if any, and from our existing cash and
investments. If necessary, among other alternatives, we may add lease lines of credit to
finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other long-term debt, lines of credit and
other financing.

Our indebtedness could have
significant negative consequences, including:

•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
conditions;

•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;

•   requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from
operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available
for other purposes, including capital expenditures;

•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our
business and the industry in which we compete; and

•   placing us at a
possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have
better access to capital
resources.

Despite our current debt levels, we
are able to incur substantially more debt, which would increase the risks described above.

We face a risk that capital needed
for our business will not be available when we need it.

We may need to obtain sources of
financing in the future. We expect our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash
expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our research and
development, capital expenditures, debt obligations, purchase obligations, working capital
and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure
you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future. To
the extent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to
fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or
private equity or debt financing. Conditions existing in the U.S. capital markets if and
when we seek additional financing as well as the then current condition of the Company
will affect our ability to raise capital, as well as the terms of any such financing. We
may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis or at
all. Failure to obtain capital when required would have a material adverse effect on the
Company.

In addition, any strategic
investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require
additional capital resources. We cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these
investments and acquisitions will be available in the future.

Our manufacturing processes are
extremely complex and specialized.

Our manufacturing operations are
complex and subject to disruption, including for causes beyond our control. The
fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting
of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean
environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment, errors in any
step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer,
defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a
substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to
malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to
produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors present
could have a material adverse affect on our business. In addition, we may discover from
time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped, which may require us to
replace such products.

Additionally, our operations may be
affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production
facilities or those of our subcontractors. These disruptions may include electrical power
outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, or other natural or man-made
disasters. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause significant delays in
shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility or
subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor. In the event of such delays, we cannot
assure you that the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity,
would be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative wafer production or
assembly and test capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable
terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers. We may be unable to
obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either at our own facilities or
through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others.

Due to the highly specialized nature
of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing process, in the event of a
disruption at the Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusetts semiconductor wafer
fabrication facilities, alternative gallium arsenide production capacity would not be
immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to maintain and
improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and
profitability.

Minor deviations or perturbations in
the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some
cases, cause production to be suspended. Manufacturing yields for new products initially
tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and
typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing
includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material
variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on
our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing
yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will
continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing
semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from
the compression of product life cycles, which will require us to manufacture new products
faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and
quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing
conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.

We are dependent upon third parties
for the manufacture, assembly and test of our products.

We rely upon independent wafer
fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-based products and to
supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. We also utilize
subcontractors to package, assemble and test our products. There are significant risks
associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:

•   the lack of ensured wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer
prices;

•   limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production
costs and quality assurance; and

•   the inaccessibility of, or delays in
obtaining access to, key process technologies.

Although we have long-term supply
arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party
foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of
other customers. If we choose to use a new foundry, it will typically take an extended
period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products
from the new foundry. The foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to
deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their
facilities, particularly since some of them are located in earthquake zones. If any
disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing
sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or delays in
securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our
customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Under supply agreements entered into
with Conexant and Jazz Semiconductor, we receive wafer fabrication, wafer probe and
certain other services from Jazz Semiconductor. Pursuant to these supply agreements, we
are committed to obtaining certain minimum wafer volumes from Jazz Semiconductor until
March 2005. Our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are
anticipated to be approximately $12.9 million for fiscal 2005.

We are dependent upon third parties
for the supply of raw materials and components.

Our manufacturing operations depend on
obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the components used in our manufacturing
processes. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and
components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world. While we
do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently
dependent on a sole-source supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide
semiconductor manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities. We cannot assure
you that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier or that a supplier will be able
to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules. If we lost a
supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications or
delivery schedules, our ability to satisfy customer obligations could be materially and
adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw
materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection
with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more
suppliers. We may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our
raw material or component needs. If we were to enter into additional sole supplier
arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our
supply arrangements would be exacerbated.

Remaining competitive in the
semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and
achieving higher levels of design integration.

In order to remain competitive, we
expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line
width geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for
our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some
existing products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller
geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in
sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We
may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our
products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our
relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully.
We cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition
or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships. If our foundries or we
experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this
transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we
expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and
third party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to
achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely
basis, or at all.

We are subject to the risks of doing
business internationally.

A substantial majority of our net
revenues are derived from customers located outside the United States, primarily countries
located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have design centers and
suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test
facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own
packaging, assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and
operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad.
These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:

•   currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•   local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and
political instability;

•   disruptions of capital and trading markets;

•   restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of
funds and trade protection measures, including export duties,
quotas, customs duties, import or export controls and tariffs);

•   changes in legal or regulatory requirements;

•   natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war;

•   limitations on the repatriation of funds;

•   difficulty in obtaining distribution and support;

•   cultural differences in the conduct of
business;

•   the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting
trade, foreign investment and loans, and import or export

•   licensing requirements;

•   tax laws;

•   the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign
jurisdiction; and

•   limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our
intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.

Additionally, we are subject to risks
in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales
to their customers. Increases in handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can
result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand
for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in South Korea,
Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.

Our operating results may be
adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.

Our revenues, earnings and other
operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues, earnings and other
operating results may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are due to a number of
factors, many of which are beyond our control.

These factors include, among others:

•   changes in end-user demand for the products (principally digital cellular
handsets) manufactured and sold by our customers;

•   the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our
products;

•   production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing
yields;

•   availability and cost of products from our suppliers;

•   the gain or loss of significant customers;

• our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis;

•   new product and technology introductions by competitors;

•   changes in the mix of products produced and sold;

•   market acceptance of our products and our customers;

• intellectual property disputes;

The foregoing factors are difficult
to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect
our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating results fail to meet the
expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price
of our common stock.

Global economic conditions that
impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and
operating results.

Global economic weakness can have
wide-ranging effects on markets that we serve, particularly wireless communications
equipment manufacturers and network operators. The wireless communications industry
appears to be recovering from an industry-wide recession. We cannot predict whether a
recovery will continue, the rate of any such recovery, or what effects negative events,
such as war, may have on the economy or the wireless communications industry. The
continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to
this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the global
economy and to the wireless communications industry and create further uncertainties.
Further, an economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term. If it does not, our
ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired.

Our gallium arsenide semiconductors
may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.

Among our product portfolio, we
manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and components, principally
power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenide integrated circuits is
more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differential is due to
higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with
smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Therefore, to remain competitive, we
must offer gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their
silicon-based counterparts. If we do not continue to offer products that provide
sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost differential, our operating results
may be materially and adversely affected. We expect the costs of producing gallium
arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing their silicon
counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely-used process technologies for
certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance. We
cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require
performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions.

We may be subject to claims of
infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license
third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from
using our technology.

The semiconductor industry is
characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. From
time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert patent, copyright,
trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our
business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology
or refrain from using it. At the present time, we are in litigation with Qualcomm
Incorporated regarding claims each of us have filed and served against the other asserting
violations of certain of our respective intellectual property rights. Although we believe
their claims are without merit and we are vigorously defending against their claims and
fully prosecuting our claims against them, we cannot assure you that we will be successful
in defending ourselves from their claims or prosecuting our claims.

Any litigation to determine the
validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe intellectual property rights
of another, including claims arising from our contractual indemnification of our
customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts
and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any
specific claim, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of the
complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation.
If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:

•   pay substantial damages;

•   cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing
products or processes;

•   discontinue the use of infringing technology;

•   expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology; and

•   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which
license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.

We cannot assure you that our
operating results or financial condition will not be materially adversely affected if we
were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items.

Many of our products incorporate
technology licensed or acquired from third parties.

We sell products in markets that are
characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new
product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing levels of integration. Our
ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from
third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain in a
competitive posture. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially
reasonable terms and conditions, and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology, our
products or our customers’ products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we
could lose market share. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated
costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute technology to deliver competitive
products.

If we are not successful in
protecting our intellectual property rights, it may harm our ability to compete.

We rely on patent, copyright,
trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and
confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies,
information, data, devices, algorithms and processes. In addition, we often incorporate
the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our
designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such
third-party intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in
litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our
trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others,
including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to
divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our
business operations. We cannot assure you that:

•   the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other
violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers,
suppliers or other third parties will be successful;

•   any existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other
intellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented;
or

•   any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection.

Despite
these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and
use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or
design around our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails
to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar
products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. In addition,
effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or
limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.

Our success depends, in part, on our
ability to effect suitable investments, alliances and acquisitions, and to integrate
companies we acquire.

Although we have in the past and
intend to continue to invest significant resources in internal research and development
activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant
expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue
development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we intend to
review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product
offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. However,
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment,
alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if we consummate such
transactions, they could result in:

•   issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders;  
•   large one-time write-offs;

•   the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities;

•   the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company;

•   amortization expenses related to intangible assets; and

•   the diversion of management’s attention
from other business concerns.

Moreover, integrating acquired
organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming
and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and customers and
ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we
will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for
impairment. When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to
estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings. For instance, we recorded a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003 in the amount of
$397.1 million as a result of the goodwill obtained in connection with the Merger.

Certain provisions in our
organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire
control of us.

We have certain anti-takeover
measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws
and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make more
difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of
Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:

•   the division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a
staggered basis, one class each year;

•   the ability of our board of
directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further
authorization of stockholders;

•   a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent;

•   elimination
of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;

•   a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder
nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting
of stockholders;

•   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 percent
of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision
of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws;

•   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of our
shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation
relating to the election and removal of directors, the classified board or the right to
act by written consent;

•   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of our
shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members
of the board of directors and, in the event that the other party to the business
combination is the beneficial owner of 5 percent or more of our shares, a majority of
the members of board of directors in office prior to the time such other party became the
beneficial owner of 5 percent or more of our shares;

•   a fair price provision; and

•   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90 percent of our
shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.

In addition to the provisions in our
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any business
combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the
time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the
directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that
results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder
approval requirements are met.

We may be liable for penalties under
environmental laws, rules and regulations, which could adversely impact our business.

We have used, and will continue to
use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing operations and have been and
will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental protection regulations in the
United States. We cannot assure you that current or future regulation of the materials
necessary for our products would not have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Environmental regulations often require
parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault.
Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental
matters, including potential liabilities. We cannot assure you that the amount of expense
and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to
complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws
will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Our stock price has been volatile and
may fluctuate in the future. Accordingly, you might not be able to sell your shares of
common stock at or above the price you paid for them.

The trading price of our common stock
has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by
many factors, including:

•   our performance and prospects;

•   the performance and prospects of our major customers;

•   the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;

•   investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;

•   changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;

•   general financial and other market conditions; and

•   domestic and
international economic conditions.

Public stock markets have recently
experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility, particularly in the technology
sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of
securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or
disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies. These broad
market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common
stock.

In addition, fluctuations in our
stock price and our price-to-earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to
momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks
rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, particularly when viewed on
a quarterly basis. Furthermore, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of
securities analysts or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over
a short period of time. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your shares of common
stock at or above the price you paid.

Changes in the accounting treatment
of stock options could adversely affect our results of operations.

In
March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an exposure draft to require
companies to expense employee stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, for financial reporting purposes. A final
standard is expected to be issued by the end of 2004 and to be effective for interim or
annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Such stock option expensing would
require us to value our employee stock option grants pursuant to an option valuation
formula and amortize that value against our earnings over the vesting period in effect for
those options. We currently account for stock-based awards to employees in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
and have adopted the disclosure-only alternative of SFAS 123. If we are required to
expense employee stock options in the future, this change in accounting treatment would
materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations as the stock-based
compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings. For an
illustration of the effect of such a change on our recent results of operations, see

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to market risks, such
as changes in currency and interest rates, that arise from normal business operation. Our
financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
short-term debt and long-term debt. Our main investment objective is the preservation of
investment capital. Consequently, we invest with only high-credit-quality issuers and we
limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. We do not use derivative
instruments for speculative or investment purposes.

Our cash and cash equivalents are not
subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these
instruments. As of September 30, 2004, the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents
approximates fair value.

Our short-term debt primarily
consists of borrowings under our credit facility with Wachovia Bank, N.A. As of September
30, 2004, we had borrowings of $50.0 million outstanding under this credit facility.
Interest related to our short-term debt is at LIBOR plus 0.4% and was approximately 2.2%
at September 30, 2004. Consequently, we do not have significant cash flow exposure on our
short-term debt.

We issued fixed-rate debt, which is
convertible into our common stock at a predetermined conversion price. Convertible debt
has characteristics that give rise to both interest-rate risk and market risk because the
fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interest-rate
environment and the price of the underlying common stock. For the year ended September 30,
2004, our convertible debt, on an if-converted basis, was not dilutive and, as a result,
had no impact on our net income per share (assuming dilution). In future periods, the debt
may be converted, or the if-converted method may be dilutive and net income per share
(assuming dilution) would be reduced. Our long-term debt consists of $230 million of 4.75
percent unsecured convertible subordinated notes due November 2007. We do not believe that
we have significant cash flow exposure on our long-term debt.

Based on our overall evaluation of
our market risk exposures from all of our financial instruments at September 30, 2004, a
near-term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors
and StockholdersSkyworks

Solutions, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of September 30, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended September 30, 2004. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 for the years ended September 30, 2004,
2003 and 2002. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2004
and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended September 30, 2004 in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 6 to the
consolidated financial statements, effective October 1, 2002, the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.”

NOTE 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Skyworks Solutions, Inc.
(“Skyworks” or the “Company”) is a leading wireless semiconductor
company focused exclusively on radio frequency (“RF”) and complete cellular
system solutions for mobile communications applications. The Company offers front-end
modules, RF subsystems and cellular systems to leading wireless handset and infrastructure
customers.

On June 25, 2002, pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of December 16, 2001, as amended as of April
12, 2002, by and among Alpha Industries, Inc. (“Alpha”), Conexant Systems, Inc.
(“Conexant”) and Washington Sub, Inc. (“Washington”), a wholly owned
subsidiary of Conexant to which Conexant spun off its wireless communications business,
including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility located in Newbury Park,
California, but excluding certain assets and liabilities, Washington merged with and into
Alpha with Alpha as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). Following the Merger,
Alpha changed its corporate name to Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

Immediately following completion of
the Merger, the Company purchased Conexant’s semiconductor assembly, module
manufacturing and test facility located in Mexicali, Mexico, and certain related
operations (“Mexicali Operations”) for $150 million. For financial accounting
purposes, the sale of the Mexicali Operations by Conexant to Skyworks Solutions was
treated as if Conexant had contributed the Mexicali Operations to Washington as part of
the spin-off, and the $150 million purchase price was treated as a return of capital to
Conexant. For purposes of these financial statements, the Washington business and the
Mexicali Operations are collectively referred to as Washington/Mexicali. References to the
“Company” refer to Washington/Mexicali for all periods prior to June 26, 2002,
and to the combined company following the Merger.

The Merger was accounted for as a
reverse acquisition whereby Washington was treated as the acquirer and Alpha as the
acquiree, primarily because Conexant shareholders owned a majority, approximately 67
percent, of the Company upon completion of the Merger. Under a reverse acquisition, the
purchase price of Alpha was based upon the fair market value of Alpha common stock for a
reasonable period of time before and after the announcement date of the Merger and the
fair value of Alpha stock options. The purchase price of Alpha was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed by Washington, as the acquiring company for accounting
purposes, based upon their estimated fair market value at the acquisition date. Because
the historical financial statements of the Company after the Merger do not include the
historical financial results of Alpha for periods prior to June 26, 2002, the financial
statements may not be indicative of future results of operations and are not indicative of
the historical results that would have resulted if the Merger had occurred at the
beginning of a historical financial period.

The financial statements prior to the
Merger were prepared using Conexant’s historical basis in the assets and liabilities
and the historical operating results of Washington/Mexicali during each respective period.
Management believes the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable.
However, there can be no assurance that the financial information included herein reflects
the combined assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the Company in the
future or what they would have been had Washington/Mexicali been a separate stand-alone
entity and independent of Conexant during the periods presented.

Conexant used a centralized approach
to cash management and the financing of its operations. Cash deposits from
Washington/Mexicali were transferred to Conexant on a regular basis and were netted
against Conexant’s net investment. As a result, none of Conexant’s cash, cash
equivalents, marketable securities or debt was allocated to Washington/Mexicali in the
financial statements. Cash and cash equivalents in the financial statements, prior to the
acquisition, represented amounts held by certain foreign operations of
Washington/Mexicali. Changes in equity represented funding from Conexant for working
capital and capital expenditure requirements after giving effect to
Washington/Mexicali’s transfers to and from Conexant for its cash flows from
operations through June 25, 2002.

Historically, Conexant provided
financing for Washington/Mexicali and incurred debt at the parent level. The financial
statements for the periods prior to June 26, 2002 of Washington/Mexicali do not include an
allocation of Conexant’s debt or the related interest expense. Therefore, the
financial statements for fiscal 2002 do not necessarily reflect the financial position and
results of operations of Washington/Mexicali had it been an independent company as of the
dates, and for the periods presented.

The financial statements for the
periods prior to the Merger also include allocations of certain Conexant operating
expenses for research and development, legal, accounting, treasury, human resources, real
estate, information systems, distribution, customer service, sales, marketing, engineering
and other corporate services provided by Conexant, including executive salaries and other
costs. The operating expense allocations have been determined on bases that management
considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided to, or the
benefit received by, Washington/Mexicali. Management believes that the expenses allocated
to Washington/Mexicali are representative of the operating expenses that would have been
incurred had Washington/Mexicali operated as an independent company. Since the date of the
Merger, the Company has been performing these functions using its own resources or
purchased services, including certain services obtained from Conexant pursuant to a
transition services agreement, most of which expired on December 31, 2002. The Company
transitioned the remaining services from Conexant to third party providers during the
third quarter of fiscal 2004.

NOTE 2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of
Consolidation:

The
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year:

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2003
consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal years 2004 and 2002 each consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal
years 2004, 2003 and 2002 ended on October 1, 2004, October 3, 2003 and September 27,
2002, respectively. For convenience, the consolidated financial statements have been shown
as ending on the last day of the calendar month.

Use of Estimates:

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management
reviews its estimates based upon currently available information. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates.

The
combined financial statements have been prepared using Conexant’s historical basis in
the assets and liabilities and the historical operating results of Washington/Mexicali
during each respective period. The Company believes the assumptions underlying the
financial statements are reasonable. However, the Company cannot assure you that the
financial information included herein reflects the combined assets, liabilities, operating
results and cash flows of the Company in the future or what they would have been had
Washington/Mexicali been a separate stand-alone entity and independent of Conexant during
the periods presented.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenues
from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title, in accordance with
the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer. Revenue recognition is
deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete. Certain product sales
are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price
protection and/or a right of return on unsold products. A reserve for sales returns and
allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific
identification of an event necessitating a reserve.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash deposited in demand deposits at banks and highly liquid
investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Short-term
Investments:

The
Company’s short-term investments are classified as held-to-maturity. These
investments consist of commercial paper with original maturities of more than 90 days but
less than twelve months. Such short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value, due to the short period of time to maturity. Gains and losses are
included in investment income in the period they are realized.

Restricted Cash:

Restricted
cash is used to collateralize the Company’s obligation under a receivables purchase
agreement under which it has agreed to sell from time to time certain of its accounts
receivable to Skyworks USA, Inc. (“Skyworks USA”), a wholly-owned special
purpose entity that is fully consolidated for accounting purposes. Concurrently, Skyworks
USA entered into an agreement with Wachovia Bank, National Association providing for a $50
million credit facility (“Facility Agreement”) secured by the purchased accounts
receivable. For further information regarding the Facility Agreement, please see

Note 7 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Accounts Receivable:

Accounts
receivable consist of amounts due from normal business activities. The Company maintains
allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company’s
customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make future
payments, additional allowances may be required.

Inventories:

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. The
Company provides for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The recoverability of inventories
is assessed through an on-going review of inventory levels in relation to sales backlog
and forecasts, product marketing plans and product life cycles. When the inventory on hand
exceeds the foreseeable demand (generally in excess of six months), the value of such
inventory that is not expected to be sold at the time of the review is written down. The
amount of the write-down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value
(generally zero). Once established, these write-downs are considered permanent adjustments
to the cost basis of the excess inventory. If actual demand and market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be
required. Some or all of the inventories which have been written-down may be retained and
made available for sale. In the event that actual demand is higher than originally
projected, a portion of these inventories may be able to be sold in the future.
Inventories which have been written-down and are identified as obsolete are generally
scrapped.

Property, Plant and
Equipment:

Property,
plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method. Significant renewals and
betterments are capitalized and replaced units are written off. Maintenance and repairs,
as well as renewals of a minor amount, are expensed as incurred.

Estimated
useful lives used for depreciation purposes are five to 30 years for buildings and
improvements and three to 10 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are
depreciated over the lesser of the economic life or the life of the associated lease.

Property Held for Sale:

Property
held for sale at September 30, 2004, relates to land and buildings no longer in use and is
recorded at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company actively
marketed the property located in Haverhill, Massachusetts and in March 2004, the Company
entered into a contractual agreement for the sale of the property, contingent upon
obtaining specific regulatory approvals within the next two years.

Valuation of long-lived assets:

Carrying
values for long-lived assets and definite lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are
reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” Impairment reviews are conducted at the
judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable. The determination of
recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use of an asset and its eventual disposition. The estimate of cash flows is based
upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance.
The Company’s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows
due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to the
Company’s business model or changes in its operating performance. If the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value, the Company
recognizes an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds
the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined using discounted cash flows.

Goodwill and Intangible
Assets:

Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step of the
impairment analysis compares the Company’s fair value to its net book value. In
determining fair value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of several valuation
methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair
value. The Company basis its fair value calculation on the average market price of its
common stock over a seven-day period and its outstanding common stock. Step two of the
analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner
similar to purchase price allocation. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its
implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. We test our
goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in
interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may
be impaired. Indicators such as unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors,
unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel, and
acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired. Intangible
assets with estimable lives and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Recoverability of
intangible assets with estimable lives and other long-lived assets is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted
pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If these
comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable, the impairment loss recognized is
the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the related
estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is based on either discounted future pretax
operating cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the asset. The
Company determines the discount rate for this analysis based on the expected internal rate
of return for the related business and does not allocate interest charges to the asset or
asset group being measured. Considerable judgment is required to estimate discounted
future operating cash flows.

Deferred Financing Costs:

Financing
costs are capitalized as an asset on the Company’s balance sheet and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the financing.

Income Taxes:

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the
asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net
operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more
likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.

The
carrying value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets assumes that the Company will
be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based
on estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the
future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its
deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the Company’s
consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the
deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly.
Likewise, in the event that the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize
its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment
to the deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of
goodwill in the period such determination was made.

Research and Development
Expenditures:

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Product Warranties:

Warranties
are offered on the sale of certain products and an accrual was recorded for estimated
claims. The changes in the warranty reserve are as follows:

Financial Instruments:

The carring value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities
approximates fair value due to short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. Fair values of long-term debt, short-term debt, and short-term investments are based on quoted market prices at
the date of measurement.

Foreign Currency
Translation and Remeasurement:

The
foreign operations of the Company are subject to exchange rate fluctuations and foreign
currency transaction costs. The functional currency for the Company’s foreign
operations is the U.S. dollar. Exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in the results
of operations for the year.  Inventories, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and
intangible assets, costs of goods sold, and depreciation and amortization are remeasured
from the foreign currency into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates; other accounts
are translated at current exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from the
remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets are included in provision
(benefit) for income taxes and amounted to $2.2 million of expense in fiscal
2004. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of all other accounts are included
in other income (expense), net. The Company recognized a gain of $0.5 million related to
these remeasurements in fiscal 2004.

Stock Option Plans:

The
Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No.
25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations, in
accounting for employee stock options rather than the alternative fair value accounting
allowed by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” APB No. 25
provides that compensation expense relative to the Company’s employee stock options
is measured based on the intrinsic value of stock options granted at the grant date and
the Company recognizes compensation expense, if any, in its statement of operations using
the straight-line method over the vesting period for fixed awards. Under SFAS No. 123, the
fair value of stock options at the date of grant is recognized in earnings over the
vesting period of the options. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
– Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 to provide
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual
and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method on reported results.

No
stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted
under the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Prior to
the Merger with Alpha Industries, Inc., Conexant’s wireless business had no separate
capitalization. Therefore, the Company had no stock-based compensation prior to June 26,
2002.

Had
compensation cost for the Company’s stock option and stock purchase plans been
determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans
consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net
income (loss) would have been as follows:

For
purposes of pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, the estimated fair value of the
options is assumed to be amortized to expense over the options’ vesting period. The
fair value of the options granted has been estimated at the date of the grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
expected stock price volatility. Because options held by employees and directors have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes
in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the
opinion of management, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reasonable measure
of the fair value of these options.

Earnings Per Share:

Basic
earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive
effect of stock options and a stock warrant, using the treasury stock method, and debt
securities on an if converted basis, if their effect is dilutive. For the year ended
September 30, 2004, debt securities convertible into 25.4 million shares, stock options
exercisable into 19.0 million shares and a warrant to purchase 1.0 million shares were
outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as their
effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended September 30, 2003, debt
securities convertible into 31.1 million shares, stock options exercisable into 25.8
million shares and a warrant to purchase 1.0 million shares were outstanding but not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as the net loss for this period
would have made their effect anti-dilutive. For the year ended September 30, 2002, options
to purchase 31.3 million shares were outstanding but not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share as the net loss for this period would have made their effect
anti-dilutive.

Pensions and Retiree
Medical Benefits:

In
connection with Conexant’s spin-off of its Washington/Mexicali business, Conexant
transferred obligations to Washington/Mexicali for its pension plan and retiree benefits.
The amounts that were transferred relate to approximately twenty Washington/Mexicali
employees that had enrolled in Conexant’s Voluntary Early Retirement Plan
(“VERP”) in 1998. The VERP also provides health care benefits to members of the
plan. The Company currently does not offer pension plans or retiree benefits to its
employees.

The
costs and obligations of the Company’s pension and retiree medical plans are
calculated using many assumptions, the amount of which cannot be completely determined
until the benefit payments cease. The most significant assumptions, as presented in Note
11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, include discount rate, expected return on
plan assets and future trends in health care costs. The selection of assumptions is based
on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation.
Actual results may differ substantially from these assumptions. These differences may
significantly impact future pension or retiree medical expenses.

Annual
pension and retiree medical expense is principally the sum of three components: 1)
increase in liability from interest; less 2) expected return on plan assets; and 3) other
gains and losses as described below. The expected return on plan assets is calculated by
applying an assumed long-term rate of return to the fair value of plan assets. In any
given year, actual returns can differ significantly from the expected return. Differences
between the actual and expected return on plan assets are combined with gains or losses
resulting from the revaluation of plan liabilities. Plan liabilities are revalued
annually, based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by
the plan. The combined gain or loss is generally expensed evenly over the remaining years
that employees are expected to work.

Comprehensive Income
(Loss):

The
Company accounts for comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income.” SFAS No. 130 is a financial statement
presentation standard that requires the Company to disclose non-owner changes included in
equity but not included in net income or loss. Comprehensive loss presented in the
financial statements consists of adjustments to the Company’s minimum pension
liability.

NOTE 3.    BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Merger with Conexant Systems, Inc.'s Wireless Business

In
connection with the Merger, the Company identified duplicate facilities resulting in a
write-down of fixed assets with historical carrying values of $92.4 million to $20.2
million, a reduction in workforce of approximately 210 employees at a cost of $4.8 million
and facility exit or closing costs of $3.1 million. The effects of these actions are
reflected in the purchase price allocation below.

In
connection with the Merger, $65.5 million was allocated to purchased in-process research
and development and expensed immediately upon completion of the acquisition (as a charge
not deductible for tax purposes) because the technological feasibility of certain products
under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed.

The
material risks associated with the successful completion of the in-process technology were
associated with our ability to successfully finish the creation of viable prototypes and
successful design of the chips, masks and manufacturing processes required. We expected to
benefit from the in-process projects as the individual products that contained the
in-process technology were put into production and sold to end-users. The release dates
for each of the products within the product families were varied. The fair value of the
in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) was determined using the
income approach. Under the income approach, the fair value reflected the present value of
the projected cash flows that were expected to be generated by the products incorporating
the IPR&D, if successful. The projected cash flows were discounted to approximate fair
value. The discount rate applicable to the cash flows of each project reflected the stage
of completion and other risks inherent in each project. The weighted average discount rate
used in the valuation of IPR&D was 30 percent. The Company had either completed or
abandoned each of these projects prior to the completion of fiscal 2003. The completed
IPR&D projects commenced generating cash flows in fiscal 2003. Due to the nature of
these projects and the related technology, the revenue streams derived from these projects
cannot be separately identified. The Company decided to abandon the projects noted as such
below because of continuing technology problems, downturn in demand, major delays and
insufficient technical features for the competitive marketplace. The Company does not
believe that its decision to abandon any of the projects listed below individually or in
the aggregate had a material effect on its results of operations.

NOTE 6.    GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” on October
1, 2002, and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill. As a result,
management determined that the carrying amount of its goodwill was $397.1 million greater
than its implied fair value. This transitional impairment charge was recorded as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and is reflected in the
Company’s results of operations as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. The significant
impairment charge to goodwill shortly after the Merger resulted from a significant decline
in the market price of our common stock. The first step of the goodwill impairment
analysis compares the Company’s fair value to its net book value. In determining fair
value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies, although it
states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value. The Company hired a
third-party firm to perform the fair value calculation for the Merger and subsequent SFAS
142 valuation. The fair value calculation used to determine the purchase price for the
Merger was performed in December 2001, the date at which the principal terms of the Merger
were agreed upon by both parties. The calculation was based on the average market price of
the Company’s common stock over a seven-day period. This same methodology was used to
determine the fair value of the Company at October 1, 2002 for the required transitional
impairment test upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Between the time of the Merger
calculation in December 2001 and the SFAS No. 142 calculation in October 2002, the market
price of the Company’s common stock declined as the wireless semiconductor industry
experienced a downturn in demand amid concerns about inflation, decreased consumer
confidence, reduced capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns
in the telecommunications and related industries. Since the Company’s fair value is
directly linked to the market price of its common stock, a significant decline in the
market price of its common stock could, and in this case did, result in an impairment
charge to goodwill. The Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of the first
day of its fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating
that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. The Company completed its annual
goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2004 and determined that as of July 5, 2004, its
goodwill was not impaired.

The
deductions to goodwill in fiscal 2004 primarily reflect the recognition of a portion of
the deferred tax assets for which no benefit was previously recognized as of the date of
the Merger. The future realization of certain pre-Merger deferred tax assets will be
applied to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. The remaining portion of the valuation
allowance for these pre-Merger deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax
benefits may be applied to reduce goodwill is approximately $43.0 million at September 30,
2004.

The
additions (deductions) in fiscal 2003 primarily reflect income tax refunds and gains on
the sale of acquired assets related to Alpha and the acquisition of a tradename.
Impairment losses in fiscal 2003 represent the write-down of assets related to the
Company’s infrastructure business and are included in special charges in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

In
accordance with SFAS No. 142, the following table provides net loss and related per share

Junior notes represent the
Company’s 4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007. These Junior notes
can be converted into 110.4911 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal balance, which
is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately $9.05 per share. The Company may
redeem the Junior notes at any time after November 20, 2005. The redemption price of the
Junior notes during the period between November 20, 2005 through November 14, 2006, will
be $1,011.875 per $1,000 principal amount of notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the redemption date, and the redemption price of the notes beginning
on November 15, 2006, and thereafter will be $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of notes
to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Holders
may require the Company to repurchase the Junior notes upon a change in control of the
Company. The Company will pay interest in cash semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and
November 15 of each year.

Senior notes represented the
Company’s 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes due June 30, 2005, which
were issued as part of the Company’s debt refinancing with Conexant completed on
November 13, 2002. On April 22, 2004, the Company notified the holder of the senior notes
that it would redeem such notes in full on May 12, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the holder of the
senior notes converted such notes in full for approximately 5.7 million shares of the
Company’s common stock. The Company paid interest in cash on the senior notes on the
last business day of each March, June, September and December of each year. Interest paid
on the senior notes is not deductible for tax purposes because of the conversion feature.

The Company had a ten-year $960,000
loan from the State of Maryland under the Community Development Block Grant
(“CDBG”) program. Quarterly payments were due through December 2003, and
represented principal plus interest at five percent of the unamortized balance. The
Company paid this loan in full during the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

The charge in lieu of tax expense
resulted from partial recognition of certain acquired tax benefits that were subject to a
valuation allowance at the time of acquisition, the realization of which required a
reduction of goodwill.

Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities consist of the tax effects of temporary differences related to the following
(in thousands):

Based upon a history of significant
operating losses, management has determined that it is more likely than not that historic
and current year income tax benefits will not be realized except for certain future
deductions associated with the Mexicali Operations in the post-Merger period.
Consequently, no United States income tax benefit has been recognized relating to the U.S.
operating losses. As of September 30, 2004, the Company has established a valuation
allowance against all of its net U.S. deferred tax assets. The net change in the valuation
allowance of $2.5 million is principally due to the generation of additional tax
attributes, i.e. federal and state net operating loss and credit carryovers, reduced by
the utilization of other deferred tax assets. As noted above, during the year the Company
realized a portion of the acquired deferred tax assets that were subject to the valuation
allowance, which resulted in a reduction of goodwill. The remaining amount of these
deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be applied to
reduce goodwill related to the purchase consideration of the Merger with Alpha is
approximately $43 million. Deferred tax assets have been recognized for foreign operations
when management believes they will be recovered during the carry-forward period. The
Company does not expect to recognize any income tax benefits relating to future operating
losses generated in the United States until management determines that such benefits are
more likely than not to be realized.

In 2002, the Company recorded a tax
benefit of approximately $23 million related to the impairment of its Mexicali assets. A
valuation allowance has not been established because the Company believes that the related
deferred tax asset will be recovered during the carryforward period. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company reduced the carrying value of its deferred tax assets
by $3.5 million. This charge primarily originated from foreign currency translation errors
after establishing the aforementioned tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2002 for the
impairment of its Mexicali assets immediately following completion of the Merger. The
cumulative effect of these errors is being reported in the provision for income taxes line
of the statement of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, as it did not have a
material impact in prior periods. The aggregate $3.5 million charge listed by fiscal year
would be approximately $1.2 million, $2.0 million and $0.3 million for fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

As of September 30, 2004, the Company
has U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $187.1 million which
will expire at various dates through 2024 and aggregate state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $78.0 million which will expire at various dates through
2009. The Company also has U.S. federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $19.9 million. The U.S. federal tax credits expire at various dates through
2024. The use of the pre-Merger net operating loss and tax credit carryovers from Alpha
will be limited due to statutory tax restrictions resulting from the Merger and related
change in ownership. The annual limit on the utilization of pre-merger net operating
losses is approximately $14 million. Pre-Merger credits would also be subject to the tax
equivalent of the annual net operating loss limitation.

No provision has been made for United
States, state, or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately $16.7 million
of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be
permanently reinvested. It is not practical to determine the United States federal income
tax liability, if any, which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently
reinvested.

NOTE 9.     STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Prior to the Merger with Alpha,
Conexant’s wireless business had no separate capitalization. The following
information represents the Company’s capital structure following the Merger.

COMMON STOCK

The Company is authorized to issue
(1) 525,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.25 per share, and (2) 25,000,000
shares of preferred stock, without par value.

Holders of the Company’s common
stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by the Company’s Board of
Directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. Dividends may not be paid on
common stock unless all accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, have been paid or
declared and set aside. In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, the holders of common stock will be entitled to share pro rata in the assets
remaining after payment to creditors and after payment of the liquidation preference plus
any unpaid dividends to holders of any outstanding preferred stock.

Each holder of the Company’s
common stock is entitled to one vote for each such share outstanding in the holder’s
name. No holder of common stock is entitled to cumulate votes in voting for directors. The
Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that,
unless otherwise determined by the Company’s Board of Directors, no holder of common
stock has any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for any stock of any class which
the Company may issue or sell.

On August 11, 2003 the Company filed
a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) with respect to the issuance of up to $250 million aggregate principal
amount of securities, including debt securities, common or preferred shares, warrants or
any combination thereof. This registration statement, which the SEC declared effective on
August 28, 2003, provides the Company with greater flexibility and access to capital. On
September 9, 2003, the Company issued 9.2 million shares of common stock under its shelf
registration statement. The Company may from time to time issue securities under the
remaining balance of the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes.

At September 30, 2004, the Company
had 156,012,551 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

PREFERRED STOCK

The Company’s second amended and
restated certificate of incorporation permits the Company to issue up to 25,000,000 shares
of preferred stock in one or more series and with rights and preferences that may be fixed
or designated by the Company’s Board of Directors without any further action by the
Company’s stockholders. The designation, powers, preferences, rights and
qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the preferred stock of each series will be
fixed by the certificate of designation relating to such series, which will specify the
terms of the preferred stock.

At September 30, 2004, the Company
had no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.

STOCK OPTIONS

The Company has stock option plans under
which employees may be granted options to purchase common stock. Options are generally
granted with exercise prices at not less than the fair market value on the grant date,
generally vest over four years and expire ten years after the grant date. As of September
30, 2004, a total of 24.1 million shares are authorized for grant under the Company’s
long-term incentive plans. The number of common shares reserved for granting of future
awards was 5.7 million at September 30, 2004.

Pursuant to an exchange offer dated
June 16, 2003 (the “Exchange Offer”), the Company offered a stock option
exchange program to its employees, other than its executive officers under Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, giving them the right to tender
outstanding stock options with an exercise price of $13.00 per share or more in exchange
for new options to be issued six months and one day after the close of the Exchange Offer.
On July 3, 2003, the expiration date of the Company’s Exchange Offer, the Company
accepted for exchange from eligible employees options to purchase an aggregate of
approximately 5.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock. These stock options
were cancelled as of that date. Pursuant to the Exchange Offer, a ratio was applied to the
options accepted for exchange from eligible employees and on January 5, 2004, the Company
issued new options to purchase approximately 3.4 million shares of the Company’s
common stock with an exercise price at fair market value ($9.60) in exchange for the
options cancelled in connection with the offer. These new options vest ratably over an
eighteen-month period. The Exchange Offer qualifies for fixed accounting, and thus the
Company did not recognize compensation expense in connection with the grant of the
replacement options pursuant to the Exchange Offer.

In connection with Conexant’s
spin-off of Washington, options to purchase shares of Conexant common stock were adjusted
so that immediately following the spin-off, option holders held options to purchase shares
of Conexant common stock and options to purchase Washington common stock. In connection
with the Merger, those options to purchase shares of Washington common stock were
converted into options to purchase the Company’s common stock, par value $0.25 per
share. The terms of options to purchase the Company’s common stock will be governed
by the Washington Sub, Inc. 2002 Stock Option Plan, which was assumed by Skyworks in the
Merger and which provides that such options will generally have the same terms and
conditions applicable to the original Conexant options. These options are included in the
following schedules and options related to non-employees are disclosed separately below.

As of September 30, 2004, the
Company’s ratio of options outstanding as a percentage of total common stock
outstanding (“overhang”) was 20.3%. The overhang attributable to options held by
non-employees (other than its non-employee directors) was 6.8% and the overhang
attributable to employees and directors was 13.5%.

In connection with the Merger, as of
September 30, 2004 and 2003, non-employees, excluding directors, held 10,662,628 and
14,351,737 options at a weighted average price of $20.44 and $16.76, respectively.
Effective June 25, 2002, in connection with the Merger, each Conexant option holder, other
than holders of options granted to employees of Conexant’s former Mindspeed
Technologies segment on March 30, 2001 and options held by persons in certain foreign
locations, received an option to purchase an equal number of shares of common stock of the
Washington subsidiary. In the Merger, each outstanding Washington option was converted
into an option to purchase Skyworks common stock. The conversion of Washington options
into Skyworks’ options was done in such a manner that (1) the aggregate
intrinsic value of the options immediately before and after the conversion was the same,
(2) the ratio of the exercise price per option to the market value per option was not
reduced, and (3) the vesting provisions and options period of the Skyworks’
options were the same as the original vesting terms and option period of the corresponding
Washington options. As a result, there are a large number of options held by persons other
than Skyworks’ employees and directors.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

The Company’s long-term
incentive plans provide for awards of restricted shares of common stock and other
stock-based incentive awards to officers and other employees and certain non-employees.
Restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates during the
prescribed retention period (generally within two years of the date of award) or, in
certain cases, if prescribed performance criteria are not met. The fair value of
restricted stock awards is charged to expense over the vesting period. There were no
restricted stock grants during fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002.

STOCK OPTION PLANS FOR
DIRECTORS

The Company has three stock option
plans for non-employee directors — the 1994 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, the 1997
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan and the Directors’ 2001 Stock Option Plan. Under the
three plans, a total of 826,000 shares have been authorized for option grants. The three
plans have substantially similar terms and conditions and are structured to provide
options to non-employee directors as follows: a new director receives a total of 45,000
options upon becoming a member of the Board; and continuing directors receive 15,000
options after each Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Under these plans, the option price is
the fair market value at the time the option is granted. Beginning in fiscal 2001, all
options granted become exercisable 25% per year beginning one year from the date of grant.
Options granted prior to fiscal 2001 become exercisable at a rate of 20% per year
beginning one year from the date of grant. During fiscal 2004, 150,000 options were
granted under these plans at a weighted average price of $9.44. At September 30, 2004, a
total of 699,000 options, net of cancellations, at a weighted average price of $10.81 have
been granted under these three plans and 306,000 shares were exercisable at a weighted
average price of $12.46. During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, no options were exercised
under these plans. Non-employee directors of the Company are also eligible to receive
option grants under the Company’s 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE
PLAN

The Company maintains a domestic and
an international employee stock purchase plan. Under these plans, eligible employees may
purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of compensation. The price
per share is the lower of 85% of the market price at the beginning or end of each
six-month offering period. The plans provide for purchases by employees of up to an
aggregate of 1,880,000 shares through December 31, 2012. Shares of common stock purchased
under these plans in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 616,760, 704,921 and 65,668,
respectively. The Company did not recognize compensation expense under these plans in
fiscal 2004, 2003 or 2002.

STOCK WARRANTS

In connection with the Merger, the
Company issued to Jazz Semiconductor, Inc. (“Jazz Semiconductor”) a warrant to
purchase 1,017,900 shares of Skyworks common stock at a price of $24.02 per share. This
warrant became exercisable in increments of 25% as of June 25, 2002, March 11, 2003,
September 11, 2003 and March 11, 2004. Jazz Semiconductor has not exercised any portion of
the warrant as of September 30, 2004. The Company applied the Black-Scholes model to
determine the fair value estimate and approximately $0.8 million, $0.8 million and $0.2
million was included in amortization of intangible assets related to this item in fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The warrant expires on January 20, 2005.

NOTE 10.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

The Company maintains a 401(k) plan
covering substantially all of its employees. All of the Company’s employees who are
at least 21 years old are eligible to receive a Company contribution. Discretionary
Company contributions are determined by the Board of Directors and may be in the form of
cash or the Company’s stock. The Company contributes a match of 100% of the first 4%
of an employee’s annual salary. For fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company
contributed 392,744, 560,516 and 128,836 shares, respectively, of the Company’s
common stock valued at $3.6 million, $4.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, to fund
the Company’s obligation under the 401(k) plan.

Conexant sponsored various benefit
plans for its eligible employees, including a 401(k) retirement savings plan, a retirement
medical plan and a pension plan. Expenses allocated from Conexant under these employee
benefit plans for Washington/Mexicali participants prior to the Merger was $1.0 million
for fiscal year 2002.

NOTE 11.    PENSIONS AND OTHER RETIREE BENEFITS

In connection with Conexant’s
spin-off of its Washington/Mexicali business, Conexant transferred obligations to
Washington/Mexicali for its pension plan and retiree benefits. The amounts that were
transferred relate to approximately twenty Washington/Mexicali employees that had enrolled
in Conexant’s Voluntary Early Retirement Plan (“VERP”) in 1998. The VERP
also provides health care benefits to members of the plan. The Company currently does not
offer pension plans or retiree benefits to its employees.

The Company measures its plan assets
and benefit obligations for its pension benefit plan and retiree medical benefit plan as
of June 30th for each fiscal year. During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, the Company
allocated approximately 60% of its plan assets for the pension benefit plan and the
retiree medical benefit plan to equity securities and the remaining 40% of plan assets
were allocated to debt securities. The Company plans to continue utilizing this allocation
of plan assets as its investment policy.

The Company expects to contribute
approximately $0.3 million to the pension benefit plan in fiscal 2005. The Company’s
expected benefit payments as of September 30, 2004 were $0.3 million for each fiscal year
through 2009 and $1.2 million in the aggregate for fiscal 2010 through 2014.

During fiscal 2004, the health care cost
trend rate assumed for next year was 11% and was expected to decline by 0.5% each year
until reaching the ultimate trend rate of 5.5% in fiscal 2016. An increase in the health
care cost trend rate by 1% would increase the accumulated retirement medical obligation by
$0.1 million at September 30, 2004, and would not affect retirement medical expense.
Consequently, a decrease in the health care cost trend rate by 1% would decrease the
accumulated retirement medical obligation by $0.1 million at September 30, 2004, and would
not affect retirement medical expense.

NOTE 12.    COMMITMENTS

The Company has various operating
leases primarily for computer equipment and buildings. Rent expense amounted to $9.8
million, $10.4 million and $7.1 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Purchase options may be exercised, at fair market value, at various times for some of
these leases. Future minimum payments under these noncancelable leases are as follows (in
thousands):

Under supply agreements entered into
with Conexant and subsequently with Jazz Semiconductor, the Company receives wafer
fabrication, wafer probe and certain other services from Jazz Semiconductor.

Pursuant to the terms of these
agreements, the Company is committed to obtaining certain minimum wafer volumes from Jazz
Semiconductor through March 2005. The Company’s expected minimum purchase obligations
under these supply agreements will be approximately $12.9 million in fiscal 2005. The
Company currently anticipates meeting each of the annual minimum purchase obligations
under these supply agreements.

In addition, the Company entered into
licensing agreements for intellectual property rights and maintenance and support services
during fiscal 2004. Pursuance to the terms of these agreements, the Company is committed
to aggregate payments of $3.2 million and $3.0 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006,
respectively.

NOTE 13.    CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, various lawsuits,
claims and proceedings have been, and may in the future be, instituted or asserted against
the Company, including those pertaining to patent infringement, intellectual property,
environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment and contractual matters.
In addition, in connection with the Merger, the Company has assumed responsibility for all
then current and future litigation (including environmental and intellectual property
proceedings) against Conexant or its subsidiaries in respect of the operations of
Conexant’s wireless business. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the
Company. Intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief which, if
imposed against the Company, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations.

Additionally, the semiconductor
industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property
rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert
patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that
are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we
license their technology. At the present time, the Company is in litigation with Qualcomm
Incorporated (“Qualcomm”) regarding claims that both the Company and Qualcomm
filed and first served against each other on December 4, 2003 asserting violations of
certain of each company’s respective intellectual property rights. The Company
believes Qualcomm’s claims are without merit and is vigorously defending against
Qualcomm’s claims and fully prosecuting its claims against them.

NOTE 14.    GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES

The Company does not currently have
any guarantees. The Company generally indemnifies its customers from third-party
intellectual property infringement litigation claims related to its products. In
connection with certain facility leases, the Company has indemnified its lessors for
certain claims arising from the facility or the lease. The Company indemnifies its
directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of
Delaware. The duration of the indemnities varies, and in many cases is indefinite. The
indemnities to customers in connection with product sales generally are subject to limits
based upon the amount of the related product sales and in many cases are subject to
geographic and other restrictions. In certain instances, the Company’s indemnities do
not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments the Company could
be obligated to make. The Company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Special charges consists of charges
for asset impairments and restructuring activities, as follows:

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

During the second quarter of fiscal 2004,
the Company recorded a $13.2 million charge primarily related to the impairment of
obsolete baseband technology licenses that were established prior to the Merger. This
charge includes approximately $1.8 million of contractual payment obligations, which the
Company expects to pay within one year. The impairment charge was based on a
recoverability analysis prepared by management based on the decision to discontinue
certain products and the related impact on its current and projected outlook. Management
believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets (intangible
assets, machinery and equipment) were impaired and that an impairment analysis should be
performed. In performing the analysis for recoverability, management estimated the future
cash flows expected to result from these products (salvage value). Since the estimated
undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets, it was
concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized. In accordance with SFAS No. 144
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the impairment
charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their
carrying value. The write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003, the Company recorded a $26.0 million charge for the impairment of assets related to
certain infrastructure products manufactured in its Woburn, Massachusetts and Adamstown,
Maryland facilities. The Woburn facility primarily manufactures semiconductor products
based on both silicon wafer technology and gallium arsenide technology. The Company’s
Adamstown, Maryland facility primarily manufactures ceramics components. The Company
experienced a significant decline in factory utilization resulting from a downturn in the
market for products manufactured at these two facilities and a decision to discontinue
certain products. The impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by
management based on these factors and the related impact on its current and projected
outlook. The Company projected lower revenues and new order volume for these products and
management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets
(machinery, equipment and intangible assets) may have been impaired and that an impairment
analysis should be performed. In performing the analysis for recoverability, management
estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products over a five-year
period. Since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of
the related assets, it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized. In
accordance with SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value
of the related assets to their carrying value. The fair value of the assets was determined
by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of
16%, which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with
the projected future cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used in the
discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the
assets. The write-down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets.

In addition, during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded a $2.3 million charge for the impairment of
its Haverhill, Massachusetts property currently being held for sale. In fiscal 2003, the
Company relocated its operations from this facility to its Woburn, Massachusetts facility.
In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a $2.3 million charge
for the impairment of our Haverhill, Massachusetts property. The Company actively marketed
the property located in Haverhill, Massachusetts and in March 2004, the Company entered
into a contractual agreement for the sale of the property, contingent upon obtaining
specific regulatory approvals within the next two years.

During fiscal 2002, the Company
recorded a $66.0 million charge for the impairment of the assembly and test machinery and
equipment and related facility in Mexicali, Mexico. The impairment charge was based on a
recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of a significant downturn in
the market for test and assembly services for non-wireless products and the related impact
on the Company’s current and projected outlook.

The Company experienced a severe
decline in factory utilization at its Mexicali facility for non-wireless products and
projected decreasing revenues and new order volume. Management believed these factors
indicated that the carrying value of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and
related facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be
performed. In performing the analysis for recoverability, management estimated the future
cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the Mexicali facility
over a ten-year period. The estimated future cash flows were based on a gradual phase-out
of services sold to Conexant and modest volume increases consistent with management’s
view of the outlook for the business, partially offset by declining average selling
prices. The declines in average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and
management’s decision to reduce capital expenditures for future capacity expansion.
Since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value
(approximately $100 million based on historical cost) of the related assets, it was
concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized. The impairment charge was
determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying
value. The fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the
estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 24%, which management believed was
commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows.
Management believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a
reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets. The write-down established a new cost
basis for the impaired assets.

During fiscal 2002, the Company
recorded a $45.8 million charge for the write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets
associated with its acquisition of Philsar Semiconductor Inc. (“Philsar”) in
fiscal 2000. Philsar was a developer of radio frequency semiconductor solutions for
personal wireless connectivity, including emerging standards such as Bluetooth, and radio
frequency components for third-generation digital cellular handsets. Management determined
that the Company would not support the technology associated with the Philsar Bluetooth
business. Accordingly, this product line was discontinued and the employees associated
with the product line were either severed or relocated to other operations. As a result of
the actions taken, management determined that the remaining goodwill and other intangible
assets associated with the Philsar acquisition were impaired.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

2004 Corporate
Restructuring Plan

During fiscal 2004, the Company
consolidated cellular systems software design centers in an effort to improve the
Company’s overall time to market for next-generation multimedia systems development.
These actions aligned the Company’s structure with its current business environment.
The Company implemented reductions in force at three remote facilities and recorded
restructuring charges of approximately $4.2 million for costs related to severance
benefits for affected employees and lease obligations. Substantially all amounts accrued
for these actions are expected to be paid within one year.

During fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002,
the Company recorded $6.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in restructuring charges
to provide for workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities. The charges were
based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for affected employees and lease
cancellation, facility sales, and other costs related to the consolidation of facilities.
As of September 30, 2004, substantially all amounts accrued for these actions have been
paid and the remaining amounts are expected to be paid within one year.

Activity and liability balances
related to the fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 restructuring actions are as follows (in
thousands):

Pre-Merger Alpha
Restructuring Plan

In addition, the Company assumed
approximately $7.8 million of restructuring reserves from Alpha in connection with the
Merger. During fiscal 2004 and the fiscal years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002,
payments related to the restructuring reserves assumed from Alpha were $0.2 million, $4.7
million and $1.1 million, respectively. In addition, the Company reduced this
restructuring reserve by approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2004 primarily related to a
reduction in facility closure costs. This reduction of expenses is reflected in the
special charges line of the Company’s results of operations. As of September 30,
2004, the restructuring reserve balance related to Alpha was $1.3 million and primarily
relates to estimated future payments on a lease that expires in 2008.

NOTE 16.    SEGMENT INFORMATION AND CONCENTRATIONS

The Company follows SFAS No. 131,
“Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” SFAS No.
131 establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about
operating segments in annual financial statements and in interim reports to shareholders.
The method for determining what information to report is based on the way that management
organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing
financial performance. In evaluating financial performance, management uses sales and
operating profit as the measure of the segments’ profit or loss. Based on the
guidance in SFAS No. 131, the Company has one operating segment for financial reporting
purposes.

The Company operates in one business
segment, which designs, develops, manufactures and markets proprietary semiconductor
products and system solutions for manufacturers of wireless communication products.

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Net revenues by geographic area are
presented based upon the country of destination. Net revenues by geographic area are as
follows (in thousands):

The Company’s revenues by
geography do not necessarily correlate to end handset demand by region. For example, if
the Company sells a power amplifier module to a customer in South Korea, the sale is
recorded within the South Korea account although that customer, in turn, may integrate
that module into a product sold to a service provider (its customer) in Africa, China,
Europe, the Middle East, the Americas or within South Korea.

The significant growth in net
revenues derived from China in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 when compared to the previous
fiscal years reflects the Company’s market share gains across a number of domestic
cellular handset suppliers in the region and primarily represents sales of complete
cellular systems, DCR transceivers and front-end modules.

Geographic property, plant and
equipment balances, including property held for sale, are based on the physical locations
within the indicated geographic areas and are as follows (in thousands):

CONCENTRATIONS

Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of
trade accounts receivable. Trade receivables are primarily derived from sales to
manufacturers of communications and consumer products. Ongoing credit evaluations of
customers’ financial condition are performed and collateral, such as letters of
credit and bank guarantees, are required whenever deemed necessary. As of September 30,
2004 Motorola, Inc. represented approximately 12% and Samsung Electronics Co. and RTI
International each accounted for approximately 10% of the Company’s gross accounts
receivable. Samsung Electronics, Co. accounted for 18% of the Company’s gross
accounts receivable balance at September 30, 2003.

The following customers accounted for
10% or more of net revenues:

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
               Assets,” on October 1, 2002 and recorded a charge for the cumulative effect
               of a change in accounting principle of $397.1 million, which is reflected in the
               above table as of the beginning of fiscal 2003.

(2)

Earnings per share calculations for each of the quarters are based on the
               weighted average number of shares outstanding and included common stock
               equivalents in each period. Therefore, the sums of the quarters do not
               necessarily equal the full year earnings per share.

(3)

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company reduced the carrying value
               of its deferred tax assets by $3.5 million. This charge primarily originated
               from foreign exchange translation errors after establishing the $23.1 million
               tax benefit recorded in fiscal 2002 for the impairment of the Company’s
               assembly and test machinery and equipment in Mexicali, Mexico immediately
               following completion of the Merger. The cumulative effect of these errors is
               being reported in the provision for income taxes line of the statement of
               operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, as it did not have a material
               impact in prior periods. The aggregate $3.5 million charge and the effect on
               earnings per share, if any, are listed in the following table.

ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report (the “Evaluation
Date”). Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to the material information relating
to us (or our consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in our periodic SEC
filings. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

There were no changes made in our
internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30,
2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

The values of  unexercised  options in the  foregoing  table are based on the  difference  between the $9.99 closing price of Skyworks'
common stock on October 1, 2004, the end of the 2004 fiscal year, on the Nasdaq  National  Market,  and the respective  option exercise
price.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS

There were no long-term incentive awards granted to any of the Named Executives in fiscal 2004.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Our executives are eligible for awards of nonqualified  stock options,  incentive  stock options and restricted  stock awards under our
applicable  stock option plans.  These stock option plans are  administered  by the  Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors.
Generally,  the exercise price at which an executive may purchase  Skyworks' common stock pursuant to a stock option is the fair market
value of  Skyworks'  common  stock on the date of grant.  Stock  options are granted  subject to  restrictions  on vesting,  with equal
portions of the total grant generally  vesting over a period of four years. Our stock options are subject to forfeiture  (after certain
grace  periods) upon  termination  of  employment,  retirement,  disability or death.  Restricted  stock awards involve the issuance of
shares of common stock that may not be transferred  or otherwise  encumbered,  subject to certain  exceptions,  for varying  amounts of
time, and which will be forfeited, in whole or in part, if the executive terminates his or her employment with Skyworks.

The Named Executives were also eligible to receive target  incentive  compensation  under which a percentage of each executive's  total
cash compensation is tied to the accomplishment of specific  financial  objectives during fiscal year 2004. The Company did achieve the
annual performance  targets set by the Board of Directors,  and the incentive bonuses were paid to the Named Executives with respect to
fiscal year 2004 and are  reflected  in the  "Summary  Compensation  Table".  Certain  Named  Executives  also may  participate  in the
Company's Executive  Compensation Plan (the "Executive  Compensation  Plan"), an unfunded,  non-qualified  deferred  compensation plan,
under  which  participants  may defer a  portion  of their  compensation.  Deferred  amounts  are held in a trust.  Participants  defer
recognizing  taxable income on the amount held for their benefit until the amounts are paid. The Company,  in its sole discretion,  may
make additional contributions to the accounts of participants. Participants normally receive the deferred amounts upon retirement.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

Directors  who are not  employees  of Skyworks  are paid a quarterly  retainer  of $7,500 plus an  additional  $1,000 for each Board of
Directors  meeting  attended in person or $500 for each Board of  Directors  meeting  attended by  telephone.  Effective  for the first
quarter of fiscal 2005,  the Chairman of the Board of Directors  will be paid a quarterly  retainer of $11,250.  Directors who serve as
chairman  of a  committee  of the Board of  Directors  receive  an  additional  quarterly  retainer  of $625,  and those who serve on a
committee but are not chairman  receive an additional  quarterly  retainer of $312.50.  Effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2005,
the Chairman of the Audit  Committee will be paid an additional  quarterly  retainer of $2,250 and the Chairman of the  Compensation  Committee
will be paid an additional  quarterly  retainer of $1,500. In addition,  effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2005,  directors who
serve on the Audit  Committee  but are not Chairman will be paid an  additional  quarterly  retainer of $750 and directors who serve on
the Compensation  Committee but are not Chairman will be paid an additional quarterly retainer of $500. Each new non-employee  director
receives  an option to purchase  45,000  shares of common  stock  immediately  following  the earlier of  Skyworks'  annual  meeting of
stockholders  at which the  director  is first  elected by the  stockholders  or  following  his  initial  appointment  by the Board of
Directors.  Additionally,  following  each annual  meeting of  stockholders  each  director who is  continuing  in office or re-elected
receives an option to purchase  15,000 shares of common  stock.  The exercise  price of stock options  granted to directors is equal to
the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.  During  fiscal year 2001 and prior years,  option  grants to directors
were made from the 1994 and 1997  Non-Qualified  Stock Option Plans for  Non-Employee  Directors.  Stock option grants to directors for
fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004 were made under the 2001 Directors' Stock Option Plan.

In  connection  with the Merger of the wireless  business of Conexant  with  Skyworks,  Conexant  option  holders  received  options to
purchase shares of Skyworks  common stock pursuant to the Washington Sub, Inc. 2002 Stock Option Plan (the  "Washington Sub Plan") with
the same vesting  provisions and terms as the original  Conexant options from which they were derived.  Following the Merger,  Conexant
extended the  expiration  date of certain  Conexant  options  granted to Mr. Donald Beall,  one of our directors and also a director of
Conexant,  until ten years after the original date of grant of the Conexant  options.  We were informed by Conexant that the failure to
extend these Conexant  options prior to the Merger  resulted from an  administrative  error.  In November 2002, our Board of Directors,
acting upon a request from Conexant to make a  corresponding  adjustment to Mr.  Beall's  derivative  Skyworks  options to assist it in
correcting this prior  administrative  error,  extended the expiration dates of an aggregate of 310,268  derivative options to purchase
Skyworks common stock held by Mr. Beall under the Washington Sub Plan. Mr. Beall's  options were extended so that,  instead of expiring
on June 30, 2003,  such options would continue to be exercisable  until the tenth  anniversary of their original grant on dates ranging
from December 2004 to December 2006. In accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,  and FASB  Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain  Transactions  Involving Stock  Compensation,  the extension of Mr.
Beall's  options as noted above did not affect the  Company's  financial  statements  because the  exercise  price for such options was
higher than the market price of the Company's  stock at the  modification  date.  Therefore,  the intrinsic  value of the stock options
was zero at the date of the  modification,  and no additional  compensation cost resulted.  In addition,  fixed stock option accounting
continues to apply to Mr.  Beall's  stock  options  because  neither the number of stock  options nor the  exercise  price of the stock
options was changed as a result of the  modification.  None of the  Company's  stock option  plans was  affected by the  aforementioned
modification.

In  connection  with his  appointment  to the Board of Directors,  Mr. Beebe was granted an option to purchase  45,000 shares of common
stock on January 27,  2004,  at an exercise  price  equal to the fair market  value of the common  stock on the date of grant under our
Directors' 2001 Stock Option Plan.

In connection with their continued service on the Board of Directors,  each of Messrs.  Beall, Beebe,  Beguwala,  Decker,  Furey, Iyer,
Leonard and McLachlan  were granted an option to purchase  15,000 shares of common stock on March 30, 2004, at an exercise  price equal
to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.

SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS

The Company currently has severance agreements with Messrs.  Aldrich,  Barber, Kline and Waters under which each is entitled to receive
certain  benefits in the event that his employment is terminated  following a change in control of the Company,  or, with the exception
of Messrs.  Kline and Waters,  if their  employment is terminated by the Company  without  cause.  In the case of Mr.  Aldrich,  he may
receive  salary and bonus  payments and certain  benefits for up to two years.  In the case of Mr.  Barber,  he may receive  salary and
certain  benefits  for up to  eighteen  (18)  months.  In the case of Messrs.  Kline and Waters,  each may  receive  salary and certain
benefits for up to one year.  Furthermore,  with respect to Mr.  Aldrich,  all of his stock  options  will vest  immediately  upon such
termination.  Mr.  Aldrich's  severance  agreement  provides that he is also entitled to various  benefits in the event he  voluntarily
terminates his employment for certain reasons.  Whereas the severance  provisions for Mr. Aldrich are indefinite,  these provisions for
Messrs. Barber, Kline and Waters expire over the next year.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

The Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors comprises Messrs. Beebe, Furey and McLachlan.  No member of this committee was at
any time  during the past  fiscal year an officer or  employee  of the  Company,  was  formerly an officer of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries,  or had any employment  relationship with the Company. No "compensation  committee interlocks" existed during fiscal year
2004.

ITEM 12.     SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

To the Company's  knowledge,  the following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of the Company's common stock as of November 26,
2004, by the following  individuals or entities:  (i) each person who  beneficially  owns 5% or more of the  outstanding  shares of the
Company's  common  stock as of November 26, 2004;  (ii) the Named  Executives  (as defined  herein under the heading  "Compensation  of
Executive  Officers");  (iii) each  director and nominee for  director;  and (iv) all current  executive  officers and directors of the
Company, as a group.

Beneficial  ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange  Commission ("SEC"). As of November 26,
2004, there were 156,259,428 shares of Skyworks common stock issued and outstanding.

In computing the number of shares of Company common stock beneficially  owned by a person and the percentage  ownership of that person,
shares of Company  common stock that will be subject to stock options held by that person that are currently  exercisable  or that will
become exercisable within 60 days of November 26, 2004, are deemed outstanding.  These shares are not, however,  deemed outstanding for
the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

1999 EMPLOYEE LONG-TERM
INCENTIVE PLAN

The purposes of the Company’s
1999 Employee Long-term Incentive Plan (the “1999 Employee Plan”) are (i) to
provide long-term incentives and rewards to those employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries, other than officers and non-employee directors, who are in a position to
contribute to the long-term success and growth of the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii)
to assist the Company in retaining and attracting employees with requisite experience and
ability, and (iii) to associate more closely the interests of such employees with those of
the Company’s stockholders. The 1999 Employee Plan provides for the grant of
non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The
term of these options may not exceed ten years. The 1999 Employee Plan contains provisions
which permit restrictions on vesting or transferability, as well as continued
exercisability upon a participant’s termination of employment with the Company, of
options granted thereunder. The 1999 Employee Plan provides for full acceleration of the
vesting of options granted thereunder upon a “change in control” of the Company,
as defined in the 1999 Employee Plan. The Board of Directors generally may amend, suspend
or terminate the 1999 Employee Plan in whole or in part at any time; provided that any
amendment which affects outstanding options be consented to by the holder of the options.

WASHINGTON SUB, INC. 2002
STOCK OPTION PLAN

The Washington Sub, Inc. 2002 Stock
Option Plan (the “Washington Sub Plan”) became effective on June 25, 2002, in
connection with the Merger. At the time of the spin-off of Conexant’s wireless
business, outstanding Conexant options granted pursuant to certain Conexant stock
incentive plans were converted so that following the spin-off and Merger each holder of
those certain Conexant options held (i) options to purchase shares of Conexant common
stock and (ii) options to purchase shares of Skyworks common stock. The purpose of the
Washington Sub Plan is to provide a means for the Company to perform its obligations with
respect to these converted stock options. The only participants in the Washington Sub Plan
are those persons who, at the time of the Merger, held outstanding options granted
pursuant to certain Conexant stock option plans. No further options to purchase shares of
Skyworks common stock will be granted under the Washington Sub Plan. The Washington Sub
Plan contains a number of sub-plans, which contain terms and conditions that are
applicable to certain portions of the options subject to the Washington Sub Plan,
depending upon the Conexant stock option plan from which the Skyworks options granted
under the Washington Sub Plan were derived. The outstanding options under the Washington
Sub Plan generally have the same terms and conditions as the original Conexant options
from which they are derived. Most of the sub-plans of the Washington Sub Plan contain
provisions related to the effect of a participant’s termination of employment with
the Company, if any, and/or with Conexant on options granted pursuant to such sub-plan.
Several of the sub-plans under the Washington Sub Plan contain specific provisions related
to a change in control of the Company.

NON-QUALIFIED ESPP

The Company also maintains a
Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan to provide employees of the Company and
participating subsidiaries with an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the
Company through the purchase, by means of payroll deductions, of shares of the
Company’s common stock at a discount from the market price of the common stock at the
time of purchase. The Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan is intended for use
primarily by employees of the Company located outside the United States. Under the plan,
eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of
compensation. The price per share is the lower of 85% of the market price at the beginning
or end of each six-month offering period.
