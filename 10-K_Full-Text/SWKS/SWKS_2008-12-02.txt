PART l

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (“Skyworks” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets a broad
range of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors that enable wireless connectivity.
Our power amplifiers (PAs), front-end modules (FEMs) and integrated radio frequency (RF) solutions
can be found in many of the cellular handsets sold by the world’s leading manufacturers. Leveraging
our core analog technologies, we also offer a diverse portfolio of linear integrated circuits (ICs)
that support automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, industrial and medical applications.

We have aligned our product portfolio around two markets: mobile platforms and linear products. Our
mobile platform solutions include highly customized PAs, FEMs, and integrated RF transceivers that
are at the heart of many of today’s leading-edge multimedia handsets. Our primary customers for
these products include top-tier handset manufacturers such as Sony Ericsson, Motorola, Samsung, LG
Electronics and Research in Motion. In parallel, we offer over 900 different catalogue linear
products to a highly diversified non-handset customer base. Our linear products are typically
precision analog integrated circuits that target markets in cellular infrastructure,



broadband networking, medical, automotive and industrial applications, among others.
Representative linear products include synthesizers, mixers, switches, diodes and RF receivers. Our
primary customers for linear products include Ericsson, Huawei, Cisco, Nokia-Siemens,

Alcatel ·Lucent, and ZTE, as well as leading distributors such as Avnet.

We are a leader in the PA and FEM market for cellular handsets, and plan to build upon our position
by continuing to develop more highly integrated and higher performance products necessary for the
next generation of multimedia handsets. Our competitors in the mobile platforms market include RF
Micro Devices, Anadigics and TriQuint Semiconductor. In the linear products market, we plan to
continue to grow by both expanding distribution of our standard components and by leveraging our
core analog technologies to develop integrated products for specific customer applications. Our
competitors in the linear products market include Analog Devices, Hittite Microwave, Linear
Technology and Maxim Integrated Products.

Skyworks
Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed through the merger of the wireless business of
Conexant Systems, Inc., and Alpha Industries, Inc., on June 25, 2002.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

We believe there are two major trends in the wireless industry that are shaping the market
landscape and the way in which original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) engage semiconductor
suppliers. First, there is a market share consolidation underway. By virtually all analyst
estimates, approximately 80 percent of the handset market is now controlled by the five largest
OEMs, who are increasingly leveraging their brand, manufacturing and distribution advantages across
network carriers worldwide.

Second, and perhaps even more dramatic, is the convergence of multimedia-rich mobile platforms and
the increasingly important role of multimode FEMs in the rapidly evolving wireless handset market
— particularly as the industry shifts to 3G technology enabling applications such as Web browsing, video streaming, gaming, MP3
players and cameras. In fact, next generation EDGE, WEDGE and WCDMA
wireless platforms will soon become the majority of the more than one billion cellular phones the
industry is expected to produce annually. With this accelerating trend, the complexity in the FEM increases
as each new operating frequency band requires additional amplifier, filtering and switching content
to support:

•

backward compatibility to existing networks,

•

simultaneous transmission of voice and data,

•

international roaming, and

•

broadband functionality to accommodate music, video, data, and other multimedia
features.



Convergence of Multimedia in Mobile Platforms

Further, given constraints on handset size and power consumption, these complex modules must remain
physically small, energy efficient and cost effective, while also managing an unprecedented level
of potential signal interference within the handset. As a result, addressable semiconductor content
within the transmit and receive chain portion of the cellular handset is expected to more than
double over the next several years, creating an incremental market opportunity measured in billions
of dollars during that time.

Meanwhile,
outside of the handset market, wireless technologies are rapidly
proliferating as they tend to be the critical link between the analog and digital worlds. Precision analog technology allows for
the detection, measurement, amplification and conversion of temperature, pressure and audio
information into the digital realm. According to independent market research, the total available
market for the analog semiconductor segment is expected to approach $45 billion in 2011. Today,
this adjacent analog semiconductor market, which is characterized by longer product lifecycles and
relatively high gross margins, is fragmented and diversified among various end-markets, customer
bases and applications.



Select Analog End Markets

SKYWORKS’ STRATEGY

Skyworks’ vision is to become the leading supplier of high performance analog and mixed signal
semiconductors enabling mobile connectivity. Key elements in our strategy include:

Diversifying into Adjacent Linear Markets of Skyworks

By leveraging core analog, mixed signal and RF technology, Skyworks is also able to deliver
solutions to broader and diverse markets that are characterized by longer product lifecycles,
sustained revenue profiles and higher contribution margins than our handset business. While the
addressable market for linear products is highly fragmented, it is significantly larger than the
cellular handset RF industry.

Expanding Power Amplifier and Front-End Solutions Market Share

Our products offer customers solutions that significantly
speed time-to-market while significantly
reducing bill of material costs, power consumption and footprints. We plan to increase our current
worldwide market share position through higher levels of integration and continued innovation,
leveraging our leading–edge process and packaging technologies.

Capturing Increasing Dollar Content in Third and Fourth Generation Applications

As the industry migrates to multi-mode EDGE, WEDGE, WCDMA and WiMAX architectures, RF complexity in
the transmit and receive chain substantially increases given simultaneous voice and high speed data
communications requirements, coupled with the need for backward compatibility to existing networks.
As a result, we believe the addressable market for our solutions will more than double over the next several years.



Partnering with the World’s Leading Baseband Suppliers

As a result of exiting the baseband business at the end of fiscal 2006, we are now effectively
partnering with, rather than competing against, system-level developers. We believe these strategic
relationships will enhance our competitive position as the market migrates to 3G multimode and
system-on-a-chip architectures where best-in-class baseband, radio and front-end solutions are
increasingly required.

Delivering Operational Excellence

Skyworks’ strategy is to vertically integrate where we can differentiate or otherwise enter
alliances and partnerships for leading-edge capabilities. These partnerships and alliances are
designed to ensure product leadership and competitive advantage in the marketplace. We are focused
on achieving the industry’s shortest cycle times, highest yields and ultimately the lowest product
cost structure.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

Our products are primarily sold through a direct Skyworks sales force. This team is globally
deployed across all major market regions. In some markets we supplement our direct sales effort
with independent manufacturers’ representatives, assuring broader coverage of territories and
customers. We also utilize distribution partners, some of which are franchised globally with others
focused in specific regional markets (e.g., Europe, North America, China and Taiwan).

We maintain an internal marketing organization that is responsible for developing sales and
advertising literature, print media, such as product announcements and catalogs, as well as a
variety of Web-based content. Skyworks’ sales engagement begins at the earliest stages in a
customer design. We strive to provide close technical collaboration with our customers at the
inception of a new program. This relationship allows our team to facilitate customer-driven
solutions, which leverage the unique strength of our product portfolio while providing high value and
greatly reducing time-to-market.

We believe that the technical and complex nature of our products and markets demand an
extraordinary commitment to maintain intimate ongoing relationships with our customers. As such, we
strive to expand the scope of our customer relationship to include design, engineering,
manufacturing, purchasing and project management. We also employ a collaborative approach in
developing these relationships by combining the support of our design teams, applications engineers,
manufacturing personnel, sales and marketing staff and senior management.

We believe that maintaining frequent and interactive contact with our customers is paramount to our
continuous efforts to provide world-class sales and service support. By listening and responding to
feedback, we are able to mobilize resources to raise the level of customer satisfaction, improve
our ability to anticipate future product needs, and enhance our understanding of key market
dynamics. We are confident that diligence in following this path will position Skyworks to
participate in numerous opportunities for growth in the future.

REVENUES FROM AND DEPENDENCE ON CUSTOMERS; CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION

For information regarding customer concentration and revenues from external customers for each of
the last three fiscal years, see Note 17 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

We own or are licensed under numerous United States and foreign patents and patent applications
related to our products, our manufacturing operations and processes, and other activities. In
addition, we own a number of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and
services. We believe that intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trade
secrets and trademarks are of material importance to our business. We rely on patent, copyright,
trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and
confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary
technologies, devices, algorithms and processes. We cannot guarantee that these efforts will
meaningfully protect our intellectual property, and others may independently develop substantially
equivalent proprietary technologies, devices, algorithms or processes. In addition, the laws of
some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the
United States, and effective copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret protection may not be
available in those jurisdictions. In addition to protecting our proprietary technologies and
processes, we strive to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to
obtain cross-licenses of intellectual property from others, to obtain access to intellectual
property we do not possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims
against us. Furthermore, in our linear products business, we seek to generate high gross margin revenue
through the sale and license of non-core intellectual property, and we on occasion purchase
intellectual property to support our core business. Due to rapid technological changes in the
industry, we believe that establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position depends
primarily on our ability to develop new innovative products through the technical competence of our
engineering personnel.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

We compete on the basis of time-to-market, new product innovation, overall product quality and
performance, price, compliance with industry standards, strategic relationships with customers, and
protection of our intellectual property. Certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than
we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to
devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.

Current and potential competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic
relationships among themselves or with our customers, resellers, suppliers or other third parties.
These relationships may affect our customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible
that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant
market share. We might not be able to compete successfully against
current and potential competitors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our products and markets are subject to continued technological advances. Recognizing the
importance of such technological advances, we maintain a high level of research and development
activities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help
identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands. Our design
centers are located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent
worldwide. We are focusing our development efforts on new products, design tools and manufacturing
processes using our core technologies. Our research and development expenditures for fiscal years
ended October 3, 2008, September 28, 2007, and September 29, 2006 were $146.0 million, $126.1
million, and $164.1 million, respectively.

RAW MATERIALS

Raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several
sources. We do not carry significant inventories and it is our policy not to depend on a sole
source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise. Consequently, there are
limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or
limited sources. We purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase
orders. However, we have a limited number of long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Certain
of our suppliers consign raw materials to us at our manufacturing facilities. We request these raw
materials and take title to them as they are needed in our manufacturing process. We believe we
have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs
with suppliers located around the world.



BACKLOG

Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products, with
such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions. Due
to industry practice, which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us
prior to shipment, and with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date
is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels. We also maintain Skyworks-owned finished
goods inventory at certain customer “hub” locations. We do not recognize revenue until these
customers consume the Skyworks-owned inventory from these hub locations.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment,
the disposal of hazardous wastes, and other activities affecting the environment have had, and will
continue to have, an impact on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with
environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without
material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial
condition.

Most of our European customers have mandated that our products comply with local and regional lead
free and other “green” initiatives. We believe that our current expenditures for environmental
capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing
environmental protection, and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims, will
not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or
financial condition. We cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

SEASONALITY

Sales of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in
end-user consumer applications, such as mobile handsets. The highest demand for our mobile handset
products generally occurs in the last calendar quarter ending in December. The lowest demand for
our mobile handset products generally occurs in the first calendar quarter ending in March.

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For information regarding net revenues by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal
years, see Note 17 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Risks attendant to our foreign operations are discussed in Item
1A-Risk Factors.

EMPLOYEES

As of October 3, 2008, we employed approximately 3,300 persons. Approximately 500 of our employees
in Mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

You should carefully consider the risks
described below in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an
investment decision.  Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed
by any of these risks.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we
face.  Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to
present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations,
financial condition or results from operations.

We operate in the highly cyclical wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is subject
to significant downturns.

We operate primarily in the wireless
semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user
products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Recently, deteriorating economic conditions
worldwide, together with other factors such as the unprecedented volatility of the financial
markets and liquidity concerns, make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately
forecast and plan future business activities. If such uncertainty and economic weakness
continues, the market for wireless semiconductor products is likely to contract and, as
a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations for our current
fiscal year would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry
downturn are characterized by diminished product demand, manufacturing overcapacity,
excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Furthermore,
downturns in the wireless semiconductor industry may be prolonged and any extended delay
or failure of the wireless semiconductor market to recover from an economic downturn would
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations
beyond our current fiscal year.



We have incurred substantial operating losses in the past and may experience future losses.

In the past, weak global economic conditions have led to a slowdown in customer orders, an increase
in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog, and higher overhead costs as a
percentage of our reduced net revenue. These factors contributed to operating losses for our
business in the past. Additionally, we have incurred operating losses in connection with the
restructuring of our business; for example, we had operating losses of $66.3 million during fiscal
year 2006 in connection with the exit of our baseband product area. While we had positive
operating results during fiscal years 2007 and 2008, we may experience future losses as a result of
a significant downturn in the economy, as a result of corporate restructuring activities, as a
result of market factors beyond our control or as a result of a combination of the foregoing.

Our operating results may be adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations
and market downturns.

Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our revenues,
earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are due to a
number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.

These factors include, among others:

The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could
materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating results
fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect
the price of our common stock.

Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.

The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such
fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:



Public stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This
volatility has significantly and negatively affected the market
prices of securities of many technology companies, including the
market price of our common stock.
These broad market fluctuations may further materially and adversely affect the market price of our common
stock in future periods.

In addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading
multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift
funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. Our
Company has been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such
commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meet
the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly
substantially over a short period of time.

The wireless semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition which may cause
pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and may materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we compete
in particular are very competitive. We compete with U.S. and international semiconductor
manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including RF Micro Devices,
Anadigics and TriQuint Semiconductor. As we continue to expand in the linear products markets, we
will compete with companies in other industries, including Analog Devices, Hittite Microwave,
Linear Technology and Maxim Integrated Products.

We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product
competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result
in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or
increasing market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of
growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign
and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes. We believe that the principal
competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:



•

strategic relationships with customers,

•

access to and protection of intellectual property, and

•

maintaining access to raw materials, supplies and services at a competitive cost.

We might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors enjoy the
benefit of:

•

long presence in key markets,

•

brand recognition,

•

high levels of customer satisfaction,

•

ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and

•

strong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or
other resources.

As a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging
technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the
development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.

Current and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or
strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third parties. These
relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new
competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market
share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and
potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross
margins and loss of market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.

The wireless communications semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, the markets into
which we sell our products are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid
technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards,
short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased
miniaturization, reduced power consumption and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our
operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and
enhanced products on a timely basis. The successful development and commercialization of
semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including:



Our ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends, among other
factors, on the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems, or IT
Systems.

We will be required to continually evaluate expenditures for planned product
development and to choose among alternative technologies based on our expectations of future market
growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless
communications semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that our products will
satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate
new industry standards and technological changes. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to
respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in
the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products
interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in
sufficient quantities that meet our customers requirements, our business and results of
operations would be materially and adversely harmed.

In addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. We cannot
assure you that our products will not become obsolete earlier than planned or have life cycles long
enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly,
we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and
delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced
products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products
to remain competitive.

If OEMs and Original Design Manufacturers, or ODMs, of communications electronics products do not
design our products into their equipment, we will have difficulty selling those products. Moreover,
a “design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer.

Our products are not sold directly to the end-user, but are components or subsystems of other
products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to
select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without
these “design wins,” we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs
another supplier’s product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to
achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost,
time, effort and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a
customer does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer. Even after a
design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to
reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially
successful, or for any other reason. We cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design
wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and any failure to do so could materially and
adversely affect our operating results.

Our manufacturing processes are extremely complex and specialized and disruptions could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including for causes beyond our
control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process
consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean
environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment, errors in any step of
the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in
equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial
percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to malfunction. Because our
operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at
acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material adverse affect on our
business. In addition, although we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, we
may discover from time to time defects in our products after they
have been shipped, and we may be required
to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification
provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. The potential liabilities associated with
these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are capped at significant
amounts, or are uncapped. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other
product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others,
including liability for costs associated with product recalls, or other



obligations under customer
contracts, which may adversely impact our operating results. If any of our products contain
defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged,
which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective
customers and could adversely affect our operating results.

Additionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at
any of our production facilities or those of our subcontractors. These disruptions may result from
electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or
risks, or other natural or manmade disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs and/or
upgrades such as the conversion to a 6” wafer manufacturing line currently in process at our
Newbury Park, California facility. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause
significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected facility
or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor. In the event of such delays, we cannot
assure you that the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, would be
available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative wafer production or assembly and test
capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in
higher costs and/or a loss of customers. We may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing
capacity to meet demand, either at our own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar
arrangements with others.

Due to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing
process, in the event of a disruption at the Newbury Park, California or Woburn, Massachusetts
semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities for any reason, alternative gallium arsenide production
capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our
gross margin and profitability.

Minor deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing
yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended. Manufacturing yields for new
products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume
manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward
product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result,
material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on
our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields
and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be
magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our
manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of product life
cycles, which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while
maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the
longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining
costs.

We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly and test of our products.

We rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide silicon-based
products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant
risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:

•

the lack of  wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices,

•

limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs and quality
assurance, and

•

the inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies.

Although we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing
capacity, the third-party foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the production
requirements of other customers. If we choose to use a new foundry, it will typically take an
extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products
from the new foundry. The foundries may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver
products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly



since some of them are located in earthquake zones. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity
occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore
experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could
impair our ability to meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating
results.

Although we own and operate a test and assembly facility, we still depend on subcontractors to
package, assemble and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. We do not have long-term agreements with any of
our assembly or test subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per
order basis. If any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial
difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other
disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and
testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify
assemblers and testers, we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are
required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components. Any problems that we may
encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our customer
relationships and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We are continuing to
develop relationships with additional third-party subcontractors to assemble and test our products.
However, even if we use these new subcontractors, we will continue to be subject to all of the
risks described above.

We are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.

Our manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the
components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain
relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have
adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs,
increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components can
result in tighter supplies. We cannot assure you that our suppliers will be able to meet our
delivery schedules, that we will not lose a significant or sole supplier, that a supplier will be
able to meet performance and quality specifications or that we will be able to purchase such
supplies or material at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery
schedules, or if we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality
specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely
affected. In addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components
for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may
modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into other sole
supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not
typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a
sole-source supplier for epitaxial wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing
processes at our manufacturing facilities. If we were to lose this sole source of supply, for any
reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is
obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw
materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.

Our reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material
adverse effect on the results of our operations.

Significant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we
lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly
decreased its orders for our products, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
Sales to our three largest OEM customers in fiscal 2008, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communication AB
(SEMC), Samsung, and Asian Information Technology, Inc. (AIT), including sales to their
manufacturing subcontractors (in the case of SEMC and Samsung), represented approximately 40% of
our net revenues for fiscal 2008.

If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to contribute to the design,
development, manufacture and sale of our products, we may not be able to effectively operate our
business.

As the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel represent a
significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate
qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel.
The competition for management and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry,
and therefore we cannot assure



you that
we will be able to attract and retain qualified management
and other personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We
may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor
operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock given, among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us and
our competitors. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to
attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to operate our business.

Lengthy product development and sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in
significant expenditures before generating any revenues related to those products.

After our product has been developed, tested and manufactured, our customers may need three to six
months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our product and an additional three to six months
or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates the product. This lengthy cycle
time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which
could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we
may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative
expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never
generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer
cancels or changes its product plans.

Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products could adversely
affect our business.

Our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term supply
arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before shipment. Additionally, we
sell a portion of our products through distributors, some of whom have rights to return unsold
products if the product is defective. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates
of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict. This difficulty may be
compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both,
as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In
addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The
cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or
overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or
obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition.

In addition, if a customer encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in
demand or for any other reason, the customer’s ability to make timely payments to us for
non-returnable products could be impaired.

We may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands
that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us
from using our technology.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual
property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert
patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are
important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their
technology or refrain from using it.

Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may infringe
intellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our contractual
indemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and
divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the
merits of any specific claim, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in litigation because of
the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If
litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:

•

pay substantial damages,

•

cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,

•

discontinue the use of infringing technology,



•

expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, and

•

license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms.

We cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be materially
adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to do any one or more of the
foregoing items.

In addition, if another supplier to one of
our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found
to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer
could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of its infringing
product(s) or process (es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from
our customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it
could have an adverse impact on our operating results.

Many of our products incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties. If licenses to
such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business
could be adversely affected.

We sell products in markets that are characterized
by rapid technological changes, evolving
industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and increasing
levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain
technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain
competitive. If licenses to such technology are not available on commercially reasonable terms and
conditions, and we cannot otherwise integrate such technology, our products or our customers’
products could become unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances,
we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute
technology to deliver competitive products.

If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, it may harm our ability to
compete.

We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well
as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary
technologies, information, data, devices, algorithms and processes. In addition, we often
incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers or other third parties into our
designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party
intellectual property. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like
activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to
determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This
could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our
management and technical personnel from our business operations. We cannot assure you that:

•

the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other
violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers,
suppliers or other third parties will be successful,

•

any existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other
intellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged, invalidated or
circumvented, or

•

any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection.

Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use
our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently or design around our
patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology,
it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, potentially resulting in
loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be
broad enough to adequately protect our technology. Furthermore, even if we receive patent
protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in
foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection
may be unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.



We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information through
operational, technological and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including former or
current employees, may attempt to copy, disclose or obtain access to our information without our
authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems
or information could result in our proprietary information being compromised or interrupt our
operations. While we attempt to prevent such unauthorized access we may be unable to anticipate the
methods used, or be unable to prevent the release of our proprietary information.

We are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.

A substantial majority of our net revenues are derived from customers located outside the United
States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have
suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging, assembly and test
facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we have our own packaging,
assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subject
to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating abroad. These include, but are not limited
to, risks regarding:

•

the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade,
foreign investment and loans, and import or export licensing requirements,

•

tax laws,

•

the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction, and

•

limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our
intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.

Additionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide
subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in handset prices that negatively impact
handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact
the demand for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in South Korea,
Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.



We face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.

To the extent that our existing cash and cash
equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient
to fund our future activities or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise additional
funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions
exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient
capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances
would have a material adverse effect on us.

In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our
business may require additional capital resources. We cannot assure you that the capital required
to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future.

Our leverage and our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.

On October 3, 2008, we had total indebtedness of
approximately $187.6 million, which represented
approximately 17.3% of our total capitalization. After the close of fiscal year 2008, we retired $40.5 million in
aggregate principal amount of our 1.25% and 1.50% convertible notes. Although our cash and
cash equivalents balance currently exceeds our total indebtedness, we have long term debt obligations that
mature in 2010 and 2012, and we may require additional financing prior to such dates in order to
allow us to sufficiently fund our research and development, capital expenditures, acquisitions, working
capital and other cash requirements, particularly if our
short-term revolving credit facility were not renewed.

Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences, including:

Despite our current debt levels, we believe we are able to incur
substantially more debt, which would increase
the risks described above.

Accounting
Rule Changes for Certain Convertible Debt Instruments Will Alter Trends Established in
Previous Periods

In May, 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)
No. APB 14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May be Settled in Cash upon
Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)

. This FSP alters the accounting treatment for
convertible debt instruments that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlements.
Specifically, it will significantly increase the non-cash interest expense associated with our
existing 1.25% and 1.50% convertible notes, and previously held 4.75% convertible notes including interest expense in
prior periods. The exact impact of this proposal to the Company’s financial statements is currently
being evaluated. The Company is not required to adopt FSP APB 14-1 until the first quarter of
fiscal 2010.



Remaining competitive in the semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry
process technologies and achieving higher levels of design integration.

In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to
increasingly smaller geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes
for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and to redesign some existing
products. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process
technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields,
delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar
difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry
processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our foundries to
transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that our foundries will
be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry
relationships. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to
efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we
expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third
party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher
levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.

Increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations may require us to redesign our
existing products and processes, and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce
our products.

The electronics industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number of
domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of
which have been used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of
Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive now requires that
certain substances be removed from all electronics components. Removing such substances requires
the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances, as
well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance
with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product
offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be
available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be
significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to
be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or
restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.

We may be liable for penalties under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which could
adversely impact our business.

We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in manufacturing
operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of environmental
protection regulations in the United States and in foreign countries. We cannot assure you that
current or future regulation of the materials necessary for our products would not have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental
regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations
regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of
environmental matters, including potential liabilities. Furthermore, our customers increasingly
require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. We cannot
assure you that the amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy
environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable
environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Our gallium arsenide semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.

Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor devices and
components, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of gallium arsenide
integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon circuits. The cost differential
is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium arsenide and higher unit costs associated with
smaller sized wafers and lower production volumes. Therefore, to remain



competitive, we must offer
gallium arsenide products that provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts.
If we do not continue to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify
the cost differential, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We expect
the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of producing
their silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely used process technologies
for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to improve in performance. We
cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products and markets that require performance
attributes of gallium arsenide solutions.

To be successful we may need to effect investments, alliances and acquisitions, and to integrate
companies we acquire.

Although we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in
internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes
and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to
pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review
investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment
our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. However, we cannot assure you that
we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance or acquisition
transactions in the future. Moreover, if we consummate such transactions, they could result in:

Moreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult,
expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with employees and
customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition,
we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment.
When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with
a charge against earnings.

Certain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for
someone to acquire control of us.

We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of
incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that
would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction not approved by our
Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:

•

the division of our Board of Directors into three classes to be elected on a
staggered basis, one class each year,

•

the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one
or more series without further authorization of stockholders,

•

a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,

•

elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders,



In addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation shall not engage in any
business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the
time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors
then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the
stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are
met.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

From time to time, various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been, and may in the future be,
instituted or asserted against the Company, including those pertaining to patent infringement,
intellectual property, environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment and
contractual matters.

Additionally, the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of
intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future
assert patent, copyright, trademark and



other intellectual property rights to technologies that are
important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their
technology. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims
or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company. Intellectual property disputes often
have a risk of injunctive relief, which, if imposed against the Company, could materially and
adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, or results of operations.

From time to time we are a party in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We
believe that there is no such ordinary course litigation pending that will have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business.

In fiscal 2008, we recorded restructuring and other special charges of $0.6 million related
to lease obligations associated with the closure of certain locations associated with the
baseband product area.

In fiscal 2007, we recorded restructuring and other special charges of $4.9 million related to
the exit of the baseband product area. These charges consist of $4.5 million relating to the
exit of certain operating leases, $0.5 million relating to additional severance, $1.4 million
related to the write-off of technology licenses and design software, offset by a $1.5 million
credit related to the reversal of a reserve originally recorded to account for an engineering
vendor charge associated with the exit of the baseband product area. We also recorded an
additional approximate $0.8 million charge in restructuring reserves. This charge consists of
a single lease obligation that expires in 2008.

In fiscal 2006, we recorded restructuring and other special charges of $27.0 million related
to the exit of our baseband product area. Of the $27.0 million, $13.1 million related to

design software associated with the baseband product area, $4.2 million related to the
impairment of baseband related long-lived assets and $2.3 million related to other charges.

In fiscal 2004, we recorded restructuring and special charges of $17.4 million, principally
related to the impairment of legacy technology licenses related to our baseband product area.

(5)

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded approximately $5.8 million of premium in
excess of par value and $1.0 million of deferred financing costs relating to the early
retirement of $62.4 million of 1.25% and 1.50% convertible subordinated notes.

(6)

Fiscal years ended October 3, 2008, September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 included $23.2
million, $13.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense
due to the adoption of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised
2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(R)”). Fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 includes
share-based compensation expense of approximately $3.0 million, $8.7 million and $11.5
million in cost of goods sold, research and development expense, and selling, general and
administrative expense, respectively. Fiscal year ended September 28, 2007 includes
share-based compensation expense of approximately $1.3 million, $5.6 million and $6.8 million
in cost of goods sold, research and development expense, and selling, general and
administrative expense, respectively, and fiscal year ended September 29, 2006 includes
share-based compensation expense of approximately $2.2 million, $6.3 million and $5.7 million

income, $40.0 million and $14.2 million of the Company’s
valuation allowance was reversed at October 3, 2008 and
September 28, 2007, respectively. For fiscal 2008, the amount
reversed consisted of $36.4 million recognized as income tax benefit, and
$3.6 million recognized as a reduction
to goodwill. For fiscal 2007, the amount reversed consisted of $1.7
million recognized as income tax benefit, and $12.5 million
recognized as a reduction to goodwill.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear
elsewhere in this Annual Report on

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2008 consisted of 53
weeks and ended on October 3, 2008. The extra week occurred in the fourth quarter and the Company
does not believe it had a material impact on its results from
operations. Fiscal years 2007 and 2006 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on
September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively.

We market and sell our mobile platforms and linear products to top tier Original Equipment
Manufacturers (“OEMs”) of communication electronic products, third-party Original Design
Manufacturers (“ODMs”) and contract manufacturers, and indirectly through electronic components
distributors. We periodically enter into strategic arrangements leveraging our broad intellectual
property portfolio by licensing or selling our patents or other intellectual property. We
anticipate continuing this intellectual property strategy in future periods.

Overall revenues in fiscal 2008 increased by $118.3 million, or 15.9%, from fiscal 2007. This
revenue growth was principally due to the ramp of new mobile platform products, the addition of new
mobile platform customers, diversification into new, adjacent markets and the expansion of our
market share in increasingly complex front-end modules at our existing customers. Net revenues from
our top three customers decreased to 43.5% for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 as compared to
48.5% for the corresponding period in the prior year, reflecting continued



expansion of our customer base. Average selling prices declined 6.6% year over year compared to a
decline of 8.1% in the prior year.

Overall revenues in fiscal 2007 declined by $32.0 million, or 4.1%, from fiscal 2006 due to the
exit of our baseband product area at the end of fiscal year 2006. Revenues from our mobile
platforms and linear product areas remained relatively unchanged over that same period. We
experienced a more favorable product mix in fiscal 2007 which was offset by a decline in average
selling prices of 8.1%.

For information regarding net revenues by geographic region and customer concentration for each of
the last three fiscal years, see Note 17 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold consists primarily
of purchased materials, labor and overhead (including depreciation and equity based compensation
expense) associated with product manufacturing.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues improved to 39.9% in fiscal year 2008, from 38.7% in
fiscal year 2007, and was principally the result of a more favorable revenue mix. Additionally,
gross profit margin improved as a result of higher equipment efficiencies at all of our factories
as our established hybrid manufacturing model with multiple external foundries allows us to
maintain high internal capacity utilization by using second-sources for high fixed cost services
like foundry and assembly. This approach provides supply chain flexibility, lower capital
investment, the ability to meet upside demand and provides cost advantages. Furthermore, yield
improvements and year-over-year material cost reductions along with the increased overall revenue
contributed to the gross profit and margin improvement in both aggregate dollars and as a
percentage of sales. In fiscal year 2008, we continued to benefit from higher contribution margins
associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues improved to 38.7% in fiscal year 2007, from 33.9% in
fiscal year 2006, as higher gross profit margin mobile platforms and linear products became a
greater percentage of our overall net revenues since we exited the lower margin baseband product
area at the end of fiscal 2006. Additionally, inventory related charges recorded in fiscal 2006
related to the exit of our baseband product area did not recur in fiscal 2007. Furthermore, we
improved absorption as our factory utilization increased and we experienced improved overall yields
and greater equipment efficiency. Finally, we benefited from higher contribution margins received
from the licensing and sale of intellectual property in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year
2006.

Research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs, costs for
pre-production evaluation and testing of new devices, and design and test tool costs.

The increase in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars for fiscal year 2008 when compared to fiscal year 2007 is principally attributable to increased labor and benefit
costs and increases in elot and mask expenditures and variable materials and supplies expenses as
we continued to invest in new product developments in both our mobile platforms and linear product
areas.



The decrease in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net
revenues in fiscal year 2007 when compared to fiscal year 2006 is predominantly attributable to
decreased labor and benefit costs as a result of the workforce reductions associated with the exit
of our baseband product area at the end of fiscal 2006. In addition, efficiencies were achieved in
the utilization of outside services, fixed materials and supplies, rent costs, relocation costs,
business travel and hardware/software costs. The reductions in the labor intensive research and
development costs associated with the exit of our baseband product area enabled us to refocus,
enhance and target our research and development spending on our higher growth core product areas in
fiscal year 2007.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include legal, accounting, treasury, human resources,
information systems, customer service, bad debt expense, sales representative commissions,
advertising, marketing and other costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in aggregate dollars for fiscal year 2008 as
compared to fiscal year 2007, primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense, higher
incentive compensation costs and higher sales commissions. Selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased for fiscal 2008,
as compared to fiscal 2007, as a result of the overall increase in
net revenues along with selling, general and administrative costs
increasing at a lower rate than the revenue growth rate.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of
revenues for fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 primarily due to our recording of
$35.1 million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as we exited our baseband
product area. In addition, we incurred lower sales commissions and professional fees in fiscal
2007.

The increase in amortization expense during the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 as compared to
fiscal 2007 is due to the acquisitions completed in October 2007 and the associated amortizable
customer relationships, patents, order backlog, foundry services agreement and developed technology
that were acquired. In fiscal 2008, the gross of our amortizable intangible assets increased by
approximately $13.2 million.

In 2002, we recorded $36.4 million of intangible assets consisting of developed technology,
customer relationships and a trademark acquired by the Company. These assets are principally being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10-year period. Amortization expense in fiscal 2007 and
2006 primarily represents the amortization of these intangible assets.

Restructuring and special charges consist of charges for asset impairments and restructuring
activities, as follows:

On September 29, 2006, the Company exited its baseband product area in order to focus on its mobile
platforms and linear product areas. The Company recorded various charges associated with this
action.

During the fiscal year ended September 29, 2006, we recorded $13.1 million related to severance and
benefits, $7.4 million related to the write-down of technology licenses and design software, $4.2
million related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets and $2.3 million related to other
charges.

During the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007, we recorded additional restructuring charges of
$4.9 million related to the exit of the baseband product area. These charges consist of $4.5
million relating to the exit of certain operating leases, $0.5 million relating to additional
severance, $1.4 million related to the write-off of technology licenses and design software, offset
by a $1.5 million credit related to the reversal of a reserve originally recorded to account for an
engineering vendor charge associated with the exit of the baseband product area. In addition, the
Company recorded an additional $0.8 million charge for a single lease obligation that expires in
2008 relating to our 2002 restructuring.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, additional restructuring charges of $0.6 million were
recorded relating to lease obligations due to the closure of certain locations that formerly
supported the baseband product area.

For additional information regarding restructuring charges and liability balances, see Note 15 of

Interest expense is comprised principally of payments in connection with the $50.0 million credit
facility between Skyworks USA, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, and Wachovia Bank, N.A.
(“Facility Agreement”), the Company’s 4.75% convertible subordinated notes (the “Junior Notes”),
and the Company’s 1.25% and 1.50% convertible subordinated notes (the “2007 Convertible Notes”).

The decrease in interest expense for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 as compared to fiscal
2007 in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is due to the retirement of the
remaining $49.3 million of higher interest rate Junior Notes during the first quarter of fiscal
2008 and the early retirement of $62.4 million of the Company’s 2007 Convertible Notes in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

The decrease in interest expense both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for
fiscal 2007, when compared to fiscal 2006, is primarily due to the retirement of $130.0 million of
our higher interest rate Junior Notes coupled with the issuance of the
substantially lower interest rate 2007 Convertible Notes in March 2007.

The decreases in other income in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for the

interest income on invested cash balances due to lower interest rates in fiscal 2008.

The increase in other income, net between fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 is primarily due to an
increase in interest income on invested cash balances as a result of increased interest rates and
higher invested cash balances.

Income tax (benefit) for fiscal 2008 was $(28.8) million as compared to $(0.9) million benefit for
fiscal 2007. Income tax (benefit) expense for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 consists of approximately
$(28.2) million and $(2.2) million, respectively, of United States income tax benefit. The fiscal
2008 benefit of $(28.2) million is due to a $(36.4) million reduction in the valuation allowance
related to the partial recognition of future tax benefits on United States federal and state net
operating loss and credit carryforwards, U.S. income tax expense of
$1.2 million, and a  charge in lieu of tax expense of $7.0
million. The charge in lieu of tax expense resulted from a partial
recognition of certain acquired tax benefits that were subject to a valuation allowance at the time
of acquisition, the realization of which required a reduction of goodwill. The fiscal 2007 United
States income tax (benefit) of $(2.2) million is due to a $(1.7) million reduction in the valuation
allowance related to the partial recognition of future tax benefits on United States federal and
state net operating carryforwards and the reversal of $(0.5) million of tax reserve no longer
required. The income tax provision for fiscal 2006 was comprised of a favorable adjustment of
$(0.1) million between fiscal 2005’s tax provision and tax return liability, and foreign tax
expense of $15.5 million.



The provision (benefit) for foreign income taxes for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $(0.6)
million, $1.3 million, and $15.5 million, respectively. The foreign tax benefit for fiscal 2008
included a reversal of $(1.0) million of reserves for tax uncertainties that are no longer
required. Foreign tax expense for fiscal 2006 included a one time charge of $14.6 million to write
off a deferred tax asset as a result of reorganizing our Mexico business.

In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 109,

Accounting for
Income Taxes

(“SFAS 109”) management has determined that it is
more likely than not that a portion of our historic and current year income tax benefits will not
be realized. Accordingly, as of October 3, 2008, we have established a valuation allowance of $82.9
million of which $81.6 million relates to our United States deferred tax assets and $1.3 million
relates to our foreign operations.

Realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon
generating taxable income in the future.
The Company considered several factors in evaluating the Company’s capacity to generate future
earnings. Skyworks has produced a strong earnings trend generating cumulative earnings of $66.2
million in fiscal years 2006 through 2008. In addition, 2008 revenue increased 15.9% over 2007 and
gross profit as a percentage of sales has improved in the last three years. Based on the
aforementioned positive factors, Skyworks projected future earnings to determine the realizability
of our income tax benefit. Our projections considered the business uncertainty resulting from the
current economic crisis, market forecasts and the cyclical nature of our business. Based on the
Company’s evaluation of the realizability of its net deferred tax assets through the
generation of future income, $40.0 million of the Company’s valuation allowance was reversed at
October 3, 2008. The amount reversed consisted of $36.4 million recognized as income tax benefit,
and $3.6 million recognized as a reduction to goodwill. The remaining valuation allowance as of
October 3, 2008 is $82.9 million. When recognized, the tax benefits relating to any future
reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as follows:
approximately $71.4 million will be recognized as an income tax benefit, $7.6 million will be
recognized as a reduction to goodwill and $3.9 million will be recognized as an increase to
shareholders’ equity for certain tax deductions from employee stock options.

The Company will continue to evaluate its valuation allowance in future periods and depending upon
the outcome of that assessment, additional amounts could be reversed or recorded and recognized as
a reduction to goodwill or an adjustment to income tax benefit or expense. Such adjustments could
cause our effective income tax rate to vary in future periods. We will need to generate $327.2
million of future United States federal taxable income to utilize all of our net operating loss
carryforwards, research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards, and deferred income tax temporary differences as of
October 3, 2008.

No provision has been made for United States, state, or additional foreign income taxes related to
approximately $8.9 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are
intended to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the United States
federal income tax liability, if any, which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently
reinvested.

On September 29,
2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. This statement also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in the interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The provisions of FIN
48 will be applied to all income tax provisions commencing from that date.

During the year ended October 3, 2008, the statute of limitations period expired relating to an
unrecognized tax benefit. The expiration of the statute of limitations period resulted in the
recognition of $1.0 million of previously unrecognized tax benefit, including accrued interest on
our tax position which impacted the effective tax rate as a discrete item. Including this
reversal, total year-to-date accrued interest related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits
was a benefit of $0.4 million.

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at October 3, 2008, $0.6 million would impact the
effective tax rate, if recognized. There are no positions which we anticipate could change within
the next twelve months.



On October 1, 2007, Mexico enacted a new “flat tax” regime which became effective January 1, 2008.
SFAS 109 prescribes that the effect of the new tax on deferred taxes must be included in tax
expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The effect of recording deferred taxes in
the first fiscal quarter of 2008 to the foreign tax provision (benefit) was $(0.2) million. In
addition to the deferred taxes, the Company has accrued flat tax for the year ended October 3, 2008
of $0.3 million.

FISCAL 2008

Based on our results of operations for fiscal 2008, along with current
trends, we expect our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated
from operations, will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures,
debt obligations, working capital and other cash requirements for at least
the next 12 months. However, we cannot be certain that the capital required to fund these expenses
will be available in the future. In addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we
may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources. If we are unable to
obtain sufficient capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis
and on favorable terms (if at all), our business and
operations could be materially adversely affected.

Cash and cash equivalent balances decreased $16.5 million to $225.1 million at October 3, 2008 from
$241.6 million at September 28, 2007. We generated $173.7 million in cash from operations during
the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, which was offset by the retirement of $49.3 million of
Junior Notes, $62.4 million of the 2007 Convertible Notes, capital expenditures of $64.8 million
and expenditures on acquisitions of $32.6 million. The number of days sales outstanding for the
fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 decreased to 57 from 80 for fiscal 2007.

During fiscal 2008, we generated net income of $111.0 million. We experienced a decrease in
receivables and other assets of $21.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively, an increase in
accounts payable balances of $2.1 million and incurred multiple non-cash charges (e.g.,
depreciation, amortization, charge in lieu of income tax expense,  contribution of common shares to
savings and retirement plans, share-based compensation expense and non-cash restructuring expense)
totaling $94.9 million. This was offset by an increase in inventories of $16.1 million, a decrease
in other accrued liabilities of $5.1 million and an increase to
our deferred tax assets of $36.6
million (primarily the result of a partial release of our tax valuation allowance in fiscal 2008).

Cash used
in investing activities for the fiscal year ended October 3,
2008, consisted of net sales
of $2.5 million in auction rate securities and investments in capital equipment of $64.8 million
primarily to expand fabrication and assembly and test capacity. We believe a focused program of
capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities. We expect
that future capital expenditures will be funded by the generation of positive cash flows from
operations. In addition, we paid $32.6 million in cash to acquire certain assets from two separate
companies. We acquired Freescale Semiconductor’s handset power amplifier business and also acquired
patents from another company. We may also consider additional future acquisition opportunities to
extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings.

Cash used in financing
activities for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, consisted of the
retirement of the remaining $49.3 million in Junior Notes, the retirement of $62.4 million of our
2007 Convertible Notes, and the repurchase of treasury stock of $2.1 million, offset by cash
provided by stock option exercises of $18.0 million. For additional information regarding our
borrowing arrangements, see Note 8 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In connection with our exit of the baseband product area, we anticipate making remaining cash
payments of approximately $2.4 million in future periods. Certain payments on severance and
long-term lease obligations resulting from facility closures will be remitted primarily in fiscal
2009.



Our invested cash balances primarily consist of United States treasury obligations, United States
agency obligations, overnight repurchase agreements backed by United States treasuries or United
States agency obligations, highly rated commercial paper and certificates of deposit. At October 3, 2008, we also held a $3.2
million auction rate security which historically has provided liquidity through a Dutch auction
process. The recent disruptions in the credit markets have substantially eliminated the liquidity
of this process resulting in failed auctions. During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, we
performed a comprehensive valuation and discounted cash flow analysis on the auction rate security.
We concluded the value of the auction rate security was
$2.3 million, and the carrying value of
these securities was reduced by $0.9 million, reflecting this change in fair value. Accordingly,
in the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, we recorded unrealized losses on this auction rate
security of approximately $0.9 million. We assessed these declines in fair market value to be
temporary and consider the security to be illiquid until there is a successful auction.
Accordingly, the remaining auction rate security balance has been reclassified to non-current other
assets and the loss has been recorded in Other Comprehensive Income. We will continue to monitor
the liquidity and accounting classification of this security in future periods. If in a future
period, we determine that the impairment is other than temporary, we will impair the security to
its fair value and charge the loss to earnings.

After the
close of fiscal 2008, we retired an additional $40.5 million of our 2007
Convertible Notes (due in 2012) at an average discounted price of $92.58 per $100.00 of par value. These
retirements reduced the remaining principal balance on our 2007
Convertible Notes to $97.1 million as of November 12, 2008.

On July 15, 2003, we entered into a receivables purchase agreement under which we have agreed to
sell from time to time certain of our accounts receivable to Skyworks USA, Inc. (“Skyworks USA”), a
wholly-owned special purpose entity that is fully consolidated for accounting purposes.
Concurrently, Skyworks USA entered into an agreement with Wachovia Bank, N.A. providing for a $50.0
million credit facility (“Facility Agreement’’) secured by the purchased accounts receivable. As a
part of the consolidation, any interest incurred by Skyworks USA related to monies it borrows under
the Facility Agreement is recorded as interest expense in the Company’s results of operations. We
perform collections and administrative functions on behalf of Skyworks USA. Interest related to the
Facility Agreement is at LIBOR plus 0.75%. We renewed the Facility
Agreement for another year in July 2008, and as of October 3, 2008, Skyworks USA had borrowed $50.0
million under this agreement.

FISCAL 2007

Our cash and cash equivalent balances increased by $104.8 million to $241.6 million at September
28, 2007 from $136.7 million at September 29, 2006. Cash and cash equivalent balances and
short-term investments increased by $82.6 million to $253.8 million at September 28, 2007 from
$171.2 million at September 29, 2006. The number of days sales outstanding for the fiscal year
ended September 28, 2007 increased to 80 from 73 as compared to fiscal 2006.

During fiscal 2007, we generated $84.8 million in cash from operating activities. Contributing to
these positive operating cash flows was net income of $57.7 million. We also incurred multiple
non-cash charges (e.g., depreciation, amortization, contribution of common shares to savings and
retirement plans, share-based compensation expense and non-cash restructuring expense) totaling
$66.6 million. In fiscal 2007, we also experienced a decrease in accounts payable balances of $16.7
million, a decrease in other accrued liability balances of $10.8 million and an increase in
receivable balances of $10.7 million. Furthermore, we experienced an increase in deferred tax assets
of $1.7 million primarily resulting from the partial release of our tax valuation allowance in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Finally, provision for losses on accounts receivable increased by
$2.2 million principally due to further reserves recorded for baseband product area customers.

During fiscal 2007, we utilized $20.1 million in cash from investing activities. Cash provided by
investing activities in fiscal 2007 consisted of net proceeds of $22.5 million from the sale of
auction rate securities. Capital expenditures of $42.6 million offset these net proceeds and were
primarily related to the purchase of equipment utilized in our fabrication facilities to support
and enhance our assembly and test capacity.



During fiscal 2007, we generated $40.2 million in cash from financing activities. This principally
resulted from the issuance of our 2007 Convertible Notes offering which generated gross proceeds of
$200.0 million, and stock option exercises of $8.3 million, offset by repayment of $130.0 million
on our Junior Notes, a common stock buyback of 4.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $31.7
million, and financing costs associated with our 2007 Convertible Notes offering of $6.2 million.
As of September 28, 2007 our Facility Agreement of
$50.0 million was fully drawn. We paid
approximately $12.4 million in interest to service the 2007 Convertible Notes, the Junior Notes and
the Facility Agreement in fiscal 2007. For additional information regarding our borrowing
arrangements, see Note 8 of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various
other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. To the extent actual results differ from those estimates, our
future results of operations may be affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title, in accordance with
the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer. Revenue from license fees and
intellectual property is recognized when these fees are due and payable, and all other criteria of
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,



Revenue
Recognition

, have been met. We ship product on consignment to certain customers and
only recognize revenue when the customer notifies us that the inventory has been consumed. Revenue
recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete. Certain product
sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection
and/or a right of return on unsold products. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for
customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event
necessitating a reserve.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be
required.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market.
The Company provides for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions
about future demand and market conditions. The recoverability of inventories is assessed through an
on-going review of inventory levels in relation to sales backlog and forecasts, product marketing
plans and product life cycles. When the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand (generally
in excess of twelve months), the value of such inventory that is not expected to be sold at the
time of the review is written down. The amount of the write-down is the excess of historical cost
over estimated realizable value (generally zero).

Once established, these write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the
excess inventory. If actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Some or all of the inventories that
have been written-down may be retained and made available for sale. In the event that actual demand
is higher than originally projected, a portion of these inventories may be able to be sold in the
future. Inventories that have been written-down and are identified as obsolete are generally
scrapped.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(R)”) which requires the measurement and recognition of
compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including
employee stock options, employee stock purchases related to the Company’s 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, restricted stock and other special equity awards based on estimated fair values. The
Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the
application of the applicable accounting standard as of October 1, 2005, the first day of the
Company’s fiscal year 2006.

Share-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion
of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Share-based
compensation expense recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the
fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 included compensation expense for share-based payment awards
granted on or before, but not yet vested as of, September 30, 2005, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123, and compensation expense
for the share-based payment awards granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 based on the grant date
fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). As share-based compensation
expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended October 3,
2008 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
SFAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company elected to retain its method of valuation for share-based
awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (“Black-Scholes model”) which was also
previously used for the Company’s pro forma information required under SFAS 123. The Company’s
determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes model is affected by the Company’s stock price



as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These
variables include, but are not limited to; the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the
term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. For more
complex awards with market-based performance conditions, the Company employs a Monte Carlo
simulation method which calculates many potential outcomes for an award and establishes fair value
based on the most likely outcome.

SFAS 123(R) requires the Company to evaluate and periodically validate several assumptions in
conjunction with calculating share-based compensation expense. These assumptions include the
expected life of a stock option or other equity based award, expected volatility, pre-vesting
forfeiture, risk free rate and expected dividend yield. All of these assumptions affect to one
degree or another, the valuation of the Company’s equity based awards or the recognition of the
resulting share-based compensation expense. The most significant assumptions in the Company’s
calculations are described below.

Expected Life of an Option or other Equity Based Award

Since employee options are non-transferable, SFAS 123(R) allows the use of an expected life to more
accurately estimate the value of an employee stock option rather than using the full contractual
term.

The vesting of the majority of the Company’s stock options are graded over four years (25% at each
anniversary) and the contractual term is either 7 years or 10 years. The Company analyzed its
historical exercise experience and exercise behavior by job group. The Company analyzed the
following three exercise metrics: exercise at full vesting, exercise at midpoint in the contractual
life and exercise at the end of the full contractual term. The Company chose the mid-point
alternative as the estimate which most closely approximated actual exercise experience of its
employee population. The valuation and resulting share-based compensation expense recorded is
sensitive to what alternative is chosen and the choice of another alternative in the future could
result in a material difference in the amount of share-based compensation expense recorded in a
reporting period.

Expected Volatility

Expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to
fluctuate during a period. SFAS 123(R) does not specify a method for estimating expected
volatility; instead it provides a list of factors that should be considered when estimating
volatility: historical volatility that is generally commensurate with the expected option life,
implied volatilities, the length of time a stock has been publicly traded, regular intervals for
price observations, corporate and capital structure and the possibility of mean reversion. The
Company analyzed its volatility history and determined that the selection of a weighting of 50% to
historical volatility and 50% to implied volatility (as measured by examining the underlying
volatility in the open market of publicly traded call options) would provide the best estimate of
expected future volatility of the stock price. The selection of another methodology to calculate
volatility or even a different weighting between implied volatility and historical volatility could
materially impact the valuation of stock options and other equity based awards and the resulting
amount of share-based compensation expense recorded in a reporting period.

Pre-Vesting Forfeiture

SFAS 123(R) specifies that initial accruals of share-based compensation expense should be based on
the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered.
The Company examined its options forfeiture history and computed an average annualized forfeiture
percentage. The Company determined that a weighted average of historical annualized forfeitures is
the best estimate of future actual forfeiture experience. The application of a different
methodology for calculating estimated forfeitures could materially impact the amount of share-based
compensation expense recorded in a reporting period.

VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Carrying values for long-lived assets and definite lived intangible assets, which excludes
goodwill, are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

Impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate



that the carrying amount of any
such asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The determination of recoverability is based on
an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual
disposition. The estimate of cash flows is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions
about expected future operating performance. The Company’s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may
differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, technological changes, economic
conditions, changes to the Company’s business model or changes in its operating performance. If the
sum of the undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value of an asset
or asset group, the Company recognizes an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined using
discounted cash flows.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

The
goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step of the
impairment analysis compares the Company’s fair value to its net book value to determine if there
is an indicator of impairment. In determining fair value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of
several valuation methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of
fair value. The Company calculates fair value using the average market price of its common stock
over a seven-day period surrounding the annual impairment testing date of the first day of the
fourth fiscal quarter and the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of the
annual impairment test (the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter). If the assessment in the first
step indicates impairment then the Company performs step two. Step two of the analysis compares the
implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner
similar to a purchase price allocation for a business combination. If the carrying amount of
goodwill  exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is
recognized equal to that excess. Intangible assets are tested for impairment using an estimate of discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset.  We test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment
annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events
occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets may be impaired.
Indicators such as unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated
technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel, and acts by governments and
courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.

INCOME TAXES

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. This method also requires the
recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that
realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

The carrying value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets assumes that the Company will be able
to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and
assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be
required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in
additional income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Management
evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation
allowance quarterly. Likewise, in the event that the Company was to determine that it would be able
to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an
adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of
goodwill in the period such determination was made.

The calculation of our tax liabilities
includes addressing uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. With the implementation effective September 29, 2007,
FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return.



We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax
jurisdictions based on our recognition threshold and measurement attribute of whether it is more
likely than not that the positions we have taken in tax filings will be sustained upon tax audit,
and the extent to which, additional taxes would be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately
proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being
recognized in the period in which it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the
estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to
expense would result.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

SFAS 157

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”) which defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets carried at fair value, and years beginning after November 15, 2008 for non-financial assets not carried at fair value.  The Company has
not yet determined the impact that SFAS 157 will have on its results from operations or financial
position.

SFAS 159

In February 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”) including an amendment of SFAS No. 115, which permits entities
to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not
currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company beginning in
fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS 159 will not have a material impact on the Company’s results from
operations or financial position.

SFAS 141(R)

In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS
141(R)”)

.

SFAS 141(R) applies to any transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business
combination. Where applicable, SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the
acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree and goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase. In addition, SFAS 141(R)
determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the
nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement is to be applied
prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008. The Company will evaluate the impact of
SFAS 141(R) on its Consolidated Financial Statements in the event future business combinations are
contemplated.

SFAS 160

In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 amends ARB 51 to establish accounting
and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation
of a subsidiary. It also amends certain of ARB 51’s consolidation procedures for consistency with
the requirements of SFAS 141(R). This statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The statement shall be applied
prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is initially adopted.
The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to impact its results of operations or
financial position because the Company does not have any minority interests.

SFAS 161

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161

, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

(“SFAS 161”)

.

SFAS 161 amends FASB Statement No.
133 to require enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities thereby
improving the transparency of financial reporting. Entities are required to provide enhanced
disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related
interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This Statement is effective for
financial statements issued



for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application
encouraged. The Company does not currently hold any positions in derivative instruments or
participate in hedging activities and thus does not expect the adoption of SFAS 161 to have any
impact on its results of operations or financial position.

FSP No. 142-3

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)
No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful
Life of Intangible Assets

(“FSP 142-3”).  FSP 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing
renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible
assets under FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

. This new guidance
applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other
assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP 142-3 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008.  Early
adoption is prohibited. The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP 142-3 to have any material impact on its results of operations or financial position.

FSP No. APB 14-1

In May 2008, the
FASB issued FSP No. APB 14-1,

Accounting for Convertible
Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion
(Including Partial Cash Settlement)

(“FSP APB 14-1”). FSP APB 14-1 alters the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either
mandatory or optional cash settlements.  FSP APB 14-1 is expected to impact the Company’s
accounting for its 2007 Convertible Notes and previously held Junior Notes. This FSP requires
registrants with specified convertible note features to recognize (non-cash) interest expense based
on the market rate for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature. Furthermore,
pursuant to its retrospective accounting treatment, the FSP requires prior period interest expense
recognition. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2008.  The Company is currently evaluating FSP APB 14-1 and
the impact that it will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is not required
to adopt FSP APB 14-1 until the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

FSP No. 133-1 and FIN 45-4

In September 2008, the FASB
issued FSP No. 133-1,

Disclosures about Credit
Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133

(“FSP 133-1”) and FASB
Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161. This FSP
amends FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

to
require disclosures by sellers of credit derivatives, including credit derivatives embedded in a
hybrid instrument. This FSP also amends FASB Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,

to
require an additional disclosure about the current status of the payment/performance risk of a
guarantee. Further, this FSP clarifies the Board’s intent about the effective date of FASB
Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. The provisions
of this FSP that amend Statement 133 and Interpretation 45 shall be effective for reporting periods
(annual or interim) ending after November 15, 2008. The Company does not currently hold any
positions in derivative instruments or participate in hedging activities and thus does not expect
the adoption of FSP 133-1 and FIN 45-4 to have any impact on its results of operations or
financial position.

FSP No. FAS 157-3

In October 2008, the FASB
issued FSP No. FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair
Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not
Active

(“FSP 157-3”) which clarifies the
application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key
considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset. SFAS 157 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets carried at fair value, and years beginning after November 15, 2008 for non-financial assets not carried at fair value.  The Company has
not yet determined the impact that SFAS 157 will have on its results from operations or financial
position.



OTHER MATTERS

Inflation did not have a material impact upon our results of operations during the three-year
period ended October 3, 2008.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are subject to foreign currency, market rate and interest risks as described below:

Investment and Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest and market risks relates principally to our investment portfolio, which as
of October 3, 2008 consisted of the following (in thousands):

Cash and cash equivalents (time deposits, overnight repurchase
agreements and money market funds)

$

225,104

Restricted cash (time deposits and certificates of deposit)

5,962

Available for sale securities (auction rate securities)

2,288

$

233,354

Our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital. Our policy is to invest with only high-credit-quality issuers and limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes.

Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments. We are however, subject to overall
financial market risks, such as changes in market liquidity, credit quality and interest rates.

Available for sale securities carry a longer maturity period (contractual maturities exceed ten
years). In fiscal 2008 we experienced a temporary unrealized loss on our investment in auction
rate securities primarily caused by a disruption in the liquidity of the Dutch auction process
which resets interest rates each month. We classified auction rate securities in prior periods as
current assets under “Short Term Investments”. In fiscal 2008, we determined the fair value of our
auction rate securities to be $2.3 million. Given the failed auctions, the auction rate securities
are effectively illiquid until there is a successful auction. Accordingly, the remaining auction
rate securities balance has been reclassified to non-current other assets. We believe we have the ability to hold these investments until the lack of liquidity in these markets is resolved or they
 mature. If current market conditions deteriorate further, we may be required to record additional unrealized losses. If the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate, the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, or we need funds from the auction-rate securities to meet working capital needs, we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through impairment charges recorded to
earnings as appropriate, which could be material.

Our short-term debt consists of borrowings under our credit facility with
Wachovia Bank, N.A. of $50.0 million. Interest related to our borrowings under our credit facility with Wachovia Bank, N.A. is at LIBOR plus 0.75% and was approximately
4.7% at October 3, 2008. Consequently, we do not have significant cash flow exposure on this short-term debt.

Our long-term debt at November 12, 2008 consists of $97.1 million  aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes (“2007 Convertible Notes”). These 2007 Convertible Notes contain cash settlement provisions, which permit the application of the treasury stock method in determining potential
share dilution of the conversion spread should the share price of the Company’s common stock exceed $9.52. It has been the Company’s historical practice to cash settle the principal and interest components of convertible debt instruments, and it is our intention to continue to do so in the future, including settlement of
the 2007 Convertible Notes issued in March 2007. These shares have
not been included in the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Exchange Rate Risk

Substantially all sales to customers and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for
pricing and payment in United States dollars, thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate
fluctuations on our results. A small percentage of our international operational expenses are
denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rate volatility could negatively or positively impact
those operating costs. For the fiscal years ended October 3, 2008, September 28, 2007, and
September 29, 2006, the Company incurred unrealized foreign exchange gains/(losses) of $(0.6)
million, $0.4 million, and $0.1 million, respectively. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact
our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other
currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Skyworks Solutions, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. as of
October 3, 2008 and September 28, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash
flows, and stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss) for each of the years in the
three-year period ended October 3, 2008. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15 of the 2008
Form 10-K. We also have audited Skyworks Solutions Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of October 3, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Skyworks Solutions, Inc.’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule, and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. as of October 3, 2008 and
September 28, 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended October 3, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our
opinion, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of October 3, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (“Skyworks” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets a broad
range of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors that enable wireless connectivity.
Our power amplifiers (PAs), front-end modules (FEMs) and integrated radio frequency (RF) solutions
can be found in many of the cellular handsets sold by the world’s leading manufacturers. Leveraging
our core analog technologies, we also offer a diverse portfolio of linear integrated circuits (ICs)
that support automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, industrial and medical applications.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title, in accordance with
the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer. Revenue from license fees and
intellectual property is recognized when these fees are due and payable, and all other
criteria of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue
Recognition

, have been met. We ship
product on consignment to certain customers and only recognize revenue when the customer notifies
us that the inventory has been consumed. Revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where
the earnings process is incomplete. Certain product sales are made to electronic component
distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and/or a right of return on unsold
products. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical
experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our estimates, and additional allowances would be
required.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

All majority owned subsidiaries are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and
all intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.

FISCAL YEAR

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2008 consisted of 53
weeks and ended on October 3, 2008. The extra week occurred in the fourth quarter and the Company
does not believe it had a material impact on its results from
operations. Fiscal years 2007 and 2006 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on
September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based upon currently
available information. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents include cash deposited in demand deposits at banks and highly liquid
investments with original maturities of 90 days or less as well as commercial paper with original
maturities of 90 days or less.



INVESTMENTS

The Company’s investments are classified as available for sale. These investments consist of an
auction rate security (ARS) which has long-term underlying maturities (ranging from 20 to 40
years). Due to the recent disruptions in the credit markets the dutch auction process that normally
would allow the Company to sell the security every 28-35 days has failed since August 2007. This
investment and the auction rate security market is illiquid at this time. During the fiscal year
ended October 3, 2008, the Company performed a comprehensive valuation and discounted cash flow
analysis on the ARS. The Company concluded the value of the ARS was $2.3 million thus the carrying
value of these securities was reduced by $0.9 million, reflecting this change in fair value. The
Company assessed the decline in fair value to be temporary and recorded this reduction in
shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company will continue to closely
monitor the ARS and evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment in each reporting period.

RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash is primarily used to collateralize the Company’s obligation under a receivables
purchase agreement under which it has agreed to sell from time to time certain of its accounts
receivable to Skyworks USA, Inc. (“Skyworks USA”), a wholly-owned special purpose entity that is
fully consolidated for accounting purposes. Concurrently, Skyworks USA entered into an agreement
with Wachovia Bank, N.A. providing for a $50 million credit facility (“Facility Agreement’’)
secured by the purchased accounts receivable. For further information regarding the Facility
Agreement, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. The Company provides for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The recoverability of inventories is
assessed through an on-going review of inventory levels in relation to sales backlog and forecasts,
product marketing plans and product life cycles. When the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable
demand (generally in excess of twelve months), the value of such inventory that is not expected to
be sold at the time of the review is written down. The amount of the write-down is the excess of
historical cost over estimated realizable value (generally zero).

Once established, these write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the
excess inventory. If actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by
management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Some or all of the inventories that
have been written-down may be retained and made available for sale. In the event that actual demand
is higher than originally projected, a portion of these inventories may be able to be sold in the
future. Inventories that have been written-down and are identified as obsolete are generally
scrapped.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method. Significant renewals and betterments are
capitalized and equipment taken out of service is written off. Maintenance and repairs, as well as
renewals of a minor amount, are expensed as incurred.

Estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes are 5 to 30 years for buildings and
improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
over the lesser of the economic life or the life of the associated lease.

VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Carrying values for long-lived assets and definite lived intangible assets, which excludes
goodwill, are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances
warrant in connection with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.
Impairment
reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset or asset group may not be recoverable.



The
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition. The estimate of cash flows is based
upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance. The
Company’s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among
other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to the Company’s business model
or changes in its operating performance. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows (excluding
interest) is less than the carrying value of an asset or asset group, the Company recognizes an
impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the
asset or asset group. Fair value is determined using discounted cash flows.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. The
goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first step of the impairment analysis compares
the Company’s fair value to its net book value to determine if there is an indicator of impairment.
In determining fair value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of several valuation methodologies,
although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value. The Company calculates
fair value using the average market price of its common stock over a seven-day period surrounding
the annual impairment testing date of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and the number of
shares of common stock outstanding on the date of the annual impairment test (the first day of the
fourth fiscal quarter). If the assessment in the first step indicates impairment then the Company
performs step two. Step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its
carrying amount in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for a business combination. If
the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized
equal to that excess. Intangible assets are tested for impairment using an estimate of discounted
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. We test our goodwill and other intangible
assets for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim
periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible
assets may be impaired. Indicators such as unexpected adverse business conditions, economic
factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel, and
acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.

DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS

Financing costs are capitalized as an asset on the Company’s balance sheet and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the financing. If debt is extinguished early, a proportionate
amount of deferred financing costs is charged to earnings.

INCOME TAXES

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. This method also requires the
recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that
realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

The carrying value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets assumes that the Company will be able
to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and
assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be
required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in
additional income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. Management
evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation
allowance quarterly. Likewise, in the event that the Company was to determine that it would be able
to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an
adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of
goodwill in the period such determination was made.



It was previously the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of all its
foreign subsidiaries in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23,

Accounting
for Income Taxes – Special Areas

. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, the Company
reversed its policy of permanently reinvesting the earnings of its Mexican business. For the fiscal year
ended October 3, 2008, U.S. income tax was provided on current earnings attributable to our operations in
Mexico. No provision has been made for U.S. federal, state, or additional foreign income taxes that would
be due upon the actual or deemed distribution of undistributed earnings of the other foreign subsidiaries,
which have been, or are, intended to be, permanently reinvested.

On November 10, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123(R)-3,

Transition Election
Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards
the (“FASB Staff
Position”).

The Company adopted the alternative transition method provided in the FASB Staff
Position for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123(R) during the
year ended September 29, 2006. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish
the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool (“APIC pool”) related to the tax
effects of employee share-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool
and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee share-based compensation
awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). Under the simplified method the
Company’s beginning APIC pool is zero and the ending APIC pool balance at October 3, 2008
remains zero.

The calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing
uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. With the implementation effective September 29, 2007, Financial
 Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

, clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in
 income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in  a tax return.

We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues
in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our recognition threshold and measurement attribute of whether
it is more likely than not that the positions we have taken in tax filings will be sustained upon tax audit, and the extent
 to which, additional taxes would be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of
 the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which it is determined the
liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment,
 a further charge to expense would result.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term
debt and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to short-term maturities of these assets
and liabilities. Fair values of long-term debt and investments are based on quoted market prices if
available, and if not available a fair value is determined through a discounted cash flow analysis
at the date of measurement.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(R)”) which requires the measurement and recognition of
compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including
employee stock options, employee stock purchases related to the Company’s 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, restricted stock and other special equity awards based on estimated fair values. The
Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the
application of the applicable accounting standard as of October 1, 2005, the first day of the
Company’s fiscal year 2006.

The fair value of stock-based awards is amortized over the requisite service period, which is
defined as the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an
award. The Company uses a straight-line attribution method for all grants that include only a
service condition. Due to the existence of a market condition, certain restricted stock grants are
expensed over the service period for each separately vesting tranche.



Share-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion
of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Share-based
compensation expense recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the
fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 included compensation expense for share-based payment awards
granted on or before, but not yet vested as of, September 30, 2005, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”) and compensation expense for the share-based payment awards
granted subsequent to September 30, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). As share-based compensation expense recognized in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 is based on awards
ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123(R) requires
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company elected to retain its method of valuation for share-based
awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (“Black-Scholes model”) which was also
previously used for the Company’s pro forma information required under SFAS 123. The Company’s
determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a
number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to;
the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected
employee stock option exercise behaviors. For more complex awards with market-based performance
conditions, the Company employs a Monte Carlo simulation method which calculates many potential
outcomes for an award and establishes fair value based on the most likely outcome.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

The Company accounts for comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income

(“SFAS No. 130”). SFAS No. 130 is a financial statement
presentation standard that requires the Company to disclose non-owner changes included in equity
but not included in net income or loss. Accumulated comprehensive loss presented in the financial
statements consists of adjustments to the Company’s auction rate securities and minimum pension
liability as follows (in thousands):

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

SFAS 157

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”) which defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets carried at fair value, and years beginning after November 15, 2008 for non-financial assets not carried at fair value.  The Company has
not yet determined the impact that SFAS 157 will have on its results from operations or financial
position.

SFAS 159

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”) including an amendment of SFAS No. 115, which permits entities
to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not
currently required to be measured at fair



value. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS 159
will not have a material impact on the Company’s results from operations or financial position.

SFAS 141(R)

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business
Combinations

(“SFAS 141(R)”)

.

SFAS
141(R) applies to any transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business
combination. Where applicable, SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the
acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree and goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase. In addition, SFAS 141(R)
determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the
nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement is to be applied
prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company will evaluate the impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on its Consolidated Financial Statements in the event future business combinations are contemplated.

SFAS 160

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 amends ARB 51 to establish accounting
and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation
of a subsidiary. It also amends certain of ARB 51’s consolidation procedures for consistency with
the requirements of SFAS 141(R). This statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The statement shall be applied
prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is initially adopted.
The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to impact its results of operations or
financial position because the Company does not have any minority interests.

SFAS 161

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161

, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133

(“SFAS 161”)

.

SFAS 161 amends FASB Statement No.
133 to require enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities thereby
improving the transparency of financial reporting. Entities are required to provide enhanced
disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related
interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This Statement is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008,
with early application encouraged. The Company does not currently hold any positions in derivative
instruments or participate in hedging activities and thus does not expect the adoption of SFAS 161
to have any impact on its results of operations or financial position.

FSP No. 142-3

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 142-3,

Determination of the Useful
Life of Intangible Assets

(“FSP 142-3”).  FSP 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing
renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible
assets under FASB Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

.  This new guidance
applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other
assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions. FSP 142-3 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008.  Early
adoption is prohibited. The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP 142-3 to have any material impact on its results of operations or financial position.

FSP No. APB 14-1

In
May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB 14-1,

Accounting for Convertible
Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion
(Including Partial Cash Settlement)

(“FSB APB 14-1”).
This FSP alters the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either
mandatory or optional cash settlements.  FSP APB 14-1 is expected to impact the Company’s
accounting for its 2007 Convertible Notes and previously held Junior Notes. This FSP requires
registrants with specified convertible note features to recognize (non-cash) interest



expense based on the market rate for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature.
Furthermore, pursuant to its retrospective accounting treatment, the FSP requires prior period
interest expense recognition. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008.  The Company is currently evaluating
FSP APB 14-1 and the impact that it will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Company is not required to adopt FSP APB 14-1 until the first quarter of fiscal 2010.

FSP No. 133-1 and FIN 45-4

In
September 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 133-1,

Disclosures about Credit
Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133

(“FSP 133-1”) and FASB
Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161. This FSP
amends FASB Statement No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

to
require disclosures by sellers of credit derivatives, including credit derivatives embedded in a
hybrid instrument. This FSP also amends FASB Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,

to
require an additional disclosure about the current status of the payment/performance risk of a
guarantee. Further, this FSP clarifies the Board’s intent about the effective date of FASB
Statement No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. The provisions
of this FSP that amend Statement 133 and Interpretation 45 shall be effective for reporting periods
(annual or interim) ending after November 15, 2008. The Company does not currently hold any
positions in derivative instruments or participate in hedging activities and thus does not expect
the adoption of FSP 133-1 and FIN 45-4 to have any impact on its results of operations or
financial position.

FSP No. FAS 157-3

In
October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair
Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not
Active

(“FSP 157-3”) which clarifies the
application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key
considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset. SFAS 157 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets carried at fair value, and years beginning after November 15, 2008 for

non-financial

assets not carried at fair value.  The Company has
not yet determined the impact that SFAS 157 will have on its results from operations or financial
position.

3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

In October 2007, the Company paid $32.6 million in cash to acquire certain assets from two separate
companies. The Company acquired raw materials, die bank, finished goods, proprietary GaAs PA/FEM
designs and related intellectual property in a business combination from Freescale Semiconductor.
We also acquired sixteen fundamental HBT and RF MEMs patents in an asset acquisition from another
company. The purchase accounting on these acquisitions was finalized in March 2008.

The purchase prices as of October 23, 2007 were allocated based upon the fair value of the tangible
and intangible assets acquired in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) 141,

Business Combinations

. Based upon those calculations, the Company has definitively
concluded that customer relationships have a fair value of $8.5 million, order backlog has a fair
value of $1.6 million, developed technology has a fair value of $1.3 million, the Master Foundry
Services agreement has a fair value of $0.9 million, patents have a fair value of $0.9 million,
inventories have a fair value of $5.6 million and the remaining purchase price of $13.8 million is
allocated to goodwill. The intangible assets will be amortized over periods ranging from 0.5 years
to 5 years.

The Company’s primary reasons for the above acquisitions were to expand its market share in power
amplifiers and front end modules at certain existing customers, and increase the probability of
future design wins with these customers. The significant factors that resulted in recognition of
goodwill in one of the transactions were: (a) the purchase price was based on cash flow projections
assuming the sale of the acquired inventory and the sale of the Company’s next generation product
(a derivative of the acquired inventory); and (b) there were very few tangible and identifiable
intangible assets that qualified for recognition.



4. AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES

The Company accounts for its investment in debt and equity securities in accordance with SFAS No.
115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, and classifies them as
“available for sale”. At October 3, 2008, these securities consist of $3.2 million in amortized
cost of auction rate securities (“ARS”), which are long-term debt instruments which provide
liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets interest rates each month. The recent
uncertainties in the credit markets have disrupted the liquidity of this process resulting in
failed auctions.

During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, the Company performed a comprehensive valuation and
discounted cash flow analysis on the ARS. The Company concluded the value of the ARS was $2.3
million thus the carrying value of these securities was reduced by $0.9 million, reflecting this
change in fair value. The Company assessed the decline in fair value to be temporary and recorded
this reduction in shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company will
continue to closely monitor the ARS and evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment in each
reporting period. The Company holds no other auction rate securities.

ARS were classified in prior periods as current assets under “Short-term Investments”. Given the
failed auctions, the Company’s ARS are considered to be illiquid until there is a successful
auction. Accordingly, the remaining ARS balance has been reclassified to non-current other assets.

Marketable securities as of September 28, 2007 were categorized as available for sale and consisted
solely of auction rate securities with a fair value equal to amortized cost.

In October 2007, the Company paid $32.6 million in cash to acquire certain assets from two separate
companies resulting in the allocation of approximately $13.8 million to goodwill. For additional
information regarding these acquisitions see Note 3, Business Combinations.

Goodwill was reduced by $11.0 million in fiscal 2008 and $12.5 million in fiscal 2007 as a result
of the realization of deferred tax assets. The benefit from the recognition of a portion of these
deferred items reduces the carrying value of goodwill instead of reducing income tax expense.
Accordingly, future realization of certain deferred tax assets will reduce the carrying value of
goodwill. The remaining deferred tax assets that could reduce goodwill in future periods are $7.6
million as of October 3, 2008.

The Company tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of its fourth fiscal
quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of
goodwill may be impaired. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2008
and determined that as of July 1, 2008, its goodwill was not impaired.

On March 2, 2007, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible
subordinated notes (“2007 Convertible Notes”). The offering contained two tranches. The first
tranche consisted of $100.0 million of 1.25% convertible subordinated notes due March 2010. The
second tranche consisted of $100.0 million of 1.50% convertible subordinated notes due March 2012.
The conversion price of the 2007 Convertible Notes is 105.0696 shares per $1,000 principal amount
of notes to be redeemed, which is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately $9.52 per
share, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the conversion date. Holders may require the
Company to repurchase the 2007 Convertible Notes upon a change in control of the Company. The
Company pays interest in cash semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. It
has been the Company’s historical practice to cash settle the principal and interest components of
convertible debt instruments, and it is our intention to continue to do so in the future, including
settlement of the 2007 Convertible Notes. During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, the
Company redeemed $50.0 million and $12.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.25% and
1.50% convertible subordinated notes, respectively, at an average
redemption price of $109.02. A premium of approximately $5.8 million, along with approximately $1.0 million in deferred financing
costs was recorded as a charge against earnings in fiscal 2008.

Junior Notes represent the Company’s 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due November 2007. Prior
to repayment, these Junior Notes were convertible into 110.4911 shares of common stock per $1,000
principal balance, which is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately $9.05 per share.
The Company paid interest in cash semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year.
During the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007, the Company redeemed $130.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of the Junior Notes at a redemption price of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of
notes plus $2.3 million in accrued and unpaid interest. The fair value of the Company’s Junior
Notes approximated $50.2 million at September 28, 2007. The Company retired the remaining
$49.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the Junior Notes, plus $1.2 million in accrued and
unpaid interest, on the due date of November 15, 2007.

On December 21, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position
Emerging Issues Task Force 00-19-2 (“FSP EITF 00-19-2”). FSP EITF 00-19-2 specifies that the
contingent obligation to make future payments, or otherwise transfer consideration under a
registration payment arrangement, should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with
FASB Statement No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

(“FASB 5”). The Company adopted FSP EITF 00-19-2
on September 29, 2007. The Company agreed to file a shelf registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) not later than 120 days after the first date of
original issuance of the 2007 Convertible Notes. The Company agreed to utilize commercially
reasonable efforts to have this shelf registration statement declared effective not later than 180
days after the first date of original issuance of the notes, and to keep it effective until the
earliest of: 1) two years from the effective date of the shelf registration statement; 2) the date
when all registrable securities have been registered under the Securities Act and disposed of; and
3) the date on which all registrable securities held by non-affiliates are eligible to be sold to
the public pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act. The Company filed the shelf
registration statement within



120 days of the original issuance of the 2007 Convertible Notes and the shelf registration
statement was declared effective within 180 days after the first date of original issuance of the
notes. If the shelf registration statement ceases to be effective within two years from the
effective date of the shelf registration statement the Company will be obligated to pay an
additional 0.25% interest per annum for the first 90 days after the occurrence of the registration
default and at the rate of 0.50% per annum thereafter. The Company has concluded that it is not
probable that a contingent liability has been incurred at October 3, 2008 pursuant to the
application of FASB 5 and thus has not recorded a liability.

receivable. As a part of the consolidation, any interest incurred by Skyworks USA related to monies
it borrows under the Facility Agreement is recorded as interest expense in the Company’s results of
operations. The Company performs collections and administrative functions on behalf of Skyworks
USA. The Company renewed the Facility Agreement on July 11, 2008 for a one year term. Interest
related to the Facility Agreement is at LIBOR plus 0.75%. As of October 3, 2008, Skyworks USA had
borrowed $50.0 million under this agreement.

During the
fiscal years ended October 3, 2008 and September 28, 2007, the
valuation allowance was reduced by $11.0 million and $12.5 million,
respectively, resulting from the partial recognition of certain
acquired tax benefits that were subject to a valuation allowance at
the time of acquisition, the realization of which required a
reduction of goodwill. Of this amount, $7.0 million and $0.0 million
is included in the charge in lieu of tax expense in the table above
for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, and $4.0 million and
$12.5 million is included in the change in the valuation allowance

In
accordance with SFAS 109,

Accounting for Income
Taxes

, management has determined that it is
more likely than not that a portion of our historic and current year income tax benefits will not
be realized. As of October 3, 2008, the Company has established a valuation allowance for deferred
tax assets of $82.9 million. The net change in the valuation allowance of $68.4 million during
fiscal 2008 is principally due to the recognition of tax benefits offset against current year
taxable income of $83.4 million and a reduction in the end of year valuation allowance of $40.0
million based on our assessment of the amount of deferred tax assets that are realizable on a more
likely than not basis. When recognized, the tax benefits relating to any future reversal of the
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at October 3, 2008 will be accounted for as follows:
approximately $71.4 million will be recognized as an income tax benefit, $7.6 million will be
recognized as a reduction to goodwill and $3.9 million will be recognized as an increase to
shareholders’ equity for certain tax deductions from employee stock options.

Based on
the Company’s evaluation of the realizability of its United
States net deferred tax assets and other future deductible items through the generation of future taxable income,
$40.0 million of the Company’s valuation allowance was reversed at October 3, 2008. The amount
reversed consisted of $36.4 million recognized as income tax benefit, and $3.6 million recognized
as a reduction to goodwill. Deferred tax assets have been recognized for foreign operations when
management believes they will more likely than not be recovered during the carryforward period. We
will continue to assess our valuation allowance in future periods.

In 2006, the Company reorganized its Mexico operations. As a result, the long term deferred tax
asset relating to the impairment of Mexico assets was written off because the machinery and
equipment was transferred to a United States company. The write-off increased tax expense by $14.6
million net of a deferred tax charge associated with this reorganization. The deferred tax asset
allowable for United States tax purposes is included in the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets
subject to a valuation allowance as previously discussed.

As of October 3, 2008, the Company has United States federal net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $130.6 million, which will expire at various dates through 2027 and aggregate state
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.4 million, which will expire at various dates
through 2017. The Company also has United States federal and state income tax credit carryforwards
of approximately $56.3 million. The United States federal tax credits expire at various dates
through 2028. The state tax credits relate primarily to California research tax credits which can
be carried forward indefinitely.

No provision has been made for United States federal, state, or additional foreign income taxes
related to approximately $8.9 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have
been or are intended to be permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the United
States federal income tax liability, if any, which would be payable if such earnings were not
permanently reinvested.



The
Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

as of the beginning of fiscal year 2008. As of the date
of adoption, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $7.3 million. Included in this
amount is $0.6 million which would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. As of October 3,
2008, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits totaled $7.9 million. Included in this amount
is $0.6 million which would impact the effective tax rate, if
recognized. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits would not impact
the effective tax rate, if recognized, due to the Company’s
valuation allowance. There are no positions
which we anticipate could change within the next twelve months.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as
follows (in thousands):

The Company’s major tax
 jurisdictions as of October 3, 2008 for FIN 48 are the U.S., California, and
Iowa. For the U.S., the Company has open tax years dating back to fiscal year 1998 due to the
carryforward of tax attributes. For California, the Company has open tax years dating back to
fiscal year 2002 due to the carryforward of tax attributes. For Iowa, the Company has open tax
years dating back to fiscal year 2002 due to the carryforward of tax attributes.

During the year ended October 3, 2008, the statute of limitations period expired relating to an
unrecognized tax benefit. The expiration of the statute of limitations period resulted in the
recognition of $0.6 million of previously unrecognized tax benefit, which impacted the effective
tax rate, and $0.5 million of accrued interest related to this tax position was reversed during the
year. Including this reversal, total year-to-date accrued interest related to the Company’s
unrecognized tax benefits was a benefit of $0.4 million.

The Company is authorized to issue (1) 525,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.25 per
share, and (2) 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value.

Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by the
Company’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. Dividends may not be
paid on common stock unless all accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, have been paid or
declared and set aside. In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the
holders of common stock will be entitled to share pro rata in the assets remaining after payment to
creditors and after payment of the liquidation preference plus any unpaid dividends to holders of
any outstanding preferred stock.

Each holder of the Company’s common stock is entitled to one vote for each such share outstanding
in the holder’s name. No holder of common stock is entitled to cumulate votes in voting for
directors. The Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that,
unless otherwise determined by the Company’s Board of Directors, no holder of common stock has any
preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for any stock of any class which the Company may issue or
sell.

In March 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 4.3 million of its common shares for $30.1
million as authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Company has no publicly disclosed
stock repurchase plans.

At October 3, 2008, the Company had 170,322,804 shares of common stock issued and 165,591,830
shares outstanding.



PREFERRED STOCK

The Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits the Company to issue
up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and with rights and preferences
that may be fixed or designated by the Company’s Board of Directors without any further action by
the Company’s stockholders. The designation, powers, preferences, rights and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions of the preferred stock of each series will be fixed by the certificate
of designation relating to such series, which will specify the terms of the preferred stock. At
October 3, 2008, the Company had no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.

Share-based compensation for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 includes approximately $1.7
million related to the portion of fiscal 2008 short-term management incentive compensation that exceeded
target metrics that was paid in unrestricted common stock after year
end. The Company anticipates an immaterial amount of share dilution as a
result of this arrangement.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company maintains a domestic and an international employee stock purchase plan. Under these
plans, eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of
compensation. The price per share is the lower of 85% of the market price at the beginning or end
of each offering period (generally six months). The plans provide for purchases by employees of up
to an aggregate of 8.1 million shares through December 31, 2012. Shares of common stock purchased
under these plans in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006 were 790,556, 830,103, and 835,621, respectively.
At October 3, 2008, there are 2.7 million shares available for purchase. The Company recognized
compensation expense of $1.6 million, $1.3 million, and $1.7 million for the fiscal years ended
October 3, 2008, September 28, 2007, and September 29, 2006, respectively.

Employee and Director Stock Option Plans

The Company has share-based compensation plans under which employees and directors may be granted
options to purchase common stock. Options are generally granted with exercise prices at not less
than the fair market value on the grant date, generally vest over 4 years and expire 7 or 10 years
after the grant date. As of October 3, 2008, a total of 70.6 million shares are authorized for
grant under the Company’s share-based compensation plans, with 24.7 million options outstanding.
The number of common shares reserved for granting of future awards to employees and directors under
these plans was 9.3 million at October 3, 2008. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense on
stock options at October 3, 2008 was $17.0 million, and the weighted average period over which the
cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 2.2 years.

As of October 3, 2008, the Company had 10 equity compensation plans under which our equity
securities are authorized for issuance to our employees and/or directors:



-

the 1994 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan

-

the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan

plans was approved by our stockholders.

Restricted
Stock Awards with Service Conditions

The Company’s share-based compensation plans provide for awards of restricted shares of common
stock and other stock-based incentive awards to officers, other employees and certain
non-employees. Restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates during
the prescribed retention period (generally within four years of the date of award).

The Company granted 50,000, 38,000, and 106,000 restricted shares in the fiscal years ended October
3, 2008, September 28, 2007, and September 29, 2006, respectively, with a four year graded vesting.
The remaining unrecognized compensation expense on restricted stock with service conditions
outstanding at October 3, 2008 was $0.7 million, and the weighted average period over which the
cost is expected to be recognized is 3.0 years.

The Company also granted 20,000 and 446,000 shares of restricted common stock during the fiscal
years ended September 28, 2007, and September 29, 2006, respectively, that will vest over a
three-year period (50% at the end of year 1, and 25% at the end of both year 2 and year 3). As of
October 3, 2008, 75% of these grants have vested. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense
on restricted stock with service conditions outstanding at October 3, 2008 was $0.5 million. The
weighted average period over which the cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.0
years.

In addition, during the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, under the new 2008 Director Long-Term
Incentive Plan, the Company issued a total of 100,000 restricted stock awards to Directors with a
three-year graded vesting. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense on restricted stock
with service conditions outstanding at October 3, 2008 was $0.5 million. The weighted average
period over which the cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.9 years.

Restricted Stock Awards with Market Conditions and Service Conditions

The Company granted 576,688 and 606,488 shares of restricted common stock during the fiscal years
ended October 3, 2008, and September 28, 2007, respectively, with service and market conditions on
vesting. If the restricted stock recipient meets the service condition but not the market condition
in years 1, 2, 3 and 4, then the restricted stock vests 0% at the end of year 1, 33.3% at the end
of year 2, 33.3% at the end of year 3 and 33.3% at the end of year 4. The market condition allows
for accelerated vesting of the award as of the first, second and if not previously accelerated, the
third anniversaries of the grant date. Specifically, if the Company’s stock performance meets or
exceeds the 60

th

percentile of its selected peer group for the years ended on each of
the first three anniversaries of the grant date, then 33.3% of the award vests upon each
anniversary (up to 100%). The Company calculated a derived service period of approximately 3.0
years using a Monte-Carlo simulation to simulate a range of possible future stock prices for the
Company and the members of the Company’s selected peer group.

The Company granted 493,128 shares of restricted common stock with service and market conditions on
vesting during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2006. The market condition allows for
accelerated vesting of the award as of the first, second, and, if not previously accelerated, the
third anniversary of the grant date. Specifically, if the



Company’s stock performance meets or exceeds the 60

th

percentile of its selected peer
group for the years ended on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, then 50% of
the award vests upon each anniversary (up to 100%). If the restricted stock recipient meets the
service condition but not the market condition in years 1, 2 and 3, then the restricted stock vests
50% at the end of year 3 and 50% at the end of year 4. The Company calculated a derived service
period of approximately 2.5 years using a Monte-Carlo simulation to simulate a range of possible
future stock prices for the Company and the members of the Company’s selected peer group. As of
November 8, 2006, and November 8, 2007, the Company’s stock performance had exceeded the

th

percentile of its selected peer group resulting in the vesting of 100% of the
aforementioned shares.

The remaining unrecognized compensation expense on restricted stock with market and service
conditions outstanding at October 3, 2008 was $3.8 million. The weighted average period over which
the cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.6 years.

Performance Units with Milestone-Based Performance Conditions

The Company granted 160,500, 223,200 and 222,000 performance units with milestone-based performance
conditions to non-executives during the fiscal years ended October 3, 2008, September 28, 2007, and
September 29, 2006, respectively. The performance units will convert to common stock at such time
that the performance conditions are deemed to be achieved. The performance units will be expensed
over implicit performance periods ranging from 11-23 months. The Company will utilize both
quantitative and qualitative criteria to judge whether the milestones are probable of achievement.
If the milestones are deemed to be not probable of achievement, no expense will be recognized until
such time as they become probable of achievement. If a milestone is initially deemed probable of
achievement and subsequent to that date it is deemed to be not probable of achievement, the Company
will discontinue recording expense on the units. If the milestone is deemed to be improbable of
achievement, any expense recorded on those performance units will be reversed. As of the fiscal
year ended October 3, 2008, September 28, 2007, and September 29, 2006, the fair value of the
performance units at the date of grant were $1.4 million, $1.5 million, and $1.2 million,
respectively. We issued 100,466 shares, 103,688 shares, and 49,000 shares in fiscal 2008, fiscal
2007, and fiscal 2006, respectively as a result of milestone achievement. In addition, certain
other milestones were deemed to be probable of achievement thus, we recorded total compensation
expense of $1.2 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million in the fiscal years ended October 3, 2008,
September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, respectively.

The Company awarded 725,000 performance shares based on future stock price appreciation to
executives during the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008. Each executive has the ability to earn
Nominal (50% of Target), Target, Stretch (150% of Target), or no shares depending on performance within a three year period. On
November 6, 2007, a base price was set (based on the trailing 60 day average stock price) and stock
price hurdles were set (based on appreciation of 20%, 40% and 60% of the base price). Actual
performance is measured using a rolling 60 day average and shares are locked in when Skyworks meets
or exceeds a stock price hurdle. Shares are not cumulative and each targeted stock price is a
“hurdle” (there is no interpolation for performance between hurdles). Locked in shares will be
delivered to the executive at the end of the three year period as long as the executive is actively
employed. If the Nominal stock price hurdle (1st Hurdle) is not met or exceeded by the end of the
three year period then the shares expire. If a change of control occurs within the three year
performance period then the executive will receive the higher of the actual amount earned (locked
in) or Target (the last day of the 60 day average will include the closing price on the date of the
transaction)

.

As of the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, the fair value of the performance units
at the date of grant was $7.5 million. At October 3, 2008, the Company had recorded total
compensation expense of $2.3 million.

Share-Based Compensation Plans for Directors

The Company has four share-based compensation plans under which options and restricted stock have
been granted for non-employee directors — the 1994 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, the 1997
Directors’ Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, the Directors’ 2001 Stock Option Plan, and the 2008
Directors’ Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the four plans, a total of 2.2 million shares have been
authorized for option grants. Under the current 2008 Directors’ Long-Term Incentive Plan, a total
of 0.6 million shares are available for new grants as of October 3, 2008. The 2008 Directors’
Long-Term Incentive Plan is structured to provide options and restricted common stock to
non-employee directors as follows: a new director receives a total of 25,000 options and 12,500
shares of restricted common stock upon becoming a member of the Board; and continuing directors
receive 12,500 shares of restricted common stock after



each Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Under this plan, the option price is the fair market value at
the time the option is granted. All options granted are exercisable at 25% per year beginning one
year from the date of grant. The maximum contractual term of the director plans is 10 years. At
October 3, 2008, a total of 0.9 million options at a weighted average exercise price of $9.75 per
share are outstanding under these four plans, and 0.7 million shares were exercisable at a weighted
average exercise price of $10.74 per share. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense on
director stock options at October 3, 2008 was $0.4 million and the weighted average period over
which the cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.8 years. There were 60,000 options
exercised under these plans for both the fiscal years ended October 3, 2008 and September 28, 2007.
There were no options exercised during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2006. The
above-mentioned activity for the share-based compensation plans for directors is included in the
option tables below.

The Company used an arithmetic average of historical volatility and implied volatility to calculate
its expected volatility during the year ended October 3, 2008. Historical volatility was determined
by calculating the mean reversion of the weekly-adjusted closing stock price over the 6.23 years
between June 25, 2002 and September 19,



2008. The implied volatility was calculated by analyzing the 52-week minimum and maximum prices of
publicly traded call options on the Company’s common stock. The Company concluded that an
arithmetic average of these two calculations provided for the most reasonable estimate of expected
volatility under the guidance of SFAS 123(R).

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed Treasury bill interest rates
(risk free) appropriate for the term of the Company’s employee stock options.

The expected life of employee stock options represents a calculation based upon the historical
exercise, cancellation and forfeiture experience for the Company over the 5.25 years between June
25, 2002 and September 28, 2007. The Company deemed that exercise, cancellation and forfeiture
experience in 2007 was consistent with historical norms thus expected life was not recalculated at
October 3, 2008. The Company determined that it had two populations with unique exercise behavior.
These populations included stock options with a contractual life of 7 years and 10 years,
respectively.

As share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the

awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for annualized estimated forfeitures of
11.79%, 12.85%, and 8.59%, respectively. SFAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the
time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from
those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.

11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN, PENSIONS AND OTHER RETIREE BENEFITS

The Company maintains a 401(k) plan covering substantially all of its employees. All of the
Company’s employees who are at least 21 years old are eligible to receive discretionary Company
contributions under the 401(k) plan. Discretionary Company contributions are determined by the
Board of Directors and may be in the form of cash or the Company’s stock. The Company has generally
contributed a match of up to 4.0% of an employee’s annual eligible compensation. For fiscal
years 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company contributed and recognized expense for 0.6 million, 0.7
million, and 0.8 million shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock valued at $5.0
million, $4.8 million, and $4.1 million, respectively, to fund the Company’s obligation under the
401(k) plan.

In fiscal 2008, the Company began phasing out its funding of retiree medical benefits. On
September 18, 2007, a letter was mailed to the participants of the Retiree Health Plan informing
them of the Company’s plan to phase out



the Plan over a three year period effective January 2008. Skyworks contributions will be phased
out on the following basis:

Calendar

Year

Skyworks


Employer portion of contribution will be reduced by 20%


Employer portion of contribution will be reduced by 40%


Employer portion of contribution will be reduced by 80%


Employer portion of contribution will be reduced by 100%

The Company incurred net periodic benefit costs of $0.1 million for pension benefits and $0.1
million for retiree medical benefits in each of the fiscal years ending October 3, 2008, September
28, 2007, and September 29, 2006.

As discussed in Note 2, we adopted SFAS 158 on September 28, 2007, on the required prospective
basis. In accordance with SFAS 158, the funded status as of September 28, 2007, is recorded as a
liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The funded status of the Company’s

The Company has various operating leases primarily for computer equipment and buildings. Rent
expense amounted to $8.6 million, $8.5 million, and $9.3 million in fiscal years ended October 3,
2008, September 28, 2007, and September 29, 2006, respectively. Purchase options may be exercised,
at fair market value, at various times for some of these leases. Future minimum payments under
these non-cancelable leases are as follows (in thousands):

The Company is attempting to sublet certain properties that were vacated upon the exit of the
baseband product area and, if successful, future operating lease commitments will be partially
offset by proceeds received from the subleases.

In addition, the Company has entered into licensing agreements for intellectual property rights and
maintenance and support services. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company is
committed to making aggregate payments of $3.9 million, $2.3 million, $2.1 million, and $0.4
million in fiscal years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively.

13. CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been, and may in the future be,
instituted or asserted against the Company, including those pertaining to patent infringement,
intellectual property, environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment and
contractual matters.



Additionally, the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of
intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future
assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are
important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their
technology. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims
or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company. Intellectual property disputes often
have a risk of injunctive relief, which, if imposed against the Company, could materially and
adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, or results of operations.

From time to time we are involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We
believe that there is no such ordinary course litigation pending that will have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business.

14. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES

The Company has no guarantees. The Company generally indemnifies its customers from third-party
intellectual property infringement litigation claims related to its products, and, on occasion,
also provides other indemnities related to product sales. In connection with certain facility
leases, the Company has indemnified its lessors for certain claims arising from the facility or the
lease.

The Company indemnifies its directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws
of the state of Delaware. The duration of the indemnities varies, and in many cases is indefinite.
The indemnities to customers in connection with product sales generally are subject to limits based
upon the amount of the related product sales and in many cases are subject to geographic and other
restrictions. In certain instances, the Company’s indemnities do not provide for any limitation of
the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. The Company has not
recorded any liability for these indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

2006 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER

On September 29, 2006, the Company exited its baseband product area in order to focus on its core
business encompassing linear products, power amplifiers, front-end modules and radio solutions. The
Company recorded various charges associated with this action. In total, the Company recorded
charges of $90.4 million which included the following:

The Company recorded $13.1 million related to severance and benefits, $7.4 million related to the
write-down of technology licenses and design software, $4.2 million related to the impairment of
certain long-lived assets and $2.3 million related to other charges. These charges total $27.0
million and are recorded in restructuring and special charges.

The Company also recorded charges of $35.1 million in bad debt expense principally for two baseband
product area customers, $23.3 million of excess and obsolete baseband and other inventory charges
and reserves and $5.0 million related to baseband product area revenue adjustments. These charges
were recorded against selling, general and administrative expenses, cost of goods sold and
revenues, respectively.

The Company recorded additional restructuring charges of $4.9 million related to the exit of the
baseband product area during the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007. These charges consist of
$4.5 million relating to the exit of certain operating leases, $0.5 million relating to additional
severance, $1.4 million related to the write-off of



technology licenses and design software, offset by a $1.5 million benefit related to the reversal
of a reserve originally recorded to account for an engineering vendor charge.

During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008, the Company recorded additional restructuring charges
of $0.6 million relating to lease obligations due to the closure of certain locations associated
with the baseband product area

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of equity based
awards using the treasury stock method, the Junior Notes on an if-converted basis and the 2007
Convertible Notes using the treasury stock method, if their effect is dilutive.

Equity based awards exercisable for approximately 23.0 million shares were outstanding but not
included in the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2008 as
their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Junior Notes convertible into approximately 5.5 million shares and equity based awards exercisable
for approximately 19.3 million shares were outstanding but not included in the computation of
earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007 as their effect would have been
anti-dilutive. If the Company had earned at least $78.8 million in net income for the fiscal year
ended September 28, 2007 the Junior Notes would have been dilutive to earnings per share.



In addition, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible
subordinated notes (“2007 Convertible Notes”) in March 2007. These 2007 Convertible Notes contain
cash settlement provisions, which permit the application of the treasury stock method in
determining potential share dilution of the conversion spread should the share price of the
Company’s common stock exceed $9.52. It has been the Company’s historical practice to cash settle
the principal and interest components of convertible debt instruments, and it is our intention to
continue to do so in the future, including settlement of the 2007 Convertible Notes issued in March
2007. These shares have not been included in the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal
year ended September 28, 2007 or October 3, 2008 as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
The maximum potential dilution from the settlement of the 2007 Convertible Notes would be
approximately 14.5 million shares at October 3, 2008.

Junior Notes convertible into approximately 19.8 million shares and equity based awards exercisable
for approximately 23.7 million shares were outstanding but not included in the computation of
earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2006 as their effect would have been
anti-dilutive. If the Company had earned at least $93.9 million in net income for the fiscal year
ended September 29, 2006 the Junior Notes would have been dilutive to earnings per share.

17. SEGMENT INFORMATION AND CONCENTRATIONS

In accordance with SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information

(“SFAS 131”), the Company has one reportable operating segment which designs, develops,
manufactures and markets proprietary semiconductor products, including intellectual property, for
manufacturers of wireless communication products. SFAS 131 establishes standards for the way public
business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and
in interim reports to shareholders. The method for determining what information to report is based
on management’s organization of segments within the Company for making operating decisions and
assessing financial performance. In evaluating financial performance, management uses sales and
operating profit as the measure of the segments’ profit or loss. All of the Company’s operating
segments share similar economic characteristics as they have a similar long term business model,
and have similar research and development expenses and similar selling, general and administrative
expenses, thus, the Company has concluded at October 3, 2008 that it has only one reportable
operating segment. The Company will re-assess its conclusions at least annually.

The Company’s revenues by geography do not necessarily correlate to end handset demand by region.
For example, if the Company sells a power amplifier module to a customer in South Korea, the sale
is recorded within the South Korea account although that customer, in turn, may integrate that
module into a product sold to a service provider (its customer) in Africa, China, Europe, the
Middle East, the Americas or within South Korea.



The increase in net revenues derived from China in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and
fiscal 2006 is principally due to increased sales to distributors who sell directly to Chinese end
users (namely AIT, Holystone China and Comtech) and the implementation of a global Sony Ericsson
Mobile Comm. AB hub in Hong Kong in 2007 (one of our top OEM customers).

The decrease in net revenues derived from Other Asia-Pacific in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal
2007 and fiscal 2006 is due to continued weakness at one of our OEM customers and the transitioning
of the aforementioned Sony Ericsson Mobile Comm. AB revenues to the Hong Kong hub from Other
Asia-Pacific locations.

CONCENTRATIONS

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist
principally of trade accounts receivable. Trade receivables are primarily derived from sales to
manufacturers of communications and consumer products. Ongoing credit evaluations of customers’
financial condition are performed and collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees,
are required whenever deemed necessary. As of October 3, 2008, Motorola, Inc., Samsung Electronics
Co., and Sony Ericsson Mobile Comm. AB accounted for approximately 14%, 12% and 10%, respectively,
of the Company’s gross accounts receivable.

As of
September 28, 2007, Motorola, Inc. and Sony Ericcson Mobile Comm. AB accounted for approximately

which included $4.5 million relating to the exit of certain operating leases, $0.5 million
relating to additional severance, $1.4 million related to the write-off of technology licenses
and design software, offset by a $1.5 million credit related to the reversal of a reserve
originally recorded to account for an engineering vendor charge associated with the exit of

that expires in 2008 relating to our 2002 restructuring.

19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

After the close of  fiscal 2008, we retired an additional $40.5 million of our 2007
Convertible Notes (due in 2012) at an average discounted price of
$92.58 per $100.00 of par value. These
retirements reduced the remaining principal balance on our 2007 Convertible Notes to $97.1 million.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 3, 2008. The
term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 3, 2008, our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

(b) Changes in internal controls over financial reporting.

No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October 3, 2008 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Skyworks’ internal control over
financial reporting.



Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of October 3, 2008. In making this assessment, the Company’s management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on their assessment, management concluded that, as of October 3, 2008, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on
page 48.
