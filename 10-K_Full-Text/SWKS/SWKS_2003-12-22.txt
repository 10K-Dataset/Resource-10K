ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

SUMMARY

Skyworks Solutions, Inc.
(“Skyworks” or the “Company”) is a leading wireless semiconductor
company focused exclusively on radio frequency (“RF”) and complete cellular
system solutions for mobile communications applications. We offer front-end modules, RF
subsystems and cellular systems to leading wireless handset and infrastructure customers.

From the power amplifier, through the
radio and to the baseband, we have developed one of the industry’s broadest product
portfolios including leadership switches and power amplifier modules. Additionally, we
offer a highly integrated direct conversion transceiver and have launched a comprehensive
cellular system for next generation handsets.

With our extensive product portfolio
and significant systems-level expertise, Skyworks is the ideal partner for both top-tier
wireless manufacturers and new market entrants who demand simplified architectures, faster
development cycles and fewer overall suppliers.

Skyworks was formed through the
merger (“Merger”) of the wireless business of Conexant Systems, Inc.
(“Conexant”) and Alpha Industries, Inc. (“Alpha”) on June 25, 2002.
Immediately following the Merger, the Company purchased Conexant’s semiconductor
assembly and test facility located in Mexicali, Mexico and certain related operations (the
“Mexicali Operations”). Shortly thereafter, Alpha changed its corporate name to
Skyworks Solutions, Inc. We are headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts, and have executive
offices in Irvine, California. We have design, engineering, manufacturing, marketing,
sales and service facilities throughout North America, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific
region. Our Internet address is

www.skyworksinc.com

. We make available on our
Internet website free of charge our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Section 16 filings on Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments
to those reports as soon as practicable after we electronically file such material with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The information contained in our
website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

We believe that the wireless industry
is on the verge of another substantial growth cycle. Traditional voice services offered by
wireless carriers are being rapidly supplemented or augmented by the emergence of the
next-generation wireless technologies and WiFi-based (802.11) wireless data applications.
All of these new technologies are geared to make high-speed wireless data available on
handset, PDA, notebook and other platforms in a variety of environments.

The cellular handset market has grown
significantly over the past five years despite the broad technology slowdown in 2001 and
2002. According to market research firm EMC, handset sales have increased by approximately
300% from 1997 to 2002 with volume reaching 400 million units in 2002. Exiting 2002, the
worldwide penetration rate of wireless services was at 18% and is expected to climb to 28%
by 2005. This increased penetration implies that approximately 650 million new subscribers
will begin using wireless services over the next three years, approaching the 1.8 billion
worldwide subscriber mark in 2005 – roughly a fourth of the world’s population.

In parallel, handset growth is being
driven by replacement units purchased by existing subscribers as carriers introduce
updated models, smaller form factors, added features and new applications. In particular,
color displays and camera phones are expected to be two major growth drivers in the coming
years. According to the Shosteck Group, sales of color-display phones will increase from
roughly 85 million units in 2002 to over 350 million units by 2005. Meanwhile, handsets
with built-in cameras are forecasted to increase from 20 million units in 2002 to almost
250 million units by 2005. These new wireless phones will also feature higher data rate
services driven by 2.5G and 3G standards such as GPRS, CDMA 2000, EDGE and WCDMA.
According to EMC, the combination of new subscriber additions and higher replacement rates
is expected to drive total handset sales from 400 million units in 2002 to approximately
544 million units in 2005.

In response to this rapidly growing
market, handset original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, are significantly shortening
product development cycles, seeking simplified architectures and streamlining
manufacturing processes. Traditional OEMs are shifting to low-cost suppliers around the
world. In turn, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, and contract manufacturers, who
lack RF and systems-level expertise, are entering the high-volume mobile phone market to
support OEMs as well as to develop handset platforms of their own. ODMs and contract
manufacturers seek to manage low-cost handset manufacturing and assembly, freeing OEMs to
focus on marketing and distribution aspects of their business. Established handset
manufacturers and new market entrants alike are demanding complete semiconductor system
solutions that include the RF system, all baseband processing, protocol stack and user
interface software, plus comprehensive reference designs and development platforms. With
these solutions, traditional handset OEMs can accelerate time-to-market cycles with lower
investments in engineering and system design. These solutions also enable ODMs to enter
the high volume handset market without requiring significant investments in RF and
systems-level expertise.

Similarly, cellular and personal
communications services network operators are developing and deploying next generation
services. These service providers are incorporating packet-switching capability in their
networks to deliver data communications and Internet access to digital cellular and other
wireless devices. Over the long term, service providers are seeking to establish a global
network that can be accessed by subscribers at any time, anywhere in the world and that
can provide subscribers with multimedia services. To meet this goal, OEMs that supply
wireless infrastructure base stations to network operators are increasingly relying on
mobile communications semiconductor suppliers that can provide highly integrated RF and
mixed signal processing functionality.

Additionally, as service providers
migrate cellular subscribers to data intensive next generation applications, base stations
that transmit and receive signals in the backbone of cellular and personal communications
services systems will be under further capacity constraints. To meet the related demand,
OEMs will be challenged to increase base station transceiver performance and
functionality, while reducing size, power consumption and overall system costs.

We believe that these market trends
create a potentially significant opportunity for a broad-based wireless semiconductor
supplier with a comprehensive product portfolio supported by specialized wireless
manufacturing process technologies and a full range of systems-level expertise.

OUR STRATEGY

Skyworks’ vision is to become
the premier supplier of wireless semiconductor solutions. Key elements in our strategy
include:

Leveraging Core
Technologies

Skyworks deploys technology building
blocks such as radio frequency integrated circuits, analog/mixed-signal processing cores
and digital baseband engines as well as software across multiple product platforms. We
believe that this approach creates economies of scale in research and development and
facilitates a reduction in the time to market for key products.

Increasing Integration
Levels

High levels of integration enhance
the benefits of our products by reducing production costs through the use of fewer
external components, reduced board space and improved system assembly yields. By combining
all of the necessary communications functions for a complete system solution, Skyworks can
deliver additional semiconductor content, thereby offering existing and potential
customers more compelling and cost-effective solutions.

Capturing an Increasing
Amount of Semiconductor Content

We enable our customers to start with
individual components as necessary, and then migrate up the product integration ladder. We
believe that our highly integrated solutions will enable these customers to speed their
time to market while focusing their resources on product differentiation through a broader
range of more sophisticated, next-generation features.

Diversifying Customer
Base

Skyworks supports virtually every
wireless handset OEM including Nokia Corporation, Motorola, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co.,
Sony/Ericsson and LG Electronics, Inc. as well as emerging ODMs and contract manufacturers
such as BenQ, Compal, Flextronics and Quanta. With the industry’s move towards
outsourcing, we believe that we are particularly well-positioned to address the growing
needs of new market entrants who seek RF and system-level integration expertise.

Delivering Operational
Excellence

The Skyworks operations team
leverages world-class manufacturing technologies and enables highly integrated modules as
well as system-level solutions. Skyworks will vertically integrate where it can
differentiate or will otherwise enter alliances and partnerships for leading-edge
capabilities. These partnerships and alliances are designed to ensure product leadership
and competitive advantage in the marketplace. We are focused on achieving the
industry’s shortest cycle times, highest yields and ultimately the lowest cost
structure.

MARKETING AND
DISTRIBUTION

Our products are primarily sold
through a direct Skyworks sales force. This team is globally deployed across all major
market regions. In some markets we supplement our direct sales effort with independent
manufacturers’ representatives, assuring broader coverage of territories and
customers. We also utilize distribution partners, some of which are franchised globally
with others specific to North American markets.

We maintain an internal marketing
organization that is responsible for developing sales and advertising literature, print
media such as product announcements and catalogs, as well as a variety of web-based
content. Skyworks’ sales engagement begins at the earliest stages in a customer
design. We strive to provide close technical collaboration with our customers at the
inception of a new program. This partnership allows our team to facilitate customer-driven
solutions, which leverage the unique strength of our portfolio while providing high value
and greatly reduced time to market.

We believe that the technical and
complex nature of our products and markets demands an extraordinary commitment to close
ongoing relationships with our customers. As such, we strive to expand the scope of our
customer relationship to include design, engineering, manufacturing, purchasing and
project management. We also employ a collaborative approach in developing these
partnerships by combining the support of our design teams, applications engineers,
manufacturing personnel, sales and marketing staff and senior management.

We believe that maintaining frequent
and interactive contact with our customers is paramount to our continuous efforts to
provide world-class sales and service support. By listening and responding to feedback, we
are able to mobilize actions to raise the level of customer satisfaction, improve our
ability to anticipate future product needs, and enhance our understanding of key market
dynamics. We are confident that diligence in following this path will position Skyworks to
participate in numerous opportunities for growth in the future.

CUSTOMERS

During fiscal year 2003, Samsung
Electronics Co. and Motorola, Inc. accounted for 15% and 11%, respectively, of the
Company’s total net revenues. During fiscal year 2002, Samsung Electronics Co. and
Motorola, Inc. accounted for 35% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s total net
revenues. As of September 30, 2003 Samsung Electronics Co. accounted for approximately 18%
of the Company’s gross accounts receivable. The foregoing percentages are based on
sales representing the wireless business of Conexant’s sales for the fiscal year 2002
up to the time of the Merger, and sales of the combined company for the post-Merger period
from June 26, 2002 through the end of the fiscal year and for fiscal 2003.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

We own or are licensed under numerous
United States and foreign patents and patent applications related to our products, our
manufacturing operations and processes and other activities. In addition, we own a number
of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and services. We
believe that intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trade secrets
and trademarks are of material importance to our business. We rely on patent, copyright,
trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, as well as nondisclosure and
confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary
technologies, devices, algorithms and processes.

We cannot guarantee that these
efforts will meaningfully protect our intellectual property, and others may independently
develop substantially equivalent proprietary technologies, devices, algorithms or
processes. In addition to protecting our proprietary technologies and processes, we strive
to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to obtain
cross-licenses of intellectual property from others, to obtain access to intellectual
property we do not possess and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property
claims against us. We believe that our technological position depends primarily on our
ability to develop new innovative products through the technical competence of our
engineering personnel.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

We compete on the basis of time to
market; new product innovation; overall product quality and performance; price; compliance
with industry standards; strategic relationships with customers; and protection of our
intellectual property. Certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can
to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to
devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we
can.

Current and potential competitors
also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among
themselves or with our customers, resellers, suppliers or other third parties. These
relationships may affect our customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is
possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly
acquire significant market share. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to
compete successfully against current and potential competitors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our products and markets are subject
to continued technological advances. Recognizing the importance of such technological
advances, we maintain a high level of research and development activities. We maintain
close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market
demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands. Our design centers are
strategically located around the world to be in close proximity to our customers and to
take advantage of key technical and engineering talent worldwide. We are focusing our
development efforts on new products, design tools and manufacturing processes using our
core technologies.

Our research and development
expenditures for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $151.8 million, $132.6 million and $111.1
million, respectively.

RAW MATERIALS

Raw materials for our products and
manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources. It is our policy not
to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise.
Consequently, there are limited situations where we procure certain components and
services for our products from single or limited sources. We purchase materials and
services against long-term agreements or on individual purchase orders. We do not carry
significant inventories and have a limited number of long-term supply contracts with our
suppliers. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and
components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world.

Under supply agreements entered into
with Conexant and Jazz Semiconductor, we receive wafer fabrication, wafer probe and
certain other services from Jazz Semiconductor. Pursuant to these supply agreements, we
are committed to obtain certain minimum wafer volumes from Jazz Semiconductor. Our
expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are anticipated to be
approximately $39 million and $13 million in fiscal 2004 and 2005, respectively.

BACKLOG

Our sales are made primarily pursuant
to standard purchase orders for delivery of products, with such purchase orders officially
acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions. Due to industry practice,
which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to
shipment with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date is
not a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

Federal, state and local requirements
relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous
wastes, and other activities affecting the environment have had, and will continue to
have, an impact on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with environmental
requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without
material effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial
condition.

We believe that our current
expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with
present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the
resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our
liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. We cannot
assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

CYCLICALITY; SEASONALITY

The semiconductor industry is highly
cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change. Product
obsolescence, price erosion, evolving technical standards, and shortened product life
cycles may contribute to wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. These and other
factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, may cause significant
upturns and downturns in the industry, and in our business. We have experienced periods of
industry downturns characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity,
excess inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. These factors
may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and our operational performance. We
have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business in the past and may
experience cyclical fluctuations in the future.

Sales of our products are subject to
seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in end-user consumer applications,
such as mobile handsets. This generally occurs in the last calendar quarter ending in
December. Sales of semiconductor products and system solutions used in these products
generally increase just prior to this quarter and continue at a higher level through the
end of the calendar year.

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Net revenues by geographic area are
presented based upon the country of destination. Net revenues by geographic area are as
follows (in thousands):

Our revenues by geography do not
necessarily correlate to end handset demand by region. For example, if we sell a power
amplifier module to a customer in South Korea, we record the sale within the South Korea
account although that customer, in turn, may integrate that module into a product sold to
a service provider (its customer) in Africa, China, Europe, the Middle East, the Americas
or within South Korea.

by collective bargaining agreements.  We believe our future success will
depend in large part upon our continued ability to attract, motivate, develop and retain
highly skilled and dedicated employees.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

We own and lease manufacturing
facilities and other real estate properties in the United States and a number of foreign
countries. We own and lease approximately 900,000 square feet and 100,000 square feet,
respectively, of office and manufacturing space. In addition, we lease approximately
430,000 square feet of sales office and design center space with approximately 22% of this
space located in foreign countries. We are headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts and have
executive offices in Irvine, California. The following table sets forth our principal
facilities measuring 50,000 square feet or more:

facilities necessary to operate at present levels.

Certain of our facilities, including
our California and Mexico facilities, are located near major earthquake fault lines. We
maintain no earthquake insurance with respect to these facilities.

ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time various lawsuits,
claims and proceedings have been, and may in the future be, instituted or asserted against
Skyworks, including those pertaining to patent infringement, intellectual property,
environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment and contractual matters.
In addition, in connection with the Merger, Skyworks has assumed responsibility for all
then current and future litigation (including environmental and intellectual property
proceedings) against Conexant or its subsidiaries in respect of the operations of
Conexant’s wireless business. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to
Skyworks. Intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief which, if
imposed against Skyworks, could materially and adversely affect the financial condition or
results of operations of Skyworks.

Additionally, the semiconductor
industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property
rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert
patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that
are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we
license their technology. At the present time, we are in discussions with Qualcomm
Incorporated regarding claims each of us have filed and served against the other in the
United States District Court for Southern District of California asserting violations of
certain of our respective intellectual property rights. The purpose of these discussions
is to arrive at a business resolution that avoids protracted litigation for both parties.
We believe their claims are without merit and if we are not successful resolving this
matter outside of litigation, we are prepared to vigorously defend against their claims
and fully prosecute our claims against them.

Neither Skyworks nor its corporate
predecessor, Alpha, have paid cash dividends on common stock since an Alpha dividend made
in fiscal 1986, and Skyworks does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable
future. Our expectation is to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance future
growth.

RECENT SALES OF
UNREGISTERED SECURITIES

On June 25, 2002, in connection with
the Merger, the Company issued to Jazz Semiconductor, Inc. a warrant to purchase 1,017,900
shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $24.02 per share. This warrant is
exercisable in increments of 25% as of June 25, 2002, March 11, 2003, September 11, 2003
and March 11, 2004. This warrant was issued in reliance upon the exemption from
registration set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities
Act”). The Company did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of this
warrant.

On December 12, 2002, the Company
issued 46,211 shares of its common stock to Skyworks Technologies, Inc (“STI”)
in connection with the settlement of an outstanding complaint filed by STI alleging
trademark infringement, false designation of origin, unfair competition, and false
advertising by the Company. The settlement agreement entered into with STI required that
the Company issue such shares to STI and that STI release of all of its pending claims
against the Company, as well as arranged for mutual coexistence using the name
“Skyworks.” The common stock was issued in reliance upon the exemption from
registration set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The common stock issued in
this transaction has been registered for resale pursuant to an effective registration
statement on Form S-3. The Company did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of
this common stock.

On November 12, 2002, the Company
sold $230 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.75 percent convertible subordinated
notes due November 15, 2007 (the “Junior Notes”), in a private placement
pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, at a purchase price equal to 100 percent
of the principal amount at maturity of the notes, resulting in net proceeds to the Company
of approximately $222.6 million. The initial purchasers, Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, CIBC World Markets Corp. and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc., purchased the
Junior Notes at 97 percent of the issue price and resold them in private resale
transactions to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. The Junior Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any
time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of
$9.0505 per share which is equal to 110.4911 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes,
subject to adjustment. The Junior Notes are subordinated to our existing and future senior
indebtedness (including the Senior Notes discussed below). We may redeem the Junior Notes
at any time after November 20, 2005. The redemption price of the Junior Notes during the
period between November 20, 2005 through November 14, 2006 will be $1,011.875 per $1,000
principal amount of notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
redemption date, and the redemption price of the notes beginning on November 15, 2006 and
thereafter will be $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of notes to be redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Holders may require the
Company to repurchase the Junior Notes upon a change in control of the Company.

The net proceeds from the offering of
Junior Notes were principally used to retire $105 million of a $150 million note issued to
Conexant for the purchase of the Mexicali Operations and to prepay $65 million principal
amount outstanding as of November 13, 2002 under a separate loan facility with Conexant,
dissolving the loan facility. In connection with the prepayment of $105 million of the
$150 million note relating to the purchase of the Mexicali Operations, the remaining $45
million principal balance on this note was exchanged, in a private placement to Conexant
pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, for an equal principal amount of new 15
percent Interim Convertible Notes due June 30, 2005 (the “Interim Notes”) with a
maturity date of June 30, 2005. In addition to the retirement of $170 million in principal
amount of indebtedness owing to Conexant, we also retained approximately $53 million of
net proceeds of the private placement to support our working capital needs.

On November 25, 2002, the Company
issued $45 million aggregate principal amount of 15 percent Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes due June 30, 2005 (the “Senior Notes”) to Conexant, in a
private placement pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, in exchange for an
equal principal amount of Interim Notes which were issued to Conexant in November 2002.
The Senior Notes mature on June 30, 2005, unless earlier converted or redeemed. At
maturity (including upon certain acceleration events), we will pay the principal amount of
the Senior Notes by issuing a number of shares of common stock equal to the principal
amount of the Senior Notes then due and payable divided by the applicable conversion price
in effect on such date, together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The Senior
Notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock, at the
applicable conversion price as of the related conversion date, at any time prior to
maturity at an initial conversion price of $7.87 per share, subject to adjustment for
certain anti-dilution events and as follows: in the event that the market price of our
common stock is below the conversion price for a specified period, the Senior Notes are
convertible into that number of shares of our common stock that is equal to the principal
amount of the Senior Notes being converted divided by the market price of our common
stock, provided that in no event will the number of shares issued exceed 125 percent of
the number of shares that the holders would have received at the initial conversion price.
We may redeem the Senior Notes at any time after May 12, 2004 at $1,030 per $1,000
principal amount of Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders
of the Senior Notes may require us to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a change in
control. The Company did not receive any separate cash proceeds from the issuance of the
Senior Notes.

ITEM 6.     SELECTED
FINANCIAL DATA

You should read the data set forth
below in conjunction with

Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations”

and our

consolidated financial
statements and related notes

appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2003
consisted of 53 weeks and ended on October 3, 2003 and fiscal years 2002 and 2001 each
consisted of 52 weeks and ended on September 27, 2002 and September 28, 2001,
respectively. For convenience, the consolidated financial statements have been shown as
ending on the last day of the calendar month. The following balance sheet data and
statements of operations data for the five years ended September 30, 2003 were derived
from our audited consolidated financial statements. Consolidated balance sheets at
September 30, 2003 and 2002 and the related consolidated statements of operations and of
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2003 and notes
thereto appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Because the Merger was accounted for
as a reverse acquisition, a purchase of Alpha by Washington/Mexicali, the historical
financial statements of Washington/Mexicali became the historical financial statements of
Skyworks after the Merger. The historical information provided below does not include the
historical financial results of Alpha for periods prior to June 25, 2002, the date the
Merger was consummated. The historical financial information may not be indicative of the
Company’s future performance and does not reflect what the results of operations and
financial position prior to the Merger would have been had Washington/Mexicali operated
independently of Conexant during the periods presented prior to the Merger or had the
results of Alpha been combined with those of Washington/Mexicali during the periods
presented prior to the Merger.

The Merger was completed on June 25, 2002. Financial statements for periods
               prior to June 26, 2002 represent Washington/Mexicali’s combined results and
               financial condition. Financial statements for periods after June 26, 2002
               represent the consolidated results and financial condition of Skyworks, the
               combined company.

(2)

In fiscal 2001, the Company recorded $58.7 million of inventory write-downs.

(3)

Amounts in fiscal 2003 primarily reflect amortization of current technology and
               customer relationships acquired in the Merger. Amounts in fiscal 2002, 2001 and
               2000, primarily reflect amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets
               related to the acquisition of Philsar Semiconductor Inc. in fiscal 2000.

(4)

In fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2000, the Company recorded purchased in-process
               research and development charges of $65.5 million and $24.4 million,
               respectively, related to the Merger and the acquisition of Philsar Semiconductor
               Inc., respectively.

(5)

In fiscal 2003, the Company recorded special charges of $34.5 million,
               principally related to the impairment of assets related to the Company’s
               infrastructure products and certain restructuring charges. In fiscal 2002, the
               Company recorded special charges of $116.3 million, principally related to the
               impairment of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and the related
               facility in Mexicali, Mexico, and the write-off of goodwill and other intangible
               assets related to Philsar Semiconductor Inc. In fiscal 2001, the Company
               recorded special charges of $88.9 million, principally related to the impairment
               of certain wafer fabrication assets and restructuring activities.

(6)

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
               “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” on October 1, 2002. As a
               result of this adoption, the Company performed a transitional evaluation of its
               goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Based on this transitional
               evaluation, the Company determined that its goodwill was impaired and recorded a
               $397.1 million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal
               2003.

(7)

Prior to the Merger with Alpha Industries, Inc., Washington/Mexicali had no
               separate capitalization. Therefore, a calculation cannot be performed for
               weighted average shares outstanding to then calculate earnings per share.

ITEM 7.    
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In addition to historical
information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject
to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to
herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risk factors, risks and
cautionary statements described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW

Skyworks Solutions, Inc.
(“Skyworks” or the “Company”) is a leading wireless semiconductor
company focused exclusively on radio frequency (“RF”) and complete cellular
system solutions for mobile communications applications. We offer front-end modules, RF
subsystems and cellular systems to leading wireless handset and infrastructure customers.

On June 25, 2002, pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of December 16, 2001, as amended as of
April 12, 2002, by and among Alpha Industries, Inc. (“Alpha”), Conexant Systems,
Inc. (“Conexant”) and Washington Sub, Inc. (“Washington”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Conexant to which Conexant spun off its wireless communications
business, including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility located in Newbury
Park, California, but excluding certain assets and liabilities, Washington merged with and
into Alpha with Alpha as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). Following the
Merger, Alpha changed its corporate name to Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

Immediately following completion of
the Merger, the Company purchased Conexant’s semiconductor assembly, module
manufacturing and test facility located in Mexicali, Mexico, and certain related
operations (“Mexicali Operations”) for $150 million. For financial accounting
purposes, the sale of the Mexicali Operations by Conexant to Skyworks Solutions was
treated as if Conexant had contributed the Mexicali Operations to Washington as part of
the spin-off, and the $150 million purchase price was treated as a return of capital to
Conexant. For purposes of these financial statements, the Washington business and the
Mexicali Operations are collectively referred to as Washington/Mexicali. References to the
“Company” refer to Washington/Mexicali for all periods prior to June 26, 2002,
and to the combined company following the Merger.

The Merger was accounted for as a
reverse acquisition whereby Washington was treated as the acquirer and Alpha as the
acquiree, primarily because Conexant shareholders owned a majority, approximately 67
percent, of the Company upon completion of the Merger. Under a reverse acquisition, the
purchase price of Alpha was based upon the fair market value of Alpha common stock for a
reasonable period of time before and after the announcement date of the Merger and the
fair value of Alpha stock options. The purchase price of Alpha was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed by Washington, as the acquiring company for accounting
purposes, based upon their estimated fair market value at the acquisition date. Because
the historical financial statements of the Company after the Merger do not include the
historical financial results of Alpha for periods prior to June 25, 2002, the financial
statements may not be indicative of future results of operations and are not indicative of
the historical results that would have resulted if the Merger had occurred at the
beginning of a historical financial period.

We entered into agreements with
Conexant providing for the supply to us of transition services by Conexant and for the
supply of gallium arsenide wafer fabrication and assembly and test services to Conexant,
initially at substantially the same volumes as historically obtained by Conexant from
Washington/Mexicali. We also entered into agreements with Conexant and Jazz Semiconductor,
Inc., a Newport Beach, California foundry joint venture between Conexant and the Carlyle
Group (“Jazz Semiconductor”), providing for the supply to us of silicon-based
wafer fabrication, wafer probe and certain other services by Jazz Semiconductor.
Historically, Washington/Mexicali obtained a portion of its silicon-based semiconductors
from the Newport Beach wafer fabrication facility that is now Jazz Semiconductor. We also
provide semiconductor assembly and test services to Conexant at our Mexicali facility.

The wireless communications
semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid
technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards,
short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our
operating results have been, and our operating results may continue to be, negatively
affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a
number of factors, such as changes in demand for end-user equipment, the timing of the
receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders, the gain or loss of
significant customers, market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products,
our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely
basis, availability and cost of products from suppliers, new product and technology
introductions by competitors, changes in the mix of products produced and sold,
intellectual property disputes, the timing and extent of product development costs and
general economic conditions. In the past, average selling prices of established products
have generally declined over time and this trend is expected to continue in the future.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The financial statements prior to the
Merger were prepared using Conexant’s historical basis in the assets and liabilities
and the historical operating results of Washington/Mexicali during each respective period.
We believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable. However,
the financial information included herein and in our consolidated financial statements may
not be indicative of the combined assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of
the Company in the future and is not indicative of what they would have been had
Washington/Mexicali been a separate stand-alone entity and independent of Conexant during
the historical periods presented.

Our fiscal year ends on the Friday
closest to September 30. Fiscal 2003 consisted of 53 weeks and ended on October 3, 2003
and fiscal years 2002 and 2001 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on September 27, 2002
and September 28, 2001, respectively. For convenience, the consolidated financial
statements have been shown as ending on the last day of the calendar month. Accordingly,
references to September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 contained in this discussion refer to our
actual fiscal year-end.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon
historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the
extent actual results differ from those estimates, our future results of operations may be
affected. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements.

Allowance for doubtful
accounts

— We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial
condition of our customers were to deteriorate, our actual losses may exceed our
estimates, and additional allowances would be required.

Inventories

— We assess
the recoverability of inventories through an on-going review of inventory levels relative
to sales backlog and forecasts, product marketing plans and product life cycles. When the
inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand (generally in excess of six months), we
write down the value of those excess inventories. We sell our products to communications
equipment original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that have designed our
products into equipment such as cellular handsets. These design wins are gained through a
lengthy sales cycle, which includes providing technical support to the OEM customer. In
the event of the loss of business from existing OEM customers, we may be unable to secure
new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins.
Consequently, when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed forecasted demand from
existing OEM customers into whose products our products have been designed, we generally
will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others, and the net realizable value of
such inventories is generally estimated to be zero. The amount of the write-down is the
excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value (generally zero). Once
established, these write-downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of
the excess inventory. Demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time, and
actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by
management. In the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected, additional
inventory write-downs may be required.

Valuation of long-lived assets,
goodwill and intangible assets

— Carrying values for long-lived assets and
definitive-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for possible
impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” which was adopted on October 1, 2002. Impairment reviews are
conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable. The
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition. The estimate of
cash flows is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future
operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual
cash flows due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes
to our business model or changes in our operating performance. If the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value, we recognize
an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair
value of the asset. Fair value is determined using discounted cash flows.

Carrying values of goodwill and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for possible impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which was
adopted on October 1, 2002. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The first
step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value. In
determining fair value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of several valuation
methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair
value. Step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its
carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price allocation. If the carrying amount
of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that
excess. We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth
fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying
value of goodwill may be impaired.

Deferred income taxes

—
We have provided a valuation allowance related to our substantial United States deferred
tax assets. If sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable
income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent, we may be required to reduce our
valuation allowance, which may result in income tax benefits in our statement of
operations. The future realization of certain tax deferred assets will be applied to
reduce the carrying value of goodwill. The portion of the valuation allowance for these
deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits may be applied to
reduce goodwill related to the purchase consideration of the Merger is approximately $44
million. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for
a valuation allowance quarterly. In fiscal 2002, we recorded a tax benefit of
approximately $23 million related to the impairment of our Mexicali assets. A valuation
allowance has not been established because we believe that the related deferred tax asset
will be recovered during the carryforward period.

Revenue recognition

—

Revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title, in
accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer. Revenue
recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete. Certain
product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for
price protection and/or a right of return on unsold products. We reduce revenue to the
extent of our estimate for distributor claims of price protection and/or right of return
on unsold product. A reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded
based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a
reserve.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GENERAL

Net revenues increased $160.0
million, or 35%, in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 primarily as the result of
increasing demand for our wireless product portfolio and the exclusion of Alpha’s
revenues for periods prior to the Merger. Since the Merger, we have also expanded our
customer base and geographical market presence resulting in higher revenues in fiscal
2003. Gross margin improved in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 reflecting
increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities. In fiscal
2003, we recorded special charges of $34.5 million, principally related to the impairment
of assets related to our infrastructure products and certain restructuring charges.

We adopted SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” October 1, 2002 and performed a
transitional impairment test for goodwill. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step
process. The first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book
value. In determining fair value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of several valuation
methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair
value. As part of the first step, we determined that we have one reporting unit for
purposes of performing the fair-value based test of goodwill. This reporting unit is
consistent with our single operating segment, which management determined is appropriate
under the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information.” We completed step one and determined that our goodwill and
unamortized intangible assets were impaired. Step two of the analysis compares the implied
fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price
allocation. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an
impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. We completed step two and determined
that the carrying amount of our goodwill was $397.1 million greater than its implied fair
value. This transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle in fiscal 2003. In addition, we completed our annual goodwill
impairment test for fiscal 2003 and determined that as of July 1, 2003, our goodwill was
not further impaired.

We market and sell our semiconductor
products and system solutions to leading OEMs of communication electronics products,
third-party original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) and contract manufacturers
and indirectly through electronic components distributors. Samsung Electronics Co.
accounted for 15%, 35%, and 44% of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Motorola, Inc. accounted for 11% of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003
and 2002, and represented less than 10% of net revenues for fiscal 2001. Conexant
accounted for less than 10% of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and
represented 17% of net revenues for fiscal 2001. Nokia Corporation accounted for less than
10% of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and represented 12% of net revenues
for fiscal 2001.

Revenues derived from customers
located in the Americas region accounted for 25%, 17% and 27% of net revenues for the
fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues derived from customers located in
the Asia-Pacific region were 61%, 77% and 64% of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues derived from customers located in the Europe/Middle
East/Africa region were 14%, 6% and 9% of net revenues for the fiscal years 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Our revenues by geography do not necessarily correlate to end handset
demand by region. For example, if we sell a power amplifier module to a customer in South
Korea, we record the sale within the South Korea account although that customer, in turn,
may integrate that module into a product sold to a service provider (its customer) in
Africa, China, Europe, the Middle East, the Americas or within South Korea.

The foregoing percentages are based
on sales representing Washington/Mexicali sales for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 up to the
time of the Merger, and sales of the combined company for the post-Merger period from June
26, 2002 through the end of the fiscal year and for fiscal 2003.

Net revenues increased in fiscal 2003
when compared to fiscal 2002 primarily reflecting increasing demand for our wireless
product portfolio and the exclusion of Alpha’s revenues for periods prior to the
Merger. More specifically, GSM direct conversion transceivers and complete cellular
systems as well as CDMA RF subsystems exhibited strong year-over-year growth.
Additionally, we have launched a number of more highly integrated product offerings, added
to our customer base and expanded our geographical market presence.

These increases in net revenues in
fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 were tempered by a decrease in average selling
prices of our front-end module products and an industry-wide component and handset
inventory correction. In addition, lower CDMA handset subsidies in Korea also adversely
affected net revenues in fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002. In certain global
markets, wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers,
ultimately decreasing the cost of the handset to the customer.

Net revenues increased 75.8% in
fiscal 2002, when compared to fiscal 2001, principally reflecting increased sales of GSM
products, including power amplifier modules and complete cellular systems. We also
experienced increased demand for our power amplifier modules for CDMA and TDMA
applications from a number of our key customers.

Gross margin represents net revenues
less cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials,
labor and overhead (including depreciation) associated with product manufacturing, royalty
and other intellectual property costs and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to
products sold. Cost of goods sold for the periods prior to the Merger also includes
allocations from Conexant of manufacturing cost variances, process engineering and other
manufacturing costs, which are not included in our unit costs but are expensed as
incurred.

The improvement in gross margin in
fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 reflects increased revenues, improved utilization of
our manufacturing facilities and a decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from the
write-down of our Mexicali facility assets in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Although
recent revenue growth has increased the level of utilization of our manufacturing
facilities, these facilities continue to operate below optimal capacity and
underutilization continues to adversely affect our unit cost of goods sold and gross
margin.

Gross margin in fiscal 2003 was also
favorably affected by $4.8 million when we reevaluated our obligation under a wafer
fabrication supply agreement with Conexant and Jazz Semiconductor and reduced our
liability and cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Pursuant to the terms of
wafer supply agreements with Conexant and Jazz Semiconductor, we are committed to obtain
certain minimum wafer volumes from Jazz Semiconductor. As of September 30, 2003, we expect
to meet all of these purchase obligations. Our costs will be affected by the extent of our
use of outside foundries and the pricing we are able to obtain. During periods of high
industry demand for wafer fabrication capacity, we may have to pay higher prices to secure
wafer fabrication capacity.

The improvement in gross margin in
fiscal 2002, compared to fiscal 2001, reflects increased revenues, improved utilization of
our manufacturing facilities and a decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from the
write-down of the Newbury Park wafer fabrication assets in the third quarter of fiscal
2001 and the Mexicali facility assets in the third quarter of 2002. The effect of the
write-down of the Newbury Park wafer fabrication assets and the Mexicali facility assets
on fiscal 2002 gross margin was approximately $10.5 million and $5.5 million,
respectively. Gross margin for fiscal 2002 was adversely impacted by additional warranty
costs of $14.0 million. The additional warranty costs were the result of an agreement with
a major customer for the reimbursement of costs the customer incurred in connection with
the failure of a product when used in a certain adverse environment. Although we developed
and sold the product to the customer pursuant to mutually agreed-upon specifications, the
product experienced unusual failures when used in an environment in which the product had
not been previously tested. The product has since been modified and no significant
additional costs are expected to be incurred in connection with this issue.

In addition, we originally estimated
our obligation under our wafer supply agreement with Conexant and Jazz Semiconductor, Inc.
would result in excess costs of approximately $12.9 million when recorded as a liability
and charged to cost of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2002, we reevaluated this obligation and reduced our liability and cost
of sales by approximately $8.1 million in the quarter.

Gross margin for the year ended
September 30, 2002 benefited by approximately $12.5 million as a result of the sale of
inventories having a historical cost of $12.5 million that were written down to a zero
cost basis during fiscal year 2001; such sales resulted from sharply increased demand
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 that was not anticipated at the time of the
write-downs. Gross margin for fiscal 2001 was adversely affected by inventory write-downs
of approximately $58.7 million, partially offset by approximately $4.5 million of
subsequent sales of inventories written down to a zero cost basis. The inventories that
were written down to a zero cost basis in fiscal 2001 were either sold or scrapped during
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. During fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, we sold $2.7 million, $12.5
million and $4.5 million, respectively, and scrapped $2.7 million, $1.8 million and $34.5
million, respectively. As of September 30, 2003, we no longer held inventories which were
written down to a zero cost basis in fiscal 2001.

The inventory write-downs recorded in
fiscal 2001 resulted from the sharply reduced end-customer demand we experienced,
primarily associated with our RF components, as a result of the rapidly changing demand
environment for digital cellular handsets during that period. As a result of these market
conditions, we experienced a significant number of order cancellations and a decline in
the volume of new orders, beginning in the fiscal 2001 first quarter and becoming more
pronounced in the second quarter.

Research and development expenses
consist principally of direct personnel costs, costs for pre-production evaluation and

for the periods prior to the Merger also include allocated costs for shared research and
development services provided by Conexant, principally in the areas of advanced
semiconductor process development, design automation and advanced package development, for
the benefit of several of Conexant’s businesses.

The increase in research and
development expenses in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 represents our commitment to
design new products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our
customers’ demands. We have expanded customer support engagements as well as
development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the CDMA2000, GSM, General
Packet Radio Services, or GPRS, and third-generation, or 3G, wireless standards in both
the digital cellular handset and infrastructure markets. The increase in research and
development expenses in fiscal 2003 when compared to the previous year is also related to
our research and development expenses representing those of the combined company after the
Merger whereas those expenses in 2002 are representative of only Washington/Mexicali prior
to June 25, 2002.

The increase in research and
development expenses in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily reflects the opening
of a new design center in Le Mans, France and higher headcount and personnel-related
costs. Subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we expanded customer support
engagements as well as development efforts targeting semiconductor solutions using the
CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS, and 3G wireless standards in both the digital cellular handset and

The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 primarily reflects lower
headcount and personnel-related costs resulting from the expense reduction and
restructuring actions initiated during fiscal 2001 and lower provisions for uncollectible
accounts receivable.

In 2002, we recorded $36.4 million of
intangible assets related to the Merger consisting of developed technology, customer
relationships and a trademark. These assets are principally being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a 10-year period. Amortization expense for fiscal 2003 primarily
represents the amortization of these intangible assets. Amortization expense for fiscal
2002 and 2001 primarily represents amortization of goodwill and intangible assets acquired
in connection with Washington/Mexicali’s acquisition of Philsar Semiconductor, Inc.
(“Philsar”) in fiscal 2000. Philsar was a developer of RF semiconductor
solutions for personal wireless connectivity, including emerging standards such as
Bluetooth, and RF components for third-generation digital cellular handsets. We wrote off
all goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisition of the Philsar
Bluetooth business in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. The lower amortization expense in
fiscal 2003 when compared to fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, primarily resulted from the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” on October 1, 2002. Had the Company
ceased amortizing goodwill on October 1, 2000, amortization expense would have been $10.7
million and $13.9 million less in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, respectively.

We adopted SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” on October 1, 2002 and performed a
transitional impairment test for goodwill. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step
process. The first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book
value. In determining fair value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of several valuation
methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair
value. As part of the first step, we determined that we have one reporting unit for
purposes of performing the fair-value based test of goodwill. This reporting unit is
consistent with our single operating segment, which management determined is appropriate
under the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information.” We completed step one and determined that our goodwill and
unamortized intangible assets were impaired. Step two of the analysis compares the implied
fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to purchase price
allocation. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an
impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. We completed step two and determined
that the carrying amount of our goodwill was $397.1 million greater than its implied fair
value. This transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle in fiscal 2003. In addition, we completed our annual goodwill
impairment test for fiscal 2003 and determined that as of July 1, 2003, our goodwill was
not further impaired.

In connection with the Merger in
fiscal 2002, $65.5 million was allocated to purchased in-process research and development
(“IPR&D”) and expensed immediately upon completion of the acquisition (as a
charge not deductible for tax purposes) because the technological feasibility of certain
products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses
existed. The charges represent the estimated fair values of the portion of IPR&D
projects that had been completed by Alpha at the time of the Merger.

Prior to the Merger, Alpha was in the
process of developing new technologies in its semiconductor and ceramics segments. The
objective of the IPR&D effort was to develop new semiconductor processes, ceramic
materials and related products to satisfy customer requirements in the wireless and
broadband markets.

The
semiconductor segment was involved in several projects that have been aggregated into the following categories
based on the respective technologies:

Power Amplifier:

Power amplifiers are designed and manufactured for use in
different types of wireless handsets. The main performance attributes of these amplifiers are efficiency, power
output, operating voltage and distortion. Current research and development is focused on expanding the offering
to all types of wireless standards, improving performance by process and circuit improvements and offering a
higher level of integration.

Control Products:

Control products consist of switches and switch filters that are
used in wireless applications for signal routing. Most applications are in the handset market enabling
multi-mode, multi-band handsets. Current research and development is focused on performance improvement and
cost reduction by reducing chip size and increasing functionality.

Broadband:

The products in this grouping
consist of radio frequency (RF) and millimeter wave semiconductors and components designed and manufactured
specifically to address the needs of high-speed, wireline and wireless network access. Current and long-term
research and development is focused on performance enhancement of speed and bandwidth as well as cost reduction
and integration.

Silicon Diode:

These products use silicon processes to fabricate diodes for use in a variety of
RF and wireless applications. Current research and development is focused on reducing the size of the device,
improving performance and reducing cost.

Ceramics:

The ceramics segment was involved in projects that relate to
the design and manufacture of ceramic-based components such as resonators and filters for the wireless
infrastructure market. Current research and development is focused on performance enhancements through improved
formulations and electronic designs.

The material risks associated with
the successful completion of the in-process technology were associated with our ability to
successfully finish the creation of viable prototypes and successful design of the chips,
masks and manufacturing processes required. We expected to benefit from the in-process
projects as the individual products that contained the in-process technology were put into
production and sold to end-users. The release dates for each of the products within the
product families were varied. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the
income approach. Under the income approach, the fair value reflected the present value of
the projected cash flows that were expected to be generated by the products incorporating
the IPR&D, if successful. The projected cash flows were discounted to approximate fair
value. The discount rate applicable to the cash flows of each project reflected the stage
of completion and other risks inherent in each project. The weighted average discount rate
used in the valuation of IPR&D was 30 percent. As of September 30, 2003, the Company had either completed or abandoned each of these projects.
 The completed IPR&D projects commenced
generating cash flows in fiscal 2003.  Due to the nature of these projects and the related technolgy, the revenue streams derived from these projects cannot be separately identified.

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003, we recorded a $26.0 million charge for the impairment of assets related to certain
infrastructure products manufactured in our Woburn, Massachusetts and Adamstown, Maryland
facilities. The Woburn facility primarily manufactures semiconductor products based on
both silicon wafer technology and gallium arsenide technology. Our Adamstown, Maryland
facility primarily manufactures ceramics components. We experienced a significant decline
in factory utilization resulting from a downturn in the market for products manufactured
at these two facilities and a decision to discontinue certain products. The impairment
charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by management based on these
factors and the related impact on our current and projected outlook. We projected lower
revenues and new order volume for these products and management believed these factors
indicated that the carrying value of the related assets (machinery, equipment and
intangible assets) may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be
performed. In performing the analysis for recoverability, management estimated the future
cash flows expected to result from these products over a five-year period. Since the
estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets,
it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized. In accordance with SFAS No.
144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the
impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related
assets to their carrying value. The fair value of the assets was determined by computing
the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 16%, which
management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the
projected future cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used in the discounted
cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets. The
write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets. The anticipated pre-tax
cost savings related to these impairment charges is expected to be $17.4 million over the
next five years (fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008) and $8.6 million over the subsequent
fifteen years (fiscal 2009 through 2023).

In addition, during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a $2.3 million charge for the impairment of our
Haverhill, Massachusetts property that is currently being held for sale. In fiscal 2003,
we relocated our operations from this facility to our Woburn, Massachusetts facility. We
are actively marketing the property located in Haverhill, Massachusetts.

During fiscal 2002, the Company
recorded a $66.0 million charge for the impairment of the assembly and test machinery and
equipment and related facility in Mexicali, Mexico. The impairment charge was based on a
recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of a significant downturn in
the market for test and assembly services for non-wireless products and the related impact
on our current and projected outlook.

We experienced a severe decline in
factory utilization at our Mexicali facility for non-wireless products and projected
decreasing revenues and new order volume. Management believed these factors indicated that
the carrying value of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and related facility
may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be performed. In performing
the analysis for recoverability, management estimated the future cash flows expected to
result from the manufacturing activities at the Mexicali facility over a ten-year period.
The estimated future cash flows were based on a gradual phase-out of services sold to
Conexant and modest volume increases consistent with management’s view of the outlook
for the business, partially offset by declining average selling prices. The declines in
average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and management’s
decision to reduce capital expenditures for future capacity expansion. Since the estimated
undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value (approximately $100 million
based on historical cost) of the related assets, it was concluded that an impairment loss
should be recognized. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair
value of the related assets to their carrying value. The fair value of the assets was
determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a
discount rate of 24%, which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks
associated with the projected future cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used
in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of
the assets. The write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets.

During fiscal 2002, we recorded a
$45.8 million charge for the write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets associated
with our acquisition of Philsar in fiscal 2000. Management determined that we would not
support the technology associated with the Philsar Bluetooth business. Accordingly, this
product line was discontinued and the employees associated with the product line were
either severed or relocated to other operations. As a result of the actions taken,
management determined that the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets associated
with the Philsar acquisition were impaired.

During the third quarter of fiscal
2001 we recorded an $86.2 million charge for the impairment of our manufacturing facility
and related wafer fabrication machinery and equipment at our Newbury Park, California
facility. This impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by
management as a result of the dramatic downturn in the market for wireless communications
products and the related impact on our then-current and projected business outlook.
Through the third quarter of fiscal 2001, we experienced a severe decline in factory
utilization at the Newbury Park wafer fabrication facility and decreasing revenues,
backlog, and new order volume. Management believed these factors, together with its
decision to significantly reduce future capital expenditures for advanced process
technologies and capacity beyond the then-current levels, indicated that the value of the
Newbury Park facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be
performed. In performing the analysis for recoverability, management estimated the future
cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the Newbury Park
facility over a ten-year period. The estimated future cash flows were based on modest
volume increases consistent with management’s view of the outlook for the industry,
partially offset by declining average selling prices. The declines in average selling
prices were consistent with historical trends and management’s decision to focus on
existing products based on the current technology. Since the estimated undiscounted cash
flows were less than the carrying value (approximately $106 million based on historical
cost) of the related assets, it was concluded that an impairment loss should be
recognized. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of
the related assets to their carrying value. The fair value of the assets was determined by
computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of
30%, which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with
the projected cash flows. We believe the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow
model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets. The write-down
established a new cost basis for the impaired assets.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

During the second and fourth quarters
of fiscal 2003, we recorded $3.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in restructuring
charges to provide for workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities. The
charges were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for affected employees
and lease cancellation, facility sales, and other costs related to the consolidation of
facilities. Substantially all amounts accrued for these actions are expected to be paid
within one year.

During fiscal 2002, we implemented a
number of cost reduction initiatives to more closely align our cost structure with the
then-current business environment. We recorded restructuring charges of approximately $3.0
million for costs related to the workforce reduction and the consolidation of certain
facilities. Substantially all amounts accrued for these actions have been paid.

During fiscal 2001,
Washington/Mexicali reduced its workforce by approximately 250 employees, including
approximately 230 employees in manufacturing operations. Restructuring charges of $2.7
million were recorded for such actions and were based upon estimates of the cost of
severance benefits for the affected employees. We have paid all amounts accrued for these
actions.

interest,  if any, to the redemption  date, and the redemption price of the notes beginning on November 15, 2006 and thereafter
will be $1,000  per  $1,000  principal  amount of notes to be  redeemed,  plus  accrued  and unpaid  interest,  if any,  to the
redemption  date.  Holders may require that we  repurchase  the Junior  notes upon a change in control of the  Company.  We pay
interest in cash semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year.

In addition,  our long-term debt includes $45 million of convertible  senior  subordinated  notes at a fixed rate of 15 percent
due June 30, 2005,  which were issued as part of our debt  refinancing  with  Conexant  completed  on November 13, 2002.  These
Senior notes can be converted into our common stock at a conversion  rate based on the applicable  conversion  price,  which is
subject  to  adjustment  based on,  among  other  things,  the  market  price of our  common  stock.  Based on this  adjustable
conversion  price,  we expect that the maximum  number of shares that could be issued under the Senior  notes is  approximately
7.1 million shares,  subject to adjustment for stock splits and other similar dilutive  occurrences.  If the holder(s) of these
Senior  notes  converted  the notes at a price  that is less than the  original  conversion  price  ($7.87)  as the result of a
decrease  in the market  price of our  stock,  we would be  required  to record a charge to  interest  expense in the period of
conversion.  At maturity (including upon certain acceleration  events), we will pay the principal amount of the Senior notes by
issuing a number of shares of common stock equal to the  principal  amount of the Senior notes then due and payable  divided by
the applicable  conversion  price in effect on such date,  together with cash in lieu of any fractional  shares.  We may redeem
the Senior notes at any time after May 12, 2004 at $1,030 per $1,000  principal  amount of Senior  notes to be  redeemed,  plus
accrued and unpaid  interest.  The holder(s)  may require that we  repurchase  the Senior notes upon a change in control of the
Company.  We pay interest in cash on the Senior notes on the last business day of each March,  June,  September and December of
each year. Interest on the Senior notes is not deductible for tax purposes because of the conversion feature.

We entered into a receivables  purchase  agreement under which we have agreed to sell from time to time certain of our accounts
receivable to Skyworks USA, Inc.  (“Skyworks  USA”), a  wholly-owned,  special  purpose entity that is fully  consolidated  for
accounting purposes.  Concurrently,  Skyworks USA entered into an agreement with Wachovia Bank, National Association  providing
for a $50 million credit facility (“Facility  Agreement”)  secured by the purchased accounts  receivable.  Our short-term debt
consists primarily of funds borrowed under the Facility  Agreement.  As a part of the  consolidation,  any interest incurred by
Skyworks  USA related to monies it borrows  under the  Facility  Agreement  is  recorded as interest  expense in our results of
operations.  Interest related to the Facility  Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.4% and was  approximately  1.5% at September 30, 2003.
We perform  collections  and  administrative  functions on behalf of Skyworks USA. As of September  30, 2003,  Skyworks USA had
borrowed $41.7 million under this agreement.

In addition,  our short-term debt includes the remaining  portion of a ten-year  $960,000 loan from the State of Maryland under
the Community Development Block Grant program due December 2003 at an interest rate of 5 percent.

As a result of our history of operating losses and the expectation of future operating  results,  we determined that it is more
likely than not that historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized  except for certain  future  deductions
associated with our foreign operations.  Consequently,  no United States income tax benefit has been recognized relating to the
U.S.  operating  losses.  As of September  30, 2003,  we have  established  a valuation  allowance  against all of our net U.S.
deferred tax assets.  Deferred tax assets have been recognized for foreign  operations  when  management  believes they will be
recovered during the carry forward period.

The provision  (benefit) for income taxes for fiscal 2003,  2002 and 2001 consists of foreign  income taxes incurred by foreign
operations.  We do not expect to recognize any income tax benefits  relating to future operating losses generated in the United
States until  management  determines  that such  benefits are more likely than not to be realized.  In 2002,  the provision for
foreign  income  taxes was offset by a tax benefit of  approximately  $23 million  related to the  impairment  of our  Mexicali
assets.

No provision has been made for United States,  state, or additional  foreign income taxes related to approximately $3.8 million
of  undistributed  earnings of foreign  subsidiaries  which have been or are intended to be permanently  reinvested.  It is not
practical to determine the United States  federal  income tax  liability,  if any, which would be payable if such earnings were
not permanently reinvested.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

We adopted SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets," on October 1, 2002, and performed a transitional  impairment
test for goodwill.  The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process.  The first step of the impairment analysis compares our
fair  value  to our net book  value.  In  determining  fair  value,  SFAS  No.  142  allows  for the use of  several  valuation
methodologies,  although it states  quoted  market  prices are the best  evidence of fair value.  As part of the first step, we
determined  that we have one reporting unit for purposes of performing the  fair-value  based test of goodwill.  This reporting
unit is consistent with our single operating segment,  which management  determined is appropriate under the provisions of SFAS
No. 131,  "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related  Information." We completed step one and determined that our
goodwill  and  unamortized  intangible  assets were  impaired.  Step two of the  analysis  compares  the implied  fair value of
goodwill to its carrying  amount.  If the carrying  amount of goodwill  exceeds its implied fair value,  an impairment  loss is
recognized  equal to that excess.  We completed  step two and  determined  that the carrying  amount of our goodwill was $397.1
million  greater than its implied fair value.  This  transitional  impairment  charge was recorded as a cumulative  effect of a
change in accounting  principle in fiscal 2003. In addition,  we completed our annual goodwill  impairment test for fiscal 2003
and determined that as of July 1, 2003, our goodwill was not further impaired.

Cash and cash equivalents at
September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled $161.5 million, $53.4 million and $2.0 million,
respectively. Working capital at September 30, 2003 was approximately $249.3 million
compared to $79.8 million at September 30, 2002 and $60.5 million at September 30, 2001.
Inventory turns were approximately 6.5 for fiscal 2003.

Cash used in operating activities was
$72.1 million for fiscal 2003, reflecting a net loss of $451.4 million, offset by non-cash
charges (primarily asset impairments, depreciation and amortization) of $489.2 million and
a net decrease in working capital items of approximately $109.9 million, including $40.0
million of merger-related expense payments. As of September 30, 2003, substantially all
amounts accrued for merger-related expenses have been paid. We adopted SFAS No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” on October 1, 2002 and recorded a $397.1
million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, representing the difference
between the implied fair value and carrying value of our goodwill. Operating results in
fiscal 2003 improved when compared to fiscal 2002, primarily as the result of increased
revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities.

Cash used in investing activities for
fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of capital expenditures of $40.3 million. The capital
expenditures for fiscal 2003 represent our continued investment in production and test
facilities in addition to our commitment to invest in the capital needed to design new
products and processes and address new opportunities to meet our customers’ demands.
We believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our
current manufacturing capabilities. We may also consider acquisition opportunities to
extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings.
Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2003 also included $4.0 million of purchases
of short-term investments. Our short-term investments are classified as held-to-maturity
and consist primarily of commercial paper with original maturities of more than 90 days
and less than twelve months.

On August 11, 2003 we filed a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC with respect to the issuance of up to $250
million aggregate principal amount of securities, including debt securities, common or
preferred shares, warrants or any combination thereof. This registration statement, which
the SEC declared effective on August 28, 2003, provides us with greater flexibility and
access to capital. On September 9, 2003 we issued 9.2 million shares of common stock under
our shelf registration statement. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2003
included approximately $102.2 million of net proceeds from this offering. We may from time
to time issue securities under the remaining balance of the shelf registration statement
for general corporate purposes.

Cash provided by financing activities
for fiscal 2003 also included the net impact of our private placement of $230 million of
4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007 and related debt refinancing with
Conexant on November 13, 2002. These subordinated notes can be converted into 110.4911
shares of common stock per $1,000 principal balance, which is the equivalent of a
conversion price of approximately $9.05 per share. The net proceeds from the note offering
were principally used to prepay $105 million of the $150 million debt to Conexant relating
to the purchase of the Mexicali Operations and prepay the $65 million principal amount
outstanding as of November 13, 2002 under a separate loan facility with Conexant. In
connection with our prepayment of $105 million of the $150 million debt owed to Conexant
relating to the purchase of the Mexicali Operations, the remaining $45 million principal
balance was exchanged for new 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes with a
maturity date of June 30, 2005. These senior subordinated notes can be converted into our
common stock at a conversion rate based on the applicable conversion price, which is
subject to adjustment based on, among other things, the market price of our common stock.
Based on this adjustable conversion price, we expect that the maximum number of shares
that could be issued under the senior subordinated notes is approximately 7.1 million
shares, subject to adjustment for stock splits and other similar dilutive occurrences. In
addition to the retirement of $170 million in principal amount of indebtedness owing to
Conexant, we also retained approximately $53 million of net proceeds of the private
placement to support our working capital needs. In addition, as of September 30, 2003,
Skyworks USA had borrowed $41.7 million under our $50 million Facility Agreement secured
by the purchased accounts receivable with Wachovia Bank, National Association.

Cash used in operating activities was
$99.1 million and $89.4 million for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Operating cash
flows for fiscal 2002 and 2001 reflect net losses of $236.1 million and $318.9 million,
respectively, offset by non-cash charges (depreciation and amortization, asset impairments
and an in-process research and development charge) of $221.6 million and $220.8 million,
respectively, and a net increase in working capital of approximately $84.6 million and a
net decrease of $8.7 million, respectively. During 2002 we consolidated facilities,
reduced our work force and continued to implement cost saving initiatives. In addition,
increased revenues and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities contributed to
improved operating results in fiscal 2002 when compared to fiscal 2001.

Cash provided by investing activities
for fiscal 2002 consisted of capital expenditures of $29.4 million and dividends to
Conexant of $3.1 million offset by cash received of $67.1 million as a result of the
Merger and $35.4 million from the sale of short-term investments acquired in the Merger.
Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2001 consisted of capital expenditures of
$51.1 million. The capital expenditures for fiscal 2002 reflect a significant reduction
from annual capital expenditures in fiscal 2001, a key component of the cost reduction
initiatives implemented in fiscal 2002.

Cash provided by financing activities
consisted of net transfers from Conexant, pre-Merger, of $50.4 million and $138.3 million
for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal
2002 also consisted of $30.0 million of proceeds from borrowings against the revolving
credit facility with Conexant. Historically, Conexant managed cash on a centralized basis.
Cash receipts associated with Washington/Mexicali’s business were generally collected
by Conexant, and Conexant generally made disbursements on behalf of Washington/Mexicali.

Under supply agreements entered into
with Conexant and Jazz Semiconductor, we receive wafer fabrication, wafer probe and
certain other services from Jazz Semiconductor. Pursuant to these supply agreements, we
are committed to obtain certain minimum wafer volumes from Jazz Semiconductor. Our
expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply agreements are anticipated to be
approximately $39 million and $13 million in fiscal 2004 and 2005, respectively.

Based on our fiscal 2003 results of
operations and current trends, and after giving effect to the net proceeds we received in
our private placement of 4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007, our debt
refinancing with Conexant, our common stock public offering and our Facility Agreement, we
expect our existing sources of liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from
operations, will be sufficient to fund our research and development, capital expenditures,
debt obligations, purchase obligations, working capital and other cash requirements for at
least the next twelve months.

OTHER MATTERS

Inflation did not have a significant
impact upon our results of operations during the three-year period ended September 30,
2003.

In July 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangibles.” SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives are not amortized into results of operations, but instead are
evaluated at least annually for impairment and written down when the recorded value
exceeds the estimated fair value. We adopted SFAS No. 142 on October 1, 2002, and
performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill. The goodwill impairment test is a
two-step process. The first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our
net book value. In determining fair value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of several
valuation methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of
fair value. As part of the first step, we determined that we have one reporting unit for
purposes of performing the fair-value based test of goodwill. This reporting unit is
consistent with its single operating segment, which management determined is appropriate
under the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information.” We completed step one and determined that our goodwill and
unamortized intangible assets were impaired. Step two of the analysis compares the implied
fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds
its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. We
completed step two and determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill was $397.1
million greater than its implied fair value. This transitional impairment charge was
recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003. In
addition, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2003 and determined
that as of July 1, 2003, our goodwill was not further impaired.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It requires that the
fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period
in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. We adopted the
provisions or SFAS No. 143 on October 1, 2002 and its adoption did not have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which
supersedes previous guidance on financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of. We adopted
SFAS No. 144 on October 1, 2002 and recorded asset impairment charges in accordance with
its guidance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. These charges primarily related to
certain infrastructure products manufactured at our Woburn, Massachusetts and Adamstown,
Maryland facilities.

In
April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statement No.‘s 4,
44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13 and Technical Corrections,” effective for fiscal
years beginning May 15, 2002 or later. It rescinds SFAS No. 4, “Reporting Gains and
Losses From Extinguishments of Debt,” SFAS No. 64, “Extinguishments of Debt to
Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements,” and SFAS No. 44, “Accounting for Intangible
Assets of Motor Carriers.” This Statement also amends SFAS No. 13, “Accounting
for Leases,” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for
sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications
that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions. This Statement also
amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections,
clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions. We adopted SFAS
No. 145 on October 1, 2002 and its adoption did not have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated With Exit or Disposal Activities.”
SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or
disposal plan. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. We adopted SFAS No. 146 on October 1, 2002 and its adoption did not
have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN
45”). FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, a guarantor must recognize a
liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee. FIN 45 also
requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial
statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued. The recognition
provisions of FIN 45 are effective for any guarantees that are issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. We adopted FIN 45 on January 1, 2003 and its adoption did not have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and
Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to
the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results.
SFAS No. 148 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years and interim periods
ending after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No.
148 on December 15, 2002 and continues to follow APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,” in accounting for employee stock options.

In January 2003, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN
46”). FIN 46 clarifies situations in which entities shall be subject to
consolidation. FIN 46 is effective for all variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003. We adopted FIN 46 on April 1, 2003 and its adoption did not have an
impact on our financial position or results of operations.

CERTAIN BUSINESS RISKS

We operate in the highly cyclical
wireless communications semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.

From
time to time changes in general economic conditions, together with other factors, cause
significant upturns and downturns in the industry. Periods of industry downturn, as we
experienced beginning in calendar year 2001, have been characterized by diminished product
demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average
selling prices. These characteristics, and in particular their impact on the level of
demand for digital cellular handsets, may cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues
and results of operations.

During
the late 1990‘s and extending into 2000, the wireless communications semiconductor
industry enjoyed unprecedented growth, benefiting from the rapid expansion of wireless
communication services worldwide and increased demand for digital cellular handsets.
However, beginning in calendar year 2001, we were adversely impacted by a global economic
slowdown and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end-user products that
incorporate our products and system solutions, particularly cellular handsets. The impact
of weakened end-customer demand was compounded by higher than normal levels of inventories
among our original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, subcontractor and distributor
customers. Should the reduced end-customer demand continue, this could result in
underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and other impacts
that would continue to materially and adversely affect our operating results.

Because
of the cyclical nature of the wireless communications semiconductor industry, we cannot
assure you of the timing, duration or magnitude of any recovery in our industry or that a
recovery will occur. We cannot assure you that the wireless communications semiconductor
industry will not experience renewed, and possibly more severe and prolonged, downturns in
the future, or that our operating results or financial condition will not be adversely
affected by them. We have experienced these cyclical fluctuations in our business and may
experience cyclical fluctuations in the future.

We have recently incurred
substantial operating losses and may experience future losses.

Our
operating results have been adversely affected by a global economic slowdown, concerns
about inflation, decreased consumer confidence, reduced capital spending, adverse business
conditions, and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries. These
factors have lead to an to a slowdown in customer orders, an increase in the number of
cancellations and reschedulings of backlog, higher overhead costs as a percentage of our
reduced net revenue, and an abrupt decline in demand for many of the end-user products
that incorporate wireless communications semiconductor products and system solutions. As a
result, we continued to incur operating losses during fiscal 2003 and may experience
operating losses in the future. Should the reduced end-customer demand continue for any
reason, this could result in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, reduced
revenues or changes in our revenue mix, and other factors that could continue to
materially and adversely affect our operating results in the near term. Due to these
economic factors, we cannot assure you as to whether or when we will become profitable or
whether we will be able to sustain such profitability, if achieved.

Additionally, the conflict in Iraq as well as other contemporary international conflicts,
acts of terrorism and civil and military unrest have augmented the economic slowdown.
These continuing and potentially escalating conflicts can be expected to place further
pressure on economic conditions in the United States and worldwide. These conditions make
it extremely difficult for our customers, our vendors and for us to accurately forecast
and plan future business activities. If such conditions continue or worsen, our business,
financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely
affected.

The wireless semiconductor markets
are characterized by intense competition.

The
wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the markets in which we
compete in particular are intensely competitive. We compete with U.S. and international
semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share. We
currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and
product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to
continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased
challenges in maintaining or increasing market share. Furthermore, additional competitors
may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics,
the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological
and public policy changes. We believe that the principal competitive factors for
semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:

•   time-to-market;

•   timely new product innovation;

•   product quality, reliability and performance;

•   product price;

•   features available in products;

•   compliance with industry standards;

•   strategic relationships with customers; and

•   access to and protection of intellectual property.

We
cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our
competitors enjoy the benefit of:

•   long presence in key markets;

•   name recognition;

•   high levels of customer satisfaction;

•   ownership or control of key technology or intellectual property; and

•   strong
financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical or other resources.

As
a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or
emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote
greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.

Current
and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish financial or
strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers or other third
parties. These relationships may affect customers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly,
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and
rapidly acquire significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition
could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins and loss of market share and
may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our success depends upon our
ability to develop new products and reduce costs in a timely manner.

The
wireless communications semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and characterized by
constant and rapid technological change, rapid product evolution, price erosion, evolving
technical standards, short product life cycles, increasing demand for higher levels of
integration and increased miniaturization, and wide fluctuations in product supply and
demand. In particular, the markets into which we sell demand cutting-edge technologies and
new and innovative products. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to
continue to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis. The development and
commercialization of semiconductor devices, modules and system solutions is highly
complex. Successful product development and introduction depends on numerous factors,
including:

•   the ability to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in
technology and industry standards;

•   the ability to obtain capacity
sufficient to meet customer demand;

•   the ability to define new products
that meet customer and market requirements;

•   the ability to complete
development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis;

•   the ability to differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors;

•   overall market acceptance of our products; and

•   the
ability to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our new products.

We
cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the substantial
investment in research and development needed to develop and bring to market new and
enhanced products in a timely manner. We will be required to continually evaluate
expenditures for planned product development and to choose among alternative technologies
based on our expectations of future market growth. We cannot assure you that we will be
able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications semiconductor
products in a timely and cost-effective manner, that our products will satisfy customer
requirements or achieve market acceptance or that we will be able to anticipate new
industry standards and technological changes. We also cannot assure you that we will be
able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors
or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties
to which our products interface.

In
addition, prices of products may decline, sometimes significantly, over time. We believe
that to remain competitive we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering
existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to reduce the cost of our products
to remain competitive.

The markets into which we sell our
products are characterized by rapid technological change.

The
demand for our products can change quickly and in ways we may not anticipate. Our markets
generally exhibit the following characteristics:

•   rapid technological developments and product evolution;

•   rapid changes in customer requirements;

•   frequent new product introductions and enhancements;

•   demand for higher levels of integration, decreased size and decreased power consumption;

•   short product life cycles with declining prices over the life cycle of the
product; and

•   evolving industry standards.

These
changes in our markets may contribute to the obsolescence of our products. Our products
could become obsolete or less competitive sooner than anticipated because of a faster than
anticipated change in one or more of the above-noted factors.

The ability to attract and retain
qualified personnel to contribute to the design, development, manufacture and sale of our
products is critical to our success.

As
the source of our technological and product innovations, our key technical personnel
represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract,
retain and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key
management and technical personnel. The competition for management and technical personnel
is intense in the semiconductor industry, and we therefore cannot assure you that we will
be able to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel necessary for the
design, development, manufacture and sale of our products. We may have particular
difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating
performance, given, among other things, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our
competitors. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability
to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect
on our ability to operate our business.

If
OEMs and ODMs of communications electronics products do not design our products into their
equipment, we will have

difficulty selling those products. Moreover, a
“design win” from a customer does not guarantee future sales to that customer

Our
products will not be sold directly to the end-user but will be components or subsystems of
other products. As a result, we will rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications
electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be
designed into their equipment. Without these “design wins,” we would have
difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another supplier’s product
into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design
wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort
and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer
does not ensure that we will receive significant revenues from that customer. Even after a
design win, the customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any
time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not
commercially successful, or for any other reason. We cannot assure you that we will
continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales.

Lengthy product development and
sales cycles associated with many of our products may result in significant expenditures
before generating any revenues related to those products.

After
our product is has been developed, tested, and manufactured, our customers may need three
to six months or longer to integrate, test and evaluate our products and an additional
three to six months or more to begin volume production of equipment incorporates the
products. This lengthy cycle time increases the possibility that a customer may decide to
cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that
customer. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and
development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, before we generate
the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the
anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels
or changes its product plans.

Uncertainties involving the
ordering and shipment of our products could adversely affect our business.

Our
sales will typically be made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under
long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may cancel orders before
shipment. Additionally, we will sell a portion of our products through distributors, some
of whom will have rights to return unsold products. We may purchase and manufacture
inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to
predict. This difficulty may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through
distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be
based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers may change
their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. The cancellation or deferral of
product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change
in anticipated order volumes, could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory,
which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition.

Our reliance on a small number of
customers for a large portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on the
results of our operations.

A
significant portion of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If
we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers
significantly decreased its orders of our products, our business would be materially and
adversely affected. Sales to Samsung Electronics Co. and to Motorola, Inc. represented
approximately 15% and 11%, respectively, of net revenues for fiscal 2003. Our future
operating results will depend on the success of these customers and other customers and
our success in selling products to them.

Average product life cycles in the
semiconductor industry tend to be very short

.

In
the semiconductor industry, product life cycles tend to be short relative to the sales and
development cycles. Therefore, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may
not result in material revenue, and from time to time we may need to write off excess or
obsolete inventory. If we were to incur significant marketing expenses and investments in
inventory that we are not able to recover, and we are not able to compensate for those
expenses, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected. In addition,
if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still
hold higher cost products in inventory, our operating results would be harmed.

Our leverage and our debt service
obligations may adversely affect our cash flow.

On
September 30, 2003, after giving effect to unused availability under our receivable
financing credit facility with Wachovia Bank, National Association, we would have had
total indebtedness of approximately $325 million, which would have represented
approximately 34% of our total capitalization.

As
long as our 4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding, we will have
debt service obligations on such notes of approximately $10,925,000 per year in interest
payments. In addition, we will have debt service obligations on our 15 percent convertible
senior subordinated notes due June 30, 2005, originally issued to Conexant, of
approximately $6,750,000 per year. If we issue other debt securities in the future, our
debt service obligations will increase. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to
meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments, we may have
to reduce or curtail other activities of our business.

We
intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations, if
any, and from our existing cash and investments. If necessary, among other alternatives,
we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and we may obtain other
long-term debt, lines of credit and other financing.

Our
indebtedness could have significant negative consequences, including:

•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry
conditions;

•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;

•   requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from
operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available
for other purposes, including capital expenditures;

•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our
business and the industry in which we compete; and

•   placing us at a
possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have
better access to capital
resources.

Despite our
current debt levels, we are able to incur substantially more debt, which would increase
the risks described above.

We face a risk that capital needed
for our business will not be available when we need it.

We
will need to obtain sources of financing in the future. After giving effect to the net
proceeds of our $102 million offering on or about September 12, 2003, our $230 million
private placement of 4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007, our $45 million
debt refinancing with Conexant and our receivables financing credit facility with Wachovia
Bank, National Association, we believe that our existing sources of liquidity, together
with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our
research and development, capital expenditure, working capital and other financing
requirements for at least the next twelve months.

However,
we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in
the future. Conditions existing in the U.S. capital markets when we seek financing as well
as the then current condition of the Company will affect our ability to raise capital, as
well as the terms of any financing. We may not be able to raise enough capital to meet our
capital needs on a timely basis or at all. Failure to obtain capital when required would
have a material adverse effect on the Company.

In
addition, any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our
business may require additional capital resources. We cannot assure you that the capital
required to fund these investments and acquisitions will be available in the future.

Our manufacturing
processes are extremely complex and specialized.

Our
manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including for causes
beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and
precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a
highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room
environment, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to
print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of
other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die
on each wafer to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our
ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors
present could have a material adverse affect on our business. In addition, we may discover
from time to time defects in our products after they have been shipped,
which may require us to replace such products.

Additionally,
our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of
our production facilities or those of our subcontractors. These disruptions may include
electrical power outages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, or other
natural or man-made disasters. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations could cause
significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected
facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor. In the event of such
delays, we cannot assure you that the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer
production capacity, would be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative
wafer production or assembly and test capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain
it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers. We
may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either at our
own facilities or through external manufacturing or similar arrangements with others.

Due
to the highly specialized nature of the gallium arsenide integrated circuit manufacturing
process, in the event of a disruption at the Newbury Park, California or Woburn,
Massachusetts semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities, alternative gallium arsenide
production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These
disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

We may not be able to maintain and
improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and
profitability.

Minor
deviations or perturbations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial
manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended.
Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product
development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the
product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of
improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and
actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and
profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and
maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to
be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products.
Our manufacturing operations will also face pressures arising from the compression of
product life cycles, which will require us to manufacture new products faster and for
shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in
many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher
manufacturing yields and declining costs.

We are dependent upon third
parties for the manufacture, assembly and test of our products.

We
rely upon independent wafer fabrication facilities, called foundries, to provide
silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing
capacity. We also utilize subcontractors to package, assemble and test our products. There
are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:

•   the lack of ensured wafer supply, potential wafer shortages and higher wafer
prices;

•   limited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production
costs and quality assurance; and

•   the inaccessibility of, or delays in
obtaining access to, key process technologies.

Although
we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing
capacity, the third-party foundries we use may allocate their limited capacity to the
production requirements of other customers. If we choose to use a new foundry, it will
typically take an extended period of time to complete the qualification process before we
can begin shipping products from the new foundry. The foundries may experience financial
difficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner or suffer damage or
destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in earthquake
zones. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative
manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties or
delays in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to
meet our customers’ needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating
results.

We are dependent upon third
parties for the supply of raw materials and components.

Our
manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and the
components used in our manufacturing processes. We believe we have adequate sources for
the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers
located around the world. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for
our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a sole-source supplier for epitaxial
wafers used in the gallium arsenide semiconductor manufacturing processes at our
manufacturing facilities. We cannot assure you that we will not lose a significant or sole
supplier or that a supplier will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or
delivery schedules. If we lost a supplier or a supplier were unable to meet performance or
quality specifications or delivery schedules, our ability to satisfy customer obligations
could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we review our relationships with
suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis.
In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with
one or more suppliers. We may also enter into other sole supplier arrangements to meet
certain of our raw material or component needs. If we were to enter into an additional
sole supplier arrangement for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated
with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated.

Under
supply agreements entered into with Conexant and Jazz Semiconductor, Inc. we receive wafer
fabrication, wafer probe and certain other services from Jazz Semiconductor. Pursuant to
these supply agreements, we are committed to obtaining certain minimum wafer volumes from
Jazz Semiconductor. Our expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply
agreements are anticipated to be approximately $39 million and $13 million, respectively,
in fiscal 2004 and 2005.

Remaining competitive in the
semiconductor industry requires transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies and
achieving higher levels of design integration.

In order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor
products to increasingly smaller line width geometries. This transition requires us to
modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent
standards, and to redesign some existing products. In the past, we have experienced some
difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing
processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product
deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses
as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In
some instances, we depend on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller
geometry processes successfully. We cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to
effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry
relationships. If our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or
fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry
processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of
functionality, as well as customer and third party intellectual property, into our
products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or
deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.

We are subject to the
risks of doing business internationally.

Historically,
a substantial majority of the Company’s net revenues from customers other than
Conexant were derived from customers located outside the United States, primarily
countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. In addition, we have design
centers and suppliers located outside the United States, and third-party packaging,
assembly and test facilities and foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, we
have our own packaging, assembly and test facility in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international
sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating
abroad. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:

•   currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•   local economic and political conditions, including social, economic and
political instability;

•   disruptions of capital and trading markets;

•   restrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of
funds and trade protection measures, including export duties,
quotas, customs duties, import or export controls and tariffs);

•   changes in legal or regulatory requirements;

•   natural disasters, acts of terrorism, widespread illness and war;

•   limitations on the repatriation of funds;

•   difficulty in obtaining distribution and support;

•   cultural differences in the conduct of
business;

•   the laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting
trade, foreign investment and loans, and import or export

•   licensing requirements;

•   tax laws;

•   the possibility of being exposed to legal proceedings in a foreign
jurisdiction; and

•   limitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our
intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.

Additionally, we are subject to risks
in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales
to their customers. Increases in handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can
result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand
for our products. Limitations or changes in policy on phone subsidies in South Korea,
Japan, China and other countries may have additional negative impacts on our revenues.

Our operating results may be
adversely affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns.

Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated in the past and our
revenues, earnings and other operating results may fluctuate in the future. These
fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.

These factors include, among others:

•   changes in end-user demand for the products (principally digital cellular
handsets) manufactured and sold by our customers;

•   the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our
products;

•   production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing
yields;

•   availability and cost of products from our suppliers;

•   the gain or loss of significant customers;

• our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis;

•   new product and technology introductions by competitors;

•   changes in the mix of products produced and sold;

•   market acceptance of our products and our customers;

• intellectual property disputes;

The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors,
could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. If our
operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could
materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock

.

Global economic conditions that
impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and
operating results.

Global
economic weakness can have wide-ranging effects on markets that we serve, particularly
wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators. The wireless
communications industry appears to be recovering from an industry-wide recession. We
cannot predict whether a recovery will continue, the rate of any such recovery, or what
effects negative events, such as war, may have on the economy or the wireless
communications industry. The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and
military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause
further disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless communications industry and
create further uncertainties. Further, an economic recovery may not benefit us in the near
term. If it does not, our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating
results may be impaired.

Our gallium arsenide
semiconductors may cease to be competitive with silicon alternatives.

Among our product portfolio, we manufacture and sell gallium arsenide semiconductor
devices and components, principally power amplifiers and switches. The production of
gallium arsenide integrated circuits is more costly than the production of silicon
circuits. The cost differential is due to higher costs of raw materials for gallium
arsenide and higher unit costs associated with smaller sized wafers and lower production
volumes. Therefore, to remain competitive we must offer gallium arsenide products that
provide superior performance over their silicon-based counterparts. If we do not continue
to offer products that provide sufficiently superior performance to justify the cost
differential, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We expect
the costs of producing gallium arsenide devices will continue to exceed the costs of
producing their silicon counterparts. Silicon semiconductor technologies are widely-used
process technologies for certain integrated circuits and these technologies continue to
improve in performance. We cannot assure you that we will continue to identify products
and markets that require performance attributes of gallium arsenide solutions.

We may be subject to claims of
infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license
third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from
using our technology.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of
intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in
the future assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to
technologies that are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future
demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it. At the present time, we
are in discussions with Qualcomm Incorporated regarding claims each of us have filed and
served against the other asserting violations of certain of our respective intellectual
property rights. The purpose of these discussions is to arrive at a business resolution
that avoids protracted litigation for both parties. We believe their claims are without
merit and if we are not successful resolving this matter outside of litigation, we are
prepared to vigorously defend against their claims and fully prosecute our claims against
them.

Any litigation to determine the validity of claims that our products infringe or may
infringe intellectual property rights of another, including claims arising from our
contractual indemnification of our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution,
could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical
personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we cannot assure you that we
would prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent
uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If litigation were to result in an
adverse ruling, we could be required to:

•   pay substantial damages;

•   cease the manufacture, import, use, sale or offer for sale of infringing
products or processes;

•   discontinue the use of infringing technology;

•   expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology; and

•   license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which
license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.

We cannot assure you that our operating results or financial condition will not be
adversely affected if we were required to do any one or more of the foregoing items.

Many of our products incorporate
technology licensed or acquired from third parties.

We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes,
evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles
and increasing levels of integration. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on
our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to
allow our products to remain in a competitive posture. If licenses to such technology are
not available on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, and we cannot otherwise
integrate such technology, our products or our customers’ products could become
unmarketable or obsolete, and we could lose market share. In such instances, we could also
incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop substitute
technology to deliver competitive products.

If we are not successful in
protecting our intellectual property rights, it may harm our ability to compete.

We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property
laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to
protect our proprietary technologies, information, data, devices, algorithms and
processes. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers,
suppliers or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to
the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. In the future,
it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual
property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of
proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend
significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and
technical personnel from our business operations. We cannot assure you that:

•   the steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other
violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers,
suppliers or other third parties will be successful;

•   any existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other
intellectual property rights or ours will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented;
or

•   any of the measures described above would provide meaningful protection.

Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise
obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology
independently or design around our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection
mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to
offer similar products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion.
In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be
unavailable or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.

Our success depends, in part, on
our ability to effect suitable investments, alliances and acquisitions, and to integrate
companies we acquire, and on our continued success integrating the wireless business of
Conexant with the Company.

Although we intend to invest significant resources in internal research and development
activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant
expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue
development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we intend to
review investment, alliance and acquisition prospects that would complement our product
offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. However,
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate suitable investment,
alliance or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if we consummate such
transactions, they could result in:

•   issuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders;  
•   large one-time write-offs;

•   the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities;

•   the potential loss of key employees from the acquired company;

•   amortization expenses related to intangible assets; and

•   the diversion of management’s attention
from other business concerns.

Moreover,
integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult,
expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationship with
employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods
following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related
intangible assets for impairment. When such assets are found to be impaired, they will be
written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings. For instance, we
recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003 in the
amount of $397.1 million as a result of the goodwill obtained in connection with the
Merger.

We may be responsible for payment
of a substantial amount of U.S. federal income and other taxes upon certain events.

In connection with Conexant’s spin-off of its wireless business prior to the Merger,
Conexant sought and received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that
certain transactions related to and including the spin-off qualified as a reorganization
and as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. While the tax ruling generally is
binding on the Internal Revenue Service, the continuing validity of the ruling is subject
to certain factual representations and assumptions. In connection with the Merger we
entered into a tax allocation agreement with Conexant that generally provides, among other
things, that we will be responsible for certain taxes imposed on various persons
(including Conexant) as a result of either:

•   the failure of certain spin-off transactions to qualify as a reorganization
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or

•   the failure of certain
spin-off transactions to qualify as tax-free to Conexant for certain U.S. federal
income tax purposes,

if such failure is attributable to
certain actions or transactions by or in respect of Skyworks (including our subsidiaries)
or our stockholders, such as the acquisition of stock of Skyworks by a third party at a
time and in a manner that would cause such failure. In addition, the tax allocation
agreement provides that we will be responsible for various other tax obligations and for
compliance with various representations, statements, and conditions made in the course of
obtaining the tax ruling referenced above and in connection with the tax allocation
agreement. Our obligations under the tax allocation agreement have been limited by a
letter agreement dated November 6, 2002 entered into in connection with our debt
refinancing with Conexant. Nevertheless, if we do not carefully monitor our compliance
with the requirements imposed as a result of the spin-off and related transactions and our
responsibilities under the tax allocation agreement, we might inadvertently trigger an
obligation to indemnify certain persons (including Conexant) pursuant to the tax
allocation agreement or other obligations under such agreement. In addition, our indemnity
obligations could discourage or prevent a third party from making a proposal to acquire
Skyworks.

If we were required to pay any of the taxes described above, the payment could be very
substantial and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flow.

In addition, it is expected that the interest payments we are required to make on our
$45 million principal amount of 15% convertible subordinated notes due June 30,
2005 originally issued to Conexant will not be deductible for tax purposes. Our inability
to offset our interest expense from these notes against other income may increase our tax
liability currently and in future years.

Further, the terms of these senior subordinated notes require us to pay the principal due
at the maturity date or upon certain acceleration events in a number of shares of our
common stock equal to the principal due at such time divided by the applicable conversion
price on such date. If the fair market value of our common stock on such date is less than
the applicable conversion price, we may recognize cancellation of indebtedness income for
tax purposes equal to the excess of the principal amount of these notes due at such time
over the fair market value of the common stock issued by us to satisfy our obligations
under these notes.

Certain provisions in our
organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire
control of us.

We have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate
of incorporation, our by-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several
provisions that would make more difficult an acquisition of control of us in a transaction
not approved by our board of directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws
include provisions such as:

•   the division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a
staggered basis, one class each year;

•   the ability of our board of
directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further
authorization of stockholders;

•   a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent;

•   elimination
of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;

•   a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder
nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting
of stockholders;

•   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 percent
of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal any provision of our by-laws or the provision
of our certificate of incorporation relating to amendments to our by-laws;

•   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of our
shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation
relating to the election and removal of directors, the classified board or the right to
act by written consent;

•   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of our
shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members
of the board of directors and, in the event that the other party to the business
combination is the beneficial owner of 5 percent or more of our shares, a majority of
the members of board of directors in office prior to the time such other party became the
beneficial owner of 5 percent or more of our shares;

•   a fair price provision; and

•   a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90 percent of our
shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.

In addition to the provisions in our certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General

Corporation Law generally provides
that a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested
stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes
an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves
either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder
becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met.

We may be liable for penalties
under environmental laws, rules and regulations, which could adversely impact our
business.

We have used, and will continue to use, a variety of chemicals and compounds in
manufacturing operations and have been and will continue to be subject to a wide range of
environmental protection regulations in the United States. While we have not experienced
any material adverse effect on our operations as a result of such regulations, we cannot
assure you that current or future regulations would not have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental regulations
often require parties to fund remedial action regardless of fault. Consequently, it is
often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including
potential liabilities. We cannot assure you that the amount of expense and capital
expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete
remedial actions and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws will not
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our stock price has been volatile
and may fluctuate in the future. Accordingly, you might not be able to sell your shares of
common stock at or above the price you paid for them.

The trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly.
Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:

•   our performance and prospects;

•   the performance and prospects of our major customers;

•   the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;

•   investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;

•   changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;

•   general financial and other market conditions; and

•   domestic and
international economic conditions.

Public stock markets have experienced, and are currently experiencing, extreme price and
trading volume volatility, particularly in the technology sectors of the market. This
volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology
companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the
operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations may materially
and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

In addition, fluctuations in our stock price and our price-to-earnings multiple may have
made our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift
funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction,
particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis.

ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are subject to market risks, such
as changes in currency and interest rates, that arise from normal business operation. Our
financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt and long-term
debt. Our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital.
Consequently, we invest with only high-credit-quality issuers and we limit the amount of
our credit exposure to any one issuer. We do not use derivative instruments for
speculative or investment purposes.

Our cash and cash equivalents are not
subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these
instruments. As of September 30, 2003, the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents
approximates fair value. Our short-term debt primarily consists of borrowings under our
receivables purchase agreement. As of September 30, 2003, we had borrowed $41.7 million
under this agreement. In addition, our short-term debt includes the remaining portion of a
ten-year $960,000 loan from the State of Maryland under the Community Development Block
Grant program due December 2003 at an interest rate of 5 percent. Interest related to our
short-term debt is at a fixed rate. Consequently, we do not have significant cash flow
exposure on our short-term debt.

We issued fixed-rate debt, which is
convertible into our common stock at a predetermined or market related conversion price.
Convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interest-rate risk and market
risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current
interest-rate environment and the price of the underlying common stock. For the year ended
September 30, 2003 our convertible debt, on an if-converted basis, was not dilutive and,
as a result, had no impact on our net income per share (assuming dilution). In future
periods, the debt may be converted, or the if-converted method may be dilutive and net
income per share (assuming dilution) would be reduced. Our long-term debt consists of $230
million of 4.75 percent unsecured convertible subordinated notes due November 2007 and $45
million of 15 percent unsecured convertible senior subordinated notes due June 2005. We do
not believe that we have significant cash flow exposure on our long-term debt.

Based on our overall evaluation of
our market risk exposures from all of our financial instruments at September 30, 2003 a
near-term change in market rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.     DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Skyworks Solutions, Inc.
(“Skyworks” or the “Company”) is a leading wireless semiconductor
company focused exclusively on radio frequency (“RF”) and complete cellular
system solutions for mobile communications applications. The Company offers front-end
modules, RF subsystems and cellular systems to leading wireless handset and infrastructure
customers.

On June 25, 2002, pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of December 16, 2001, as amended as of
April 12, 2002, by and among Alpha Industries, Inc. (“Alpha”), Conexant Systems,
Inc. (“Conexant”) and Washington Sub, Inc. (“Washington”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Conexant to which Conexant spun off its wireless communications
business, including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication facility located in Newbury
Park, California, but excluding certain assets and liabilities, Washington merged with and
into Alpha with Alpha as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). Following the
Merger, Alpha changed its corporate name to Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

Immediately following completion of
the Merger, the Company purchased Conexant’s semiconductor assembly, module
manufacturing and test facility located in Mexicali, Mexico, and certain related
operations (“Mexicali Operations”) for $150 million. For financial accounting
purposes, the sale of the Mexicali Operations by Conexant to Skyworks Solutions was
treated as if Conexant had contributed the Mexicali Operations to Washington as part of
the spin-off, and the $150 million purchase price was treated as a return of capital to
Conexant. For purposes of these financial statements, the Washington business and the
Mexicali Operations are collectively referred to as Washington/Mexicali. References to the
“Company” refer to Washington/Mexicali for all periods prior to June 26, 2002,
and to the combined company following the Merger.

The Merger was accounted for as a
reverse acquisition whereby Washington was treated as the acquirer and Alpha as the
acquiree, primarily because Conexant shareholders owned a majority, approximately 67
percent, of the Company upon completion of the Merger. Under a reverse acquisition, the
purchase price of Alpha was based upon the fair market value of Alpha common stock for a
reasonable period of time before and after the announcement date of the Merger and the
fair value of Alpha stock options. The purchase price of Alpha was allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed by Washington, as the acquiring company for accounting
purposes, based upon their estimated fair market value at the acquisition date. Because
the historical financial statements of the Company after the Merger do not include the
historical financial results of Alpha for periods prior to June 25, 2002, the financial
statements may not be indicative of future results of operations and are not indicative of
the historical results that would have resulted if the Merger had occurred at the
beginning of a historical financial period.

The financial statements prior to the
Merger were prepared using Conexant’s historical basis in the assets and liabilities
and the historical operating results of Washington/Mexicali during each respective period.
Management believes the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable.
However, there can be no assurance that the financial information included herein reflects
the combined assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the Company in the
future or what they would have been had Washington/Mexicali been a separate stand-alone
entity and independent of Conexant during the periods presented.

Conexant used a centralized approach
to cash management and the financing of its operations. Cash deposits from
Washington/Mexicali were transferred to Conexant on a regular basis and were netted
against Conexant’s net investment. As a result, none of Conexant’s cash, cash
equivalents, marketable securities or debt was allocated to Washington/Mexicali in the
financial statements. Cash and cash equivalents in the financial statements, prior to the
acquisition, represented amounts held by certain foreign operations of
Washington/Mexicali. Changes in equity represented funding from Conexant for working
capital and capital expenditure requirements after giving effect to
Washington/Mexicali’s transfers to and from Conexant for its cash flows from
operations through June 25, 2002.

Historically, Conexant provided
financing for Washington/Mexicali and incurred debt at the parent level. The financial
statements for the periods prior to June 25, 2002 of Washington/Mexicali do not include an
allocation of Conexant’s debt or the related interest expense. Therefore, the
financial statements do not necessarily reflect the financial position and results of
operations of Washington/Mexicali had it been an independent company as of the dates, and
for the periods, presented.

The financial statements for the
periods prior to the Merger also include allocations of certain Conexant operating
expenses for research and development, legal, accounting, treasury, human resources, real
estate, information systems, distribution, customer service, sales, marketing, engineering
and other corporate services provided by Conexant, including executive salaries and other
costs. The operating expense allocations have been determined on bases that management
considered to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided to, or the
benefit received by, Washington/Mexicali. Management believes that the expenses allocated
to Washington/Mexicali are representative of the operating expenses that would have been
incurred had Washington/Mexicali operated as an independent company. Since the date of the
Merger, the Company has been performing these functions using its own resources or
purchased services, including certain services obtained from Conexant pursuant to a
transition services agreement, most of which expired on December 31, 2002. The Company
expects to transition the remaining services from Conexant to third party providers before
the end of fiscal 2004.

NOTE 2.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of
Consolidation:

The
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Year:

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2003
consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal years 2002 and 2001 each consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal
years 2003, 2002 and 2001 ended on October 3, 2003, September 27, 2002 and September 28,
2001, respectively. For convenience, the consolidated financial statements have been shown
as ending on the last day of the calendar month.

Use of Estimates:

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management
reviews its estimates based upon currently available information. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates.

The
combined financial statements have been prepared using Conexant’s historical basis in
the assets and liabilities and the historical operating results of Washington/Mexicali
during each respective period. The Company believes the assumptions underlying the
financial statements are reasonable. However, the Company cannot assure you that the
financial information included herein reflects the combined assets, liabilities, operating
results and cash flows of the Company in the future or what they would have been had
Washington/Mexicali been a separate stand-alone entity and independent of Conexant during
the periods presented.

Revenue Recognition:

Revenues
from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title, in accordance with
the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer. Revenue recognition is
deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete. Certain product sales
are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price
protection and/or a right of return on unsold products. A reserve for sales returns and
allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific
identification of an event necessitating a reserve.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash
and cash equivalents include cash deposited in demand deposits at banks and highly liquid
investments with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Short-term Investments:

The
Company’s short-term investments are classified as held-to-maturity. These
investments consist of commercial paper with original maturities of more than 90 days but
less than twelve months. Such short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value, due to the short period of time to maturity. Gains and losses are
included in investment income in the period they are realized.

Restricted Cash:

Restricted
cash is used to collateralize the Company’s obligation under a receivables purchase
agreement under which it has agreed to sell from time to time certain of its accounts
receivable to Skyworks USA, Inc. (“Skyworks USA”), a wholly-owned special
purpose entity that is fully consolidated for accounting purposes. Concurrently, Skyworks
USA entered into an agreement with Wachovia Bank, National Association providing for a $50
million credit facility (“Facility Agreement “) secured by the purchased
accounts receivable. See

Note 8

.

Accounts Receivable:

Accounts
receivable consist of amounts due from normal business activities. The Company maintains
allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Company’s
customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make future
payments, additional allowances may be required.

Inventories:

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. The
Company provides for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The recoverability of inventories
is assessed through an on-going review of inventory levels in relation to sales backlog
and forecasts, product marketing plans and product life cycles. When the inventory on hand
exceeds the foreseeable demand (generally in excess of six months), the value of such
inventory that is not expected to be sold at the time of the review is written down. The
amount of the write-down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value
(generally zero). Once established, these write-downs are considered permanent adjustments
to the cost basis of the excess inventory. If actual demand and market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be
required.

Property, Plant and
Equipment:

Property,
plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method for financial reporting and
accelerated methods for tax purposes. Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized
and replaced units are written off. Maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of a
minor amount, are expensed as incurred.

Estimated
useful lives used for depreciation purposes are 5 to 30 years for buildings and
improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are
depreciated over the lesser of the economic life or the life of the associated lease.

Property Held for Sale:

Property
held for sale at September 30, 2003 relates to land and buildings no longer in use and is
recorded at estimated fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company is actively
marketing the property held for sale.

Valuation of long-lived assets:

Carrying
values for long-lived assets and definitive lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill,
are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connections with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which was adopted on October 1,
2002. Impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be
recoverable. The determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted
cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition. The
estimate of cash flows is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about
expected future operating performance. The Company’s estimates of undiscounted cash
flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, technological changes,
economic conditions, changes to the Company’s business model or changes in its
operating performance. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is
less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss, measured as the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is
determined using discounted cash flows.

Goodwill and Intangible
Assets:

Goodwill
and intangible assets are principally the result of the Merger with Washington/Mexicali
completed on June 25, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangibles,” on October 1, 2002 and performed a transitional impairment test for
goodwill in fiscal 2003. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives are not amortized into results of operations, but instead are
evaluated at least annually for impairment and written down when the recorded value
exceeds the estimated fair value. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. The
first step of the impairment analysis compares the Company’s fair value to its net
book value. In determining fair value, SFAS No. 142 allows for the use of several
valuation methodologies, although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of
fair value. As part of the first step, the Company determined that it has one reporting
unit for purposes of performing the fair-value based test of goodwill. This reporting unit
is consistent with the Company’s single operating segment, which management
determined is appropriate under the provisions of SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” The Company completed step one
and determined that its goodwill and unamortized intangible assets were impaired. Step two
of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. If the
carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is
recognized equal to that excess. The Company completed step two and determined that the
carrying amount of its goodwill was $397.1 million greater than its implied fair value.
This transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle in fiscal 2003. The Company tests its goodwill for impairment
annually as of the first day of its fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if
certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. The
Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2003 and determined that
as of July 1, 2003, its goodwill was not further impaired.

Deferred Financing Costs:

Financing
costs are capitalized as an asset on the Company’s balance sheet and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the financing.

Income Taxes:

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the
asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net
operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more
likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.

The
carrying value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets assumes that the Company will
be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based
on estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the
future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its
deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the Company’s
consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the
deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly.
Likewise, in the event that the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize
its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment
to the deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of
goodwill in the period such determination was made.

Research and Development
Expenditures:

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Product Warranties:

Warranties
are offered on the sale of certain products and an accrual is recorded for estimated
claims. The changes in the warranty reserve are as follows:

Foreign Currency
Translation and Remeasurement:

The
foreign operations of the Company are subject to exchange rate fluctuations and foreign
currency transaction costs. The functional currency for the Company’s foreign
operations is the U.S. dollar. Exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in the results
of operations for the year.  Inventories, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and
intangible assets, costs of goods sold, and depreciation and amortization are remeasured
from the foreign currency into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates; other accounts
are translated at current exchange rates. Gains and losses resulting from these
remeasurements are included in results of operations. The Company recorded a gain of $0.4
million related to these remeasurements in fiscal 2003.

Stock Option Plans:

The
Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) No.
25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations, in
accounting for employee stock options rather than the alternative fair value accounting
allowed by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” APB No. 25
provides that compensation expense relative to the Company’s employee stock options
is measured based on the intrinsic value of stock options granted and the Company
recognizes compensation expense in its statement of operations using the straight-line
method over the vesting period for fixed awards. Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of
stock options at the date of grant is recognized in earnings over the vesting period of
the options. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and
Disclosure.” SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123 to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the
effect of the method on reported results. SFAS No. 148 is effective for financial
statements for fiscal years and interim periods ending after December 15, 2002. The
Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 on December 27, 2002 and
continues to follow APB No. 25 in accounting for employee stock options.

No
stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted
under the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Prior to
the Merger with Alpha Industries, Inc., Conexant’s wireless business had no separate
capitalization. Therefore, the Company had no stock-based compensation prior to June 25,
2002.

Had
compensation cost for the Company’s stock option and stock purchase plans been
determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans
consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net
income (loss) would have been as follows:

For
purposes of pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, the estimated fair value of the
options is assumed to be amortized to expense over the options’ vesting period. The
fair value of the options granted has been estimated at the date of the grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
expected stock price volatility. Because options held by employees and directors have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes
in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the
opinion of management, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reasonable measure
of the fair value of these options.

Earnings Per Share:

Prior
to the Merger with Alpha, Conexant’s wireless business had no separate
capitalization. Therefore, a calculation cannot be performed for weighted average shares
outstanding to then calculate earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated
by dividing net income (loss) by the assumed weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of stock options and
a stock warrant, using the treasury stock method, and debt securities on an if converted
basis, if their effect is dilutive. For the year ended September 30, 2003, debt securities
convertible into 31.1 million shares, stock options exercisable into 25.8 million shares
and a warrant to purchase 1.0 million shares were outstanding but not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share as the net loss for this period would have made
their effect anti-dilutive. For the year ended September 30, 2002, options to purchase
31.3 million shares were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share as the net loss for this period would have made their effect
anti-dilutive.

Pensions and Retiree
Medical Benefits:

In
connection with Conexant’s spin-off of its Washington/Mexicali business, Conexant
transferred obligations to Washington/Mexicali for its pension plan and retiree benefits.
The amounts that were transferred relate to approximately twenty Washington/Mexicali
employees that had enrolled in Conexant’s Voluntary Early Retirement Plan
(“VERP”) in 1998. The VERP also provides health care benefits to members of the
plan. The Company currently does not offer pension plans or retiree benefits to its
employees.

The
costs and obligations of the Company’s pension and retiree medical plans are
calculated using many assumptions, the amount of which cannot be completely determined
until the benefit payments cease. The most significant assumptions, as presented in Note
12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, include discount rate, expected return on
plan assets and future trends in health care costs. The selection of assumptions is based
on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation.
Actual results may differ substantially from these assumptions. These differences may
significantly impact future pension or retiree medical expenses.

Annual
pension and retiree medical expense is principally the sum of three components: 1)
increase in liability from interest; less 2) expected return on plan assets; and 3) other
gains and losses as described below. The expected return on plan assets is calculated by
applying an assumed long-term rate of return to the fair value of plan assets. In any
given year, actual returns can differ significantly from the expected return. Differences
between the actual and expected return on plan assets are combined with gains or losses
resulting from the revaluation of plan liabilities. Plan liabilities are revalued
annually, based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals covered by
the plan. The combined gain or loss is generally expensed evenly over the remaining years
that employees are expected to work.

Comprehensive Income
(Loss):

The
Company accounts for comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income.” SFAS No. 130 is a financial statement
presentation standard that requires the Company to disclose non-owner changes included in
equity but not included in net income or loss. Comprehensive loss presented in the
combined financial statements of Conexant’s net investment consists of
Washington/Mexicali’s net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments prior to
the Merger. The foreign currency translation adjustments are not recorded net of any tax
effect, as management does not expect to incur any tax liability or benefit related
thereto. Accumulated other comprehensive loss, prior to the Merger, is included in
Conexant’s net investment in the combined balance sheets. Comprehensive loss, for
periods subsequent to the Merger, consists of an adjustment to the Company’s minimum
pension liability.

NOTE 3.     BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS

Merger with Conexant
Systems, Inc.‘s Wireless Business

On
December 16, 2001, Alpha, Conexant and Washington, a wholly owned subsidiary of Conexant,
entered into a definitive agreement providing for the combination of Conexant’s
wireless business with Alpha. Under the terms of the agreement, Conexant spun off its
wireless business into Washington, including its gallium arsenide wafer fabrication
facility located in Newbury Park, California, but excluding certain assets and
liabilities, followed immediately by the Merger of this wireless business into Alpha with
Alpha as the surviving entity in the Merger. The Merger was completed on June 25, 2002.
Following the Merger, Alpha changed its corporate name to Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

Immediately
following completion of the Merger, the Company purchased the Mexicali Operations for $150
million. For financial accounting purposes, the sale of the Mexicali Operations by
Conexant to Skyworks Solutions was treated as if Conexant had contributed the Mexicali
Operations to Washington as part of the spin-off, and the $150 million purchase price was
treated as a return of capital to Conexant.

The
Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby Washington was treated as the
acquirer and Alpha as the acquiree, primarily because Conexant shareholders owned a
majority, approximately 67 percent, of the Company upon completion of the Merger. Under a
reverse acquisition, the purchase price of Alpha was based upon the fair market value of
Alpha common stock for a reasonable period of time before and after the announcement date
of the Merger and the fair value of Alpha stock options. The purchase price of Alpha was
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Washington, as the acquiring
company for accounting purposes, based upon their estimated fair market value at the
acquisition date. Because the Merger was accounted for as a purchase of Alpha, the
historical financial statements of Washington/Mexicali became the historical financial
statements of the Company after the Merger. Since the historical financial statements of
the Company after the Merger do not include the historical financial results of Alpha for
periods prior to June 25, 2002, the financial statements may not be indicative of future
results of operations and are not indicative of the historical results that would have
resulted if the Merger had occurred at the beginning of a historical financial period.

In
connection with the Merger, the Company identified duplicate facilities resulting in a
write-down of fixed assets with historical carrying values of $92.4 million to $20.2
million, a reduction in workforce of approximately 210 employees at a cost of $4.8 million
and facility exit or closing costs of $3.1 million. The effects of these actions are
reflected in the purchase price allocation below.

The
total purchase price was valued at approximately $1.2 billion and is summarized as
follows:

Note 2

to the consolidated financial statements

In
connection with the Merger, $65.5 million was allocated to purchased in-process research
and development and expensed immediately upon completion of the acquisition (as a charge
not deductible for tax purposes) because the technological feasibility of certain products
under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed.

The
semiconductor segment was involved in several projects that have been aggregated into the following categories
based on the respective technologies:

Power Amplifier:

Power amplifiers are designed and manufactured for use in
different types of wireless handsets. The main performance attributes of these amplifiers are efficiency, power
output, operating voltage and distortion. Current research and development is focused on expanding the offering
to all types of wireless standards, improving performance by process and circuit improvements and offering a
higher level of integration.

Control Products:

Control products consist of switches and switch filters that are
used in wireless applications for signal routing. Most applications are in the handset market enabling
multi-mode, multi-band handsets. Current research and development is focused on performance improvement and
cost reduction by reducing chip size and increasing functionality.

Broadband:

The products in this grouping
consist of radio frequency (RF) and millimeter wave semiconductors and components designed and manufactured
specifically to address the needs of high-speed, wireline and wireless network access. Current and long-term
research and development is focused on performance enhancement of speed and bandwidth as well as cost reduction
and integration.

Silicon Diode:

These products use silicon processes to fabricate diodes for use in a variety of
RF and wireless applications. Current research and development is focused on reducing the size of the device,
improving performance and reducing cost.

Ceramics:

The ceramics segment was involved in projects that relate to
the design and manufacture of ceramic-based components such as resonators and filters for the wireless
infrastructure market. Current research and development is focused on performance enhancements through improved
formulations and electronic designs.

The material risks associated with
the successful completion of the in-process technology were associated with our ability to
successfully finish the creation of viable prototypes and successful design of the chips,
masks and manufacturing processes required. We expected to benefit from the in-process
projects as the individual products that contained the in-process technology were put into
production and sold to end-users. The release dates for each of the products within the
product families were varied. The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the
income approach. Under the income approach, the fair value reflected the present value of
the projected cash flows that were expected to be generated by the products incorporating
the IPR&D, if successful. The projected cash flows were discounted to approximate fair
value. The discount rate applicable to the cash flows of each project reflected the stage
of completion and other risks inherent in each project. The weighted average discount rate
used in the valuation of IPR&D was 30 percent. As of September 30, 2003, the Company had either completed or abandoned each of these projects.
 The completed IPR&D projects commenced
generating cash flows in fiscal 2003.  Due to the nature of these projects and the related technolgy, the revenue streams derived from these projects cannot be separately identified.

The
assessment of the recoverability of inventories, and the amounts of any write-downs, is
based on currently available information and assumptions about future demand and the
market conditions. Demand for products may fluctuate significantly over time, and actual
demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by
management. In the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected, additional
inventory write-downs may be required.

Some
or all of the inventories which have been written-down may be retained and made available
for sale. In the event that actual demand is higher than originally projected, a portion
of these inventories may be able to be sold in the future. Inventories which have been
written-down and are identified as obsolete are generally scrapped.

NOTE 6.     GOODWILL AND
INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The
Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles,” on October 1,
2002 and performed a transitional impairment test for goodwill. The goodwill impairment
test is a two-step process. The first step of the impairment analysis compares the
Company’s fair value to its net book value. In determining fair value, SFAS No. 142
allows for the use of several valuation methodologies, although it states quoted market
prices are the best evidence of fair value. As part of the first step, the Company
determined that it has one reporting unit for purposes of performing the fair-value based
test of goodwill. This reporting unit is consistent with its single operating segment,
which management determined is appropriate under the provisions of SFAS No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” The
Company completed step one and determined that its goodwill and unamortized intangible
assets were impaired. Step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill
to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value,
an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. The Company completed step two and
determined that the carrying amount of its goodwill was $397.1 million greater than its
implied fair value. This transitional impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal 2003. The Company tests its goodwill
for impairment annually as of the first day of its fourth fiscal quarter and in interim
periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be
impaired. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2003 and
determined that as of July 1, 2003, its goodwill was not further impaired.

Impairment losses in fiscal 2003 represent the write-down of assets related to the
Company’s infrastructure business and are included in special charges in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The
additions (deductions) in fiscal 2002 reflect the results of the purchase price allocation
of Alpha in the Merger. Impairment losses in fiscal 2002 represent the write-down of all
goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the Company’s acquisition of the
Philsar Bluetooth business and are included in special charges in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

In

Junior notes represent the
Company’s 4.75 percent convertible subordinated notes due 2007. These Junior notes
can be converted into 110.4911 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal balance, which
is the equivalent of a conversion price of approximately $9.05 per share. The Company may
redeem the Junior notes at any time after November 20, 2005. The redemption price of the
Junior notes during the period between November 20, 2005 through November 14, 2006 will be
$1,011.875 per $1,000 principal amount of notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the redemption date, and the redemption price of the notes beginning
on November 15, 2006 and thereafter will be $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of notes to
be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Holders may
require the Company to repurchase the Junior notes upon a change in control of the
Company. The Company will pay interest in cash semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and
November 15 of each year.

Senior notes represent the
Company’s 15 percent convertible senior subordinated notes due June 30, 2005, which
were issued as part of the Company’s debt refinancing with Conexant completed on
November 13, 2002. These Senior notes can be converted into the Company’s common
stock at a conversion rate based on the applicable conversion price, which is subject to
adjustment based on, among other things, the market price of the Company’s common
stock. Based on this adjustable conversion price, the Company expects that the maximum
number of shares that could be issued under the Senior notes is approximately 7.1 million
shares, subject to adjustment for stock splits and other similar dilutive occurrences. If
the holder(s) of these Senior notes converted the notes at a price that is less than the
original conversion price ($7.87) as the result of a decrease in the market price of the
Company’s stock, the Company would be required to record a charge to interest expense
in the period of conversion. At maturity (including upon certain acceleration events), the
Company will pay the principal amount of the Senior notes by issuing a number of shares of
common stock equal to the principal amount of the Senior notes then due and payable
divided by the applicable conversion price in effect on such date, together with cash in
lieu of any fractional shares. The Company may redeem the Senior notes at any time after
May 12, 2004 at $1,030 per $1,000 principal amount of Senior notes to be redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest. The holder(s) may require the Company to repurchase the
Senior notes upon a change in control of the Company. The Company pays interest in cash on
the Senior notes on the last business day of each March, June, September and December of
each year. Interest on the Senior notes is not deductible for tax purposes because of the
conversion feature.

The Company has a ten-year $960,000
loan from the State of Maryland under the Community Development Block Grant
(“CDBG”) program. Quarterly payments are due through December 2003 and represent
principal plus interest at 5 percent of the unamortized balance.

Concurrently, Skyworks USA entered into an agreement with Wachovia Bank, National
Association providing for a $50 million credit facility (“Facility Agreement”)
secured by the purchased accounts receivable. As a part of the consolidation, any interest
incurred by Skyworks USA related to monies it borrows under the Facility Agreement is

Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities consist of the tax effects of temporary differences related to the following
(in thousands):

Based upon a history of significant
operating losses, management has determined that it is more likely than not that historic
and current year income tax benefits will not be realized except for certain future
deductions associated with the Mexicali Operations in the post-Merger period.
Consequently, no United States income tax benefit has been recognized relating to the U.S.
operating losses. As of September 30, 2003, the Company has established a valuation
allowance against all of its net U.S. deferred tax assets. The net change in the valuation
allowance of $48.8 million is principally due to the generation of additional tax
attributes, i.e. federal and state net operating loss and credit carryovers, and other
intangibles associated with the Mexicali transaction. The future realization of certain
deferred assets will be applied to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. The portion of
the valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized
tax benefits will be applied to reduce goodwill related to the purchase consideration of
the Merger with Alpha is approximately $44 million. Deferred tax assets have been
recognized for foreign operations when management believes they will be recovered during
the carry-forward period. The Company does not expect to recognize any income tax benefits
relating to future operating losses generated in the United States until management
determines that such benefits are more likely than not to be realized. In 2002, the
Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $23 million related to the impairment of
its Mexicali assets. A valuation allowance has not been established because the Company
believes that the related deferred tax asset will be recovered during the carryforward
period.

As of September 30, 2003, the Company
has U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $164.5 million which
will expire at various dates through 2023 and aggregate state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $59.5 million which will expire at various dates through
2008. The Company also has U.S. federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $12.4 million. The U.S. federal tax credits expire at various dates through
2023. The use of the pre-Merger net operating loss and tax credit carryovers from Alpha
will be limited due to statutory tax restrictions resulting from the Merger and related
change in ownership. The annual limit on the utilization of pre-merger net operating
losses has been estimated at $14 million. Pre-Merger credits would also be subject to the
tax equivalent of the annual net operating loss limitation.

No provision has been made for United
States, state, or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately $3.8 million of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be
permanently reinvested. It is not practical to determine the United States federal income
tax liability, if any, which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently
reinvested.

As part of the spin-off and the
Merger, Washington, Conexant and Alpha entered into a tax allocation agreement which
provides, among other things, for the allocation between Conexant and the combined company
of certain tax liabilities relating to the Washington Business. In general, Conexant
assumed and is responsible for tax liabilities of the Washington Business and Washington
for periods prior to the Merger and the combined company has assumed and is responsible
for tax liabilities of the Washington Business for periods after the Merger. Subsequent to
the execution of the tax allocation agreement, and in connection with the refinancing
agreement and amended financing agreement with Conexant, we entered into a letter
agreement on November 6, 2002 with Conexant that amends the tax allocation agreement to
limit our indemnification obligations under the tax allocation agreement to a reduced set
of circumstances that could trigger such indemnification. However, the tax allocation
agreement continues to provide that we will be responsible for various other tax
obligations and for compliance with various representations and covenants made under the
tax allocation agreement.

NOTE 10.    
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Prior to the Merger with Alpha,
Conexant’s wireless business had no separate capitalization. The following
information represents the Company’s capital structure following the Merger.

COMMON STOCK

The Company is authorized to issue
(1) 525,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.25 per share, and (2) 25,000,000
shares of preferred stock, without par value.

Holders of the Company’s common
stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared by the Company’s board of
directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. Dividends may not be paid on
common stock unless all accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, have been paid or
declared and set aside. In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, the holders of common stock will be entitled to share pro rata in the assets
remaining after payment to creditors and after payment of the liquidation preference plus
any unpaid dividends to holders of any outstanding preferred stock.

Each holder of the Company’s
common stock is entitled to one vote for each such share outstanding in the holder’s
name. No holder of common stock is entitled to cumulate votes in voting for directors. The
Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that,
unless otherwise determined by the Company’s board of directors, no holder of common
stock has any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for any stock of any class which
the Company may issue or sell.

On August 11, 2003 the Company filed
a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) with respect to the issuance of up to $250 million aggregate principal
amount of securities, including debt securities, common or preferred shares, warrants or
any combination thereof. This registration statement, which the SEC declared effective on
August 28, 2003, provides the Company with greater flexibility and access to capital. On
September 9, 2003 the Company issued 9.2 million shares of common stock under its shelf
registration statement. The Company may from time to time issue securities under the
remaining balance of the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes.

At September 30, 2003, the Company
had 148,604,137 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

PREFERRED STOCK

The Company’s second amended and
restated certificate of incorporation permits the Company to issue up to 25,000,000 shares
of preferred stock in one or more series and with rights and preferences that may be fixed
or designated by the Company’s board of directors without any further action by the
Company’s stockholders. The designation, powers, preferences, rights and
qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the preferred stock of each series will be
fixed by the certificate of designation relating to such series, which will specify the
terms of the preferred stock.

At September 30, 2003, the Company
had no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.

STOCK OPTIONS

The Company has stock option plans under
which employees may be granted options to purchase common stock. Options are generally
granted with exercise prices at not less than the fair market value on the grant date,
generally vest over four years and expire ten years after the grant date. As of September
30, 2003, a total of 24.1 million shares are authorized for grant under the Company’s
long-term incentive plans. The number of common shares reserved for granting of future
awards was 14.2 million at September 30, 2003.

Pursuant to an exchange offer dated
June 16, 2003 (the “Exchange Offer”), the Company offered a stock option
exchange program to its employees, other than its executive officers under Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, giving them the right to tender
outstanding stock options with an exercise price of $13.00 per share or more in exchange
for new options to be issued six months and one day after the close of the Exchange Offer.
On July 3, 2003, the expiration date of the Company’s Exchange Offer, the Company
accepted for exchange from eligible employees options to purchase an aggregate of
5,328,085 shares of the Company’s common stock. These stock options were cancelled as
of that date. Pursuant to the Exchange Offer, a ratio was applied to the options accepted
for exchange from eligible employees and the Company expects that it will issue, on
January 5, 2004, new options to purchase approximately 3,428,881 shares of the
Company’s common stock with an exercise price at fair market value in exchange for
the options cancelled in connection with the offer. These new options will vest ratably
over an eighteen-month period. The Exchange Offer qualifies for fixed accounting and thus
the Company does not expect to recognize compensation expense in connection with the grant
of the replacement options pursuant to the Exchange Offer.

In connection with Conexant’s
spin-off of Washington, options to purchase shares of Conexant common stock were adjusted
so that immediately following the spin-off, option holders held options to purchase shares
of Conexant common stock and options to purchase Washington common stock. In connection
with the Merger, those options to purchase shares of Washington common stock were
converted into options to purchase the Company’s common stock, par value $0.25 per
share. The terms of options to purchase the Company’s common stock will be governed
by the Washington Sub, Inc. 2002 Stock Option Plan, which was assumed by Skyworks in the
Merger and which provides that such options will generally have the same terms and
conditions applicable to the original Conexant options. These options are included in the
following schedules and options related to non-employees are disclosed separately below.

As of September 30, 2003, the
Company’s ratio of options outstanding as a percentage of total common stock
outstanding (“overhang”) was 17.4%. The overhang attributable to options held by
non-employees (other than its non-employee directors) was 9.7% and the overhang
attributable to employees and directors was 7.7%.

In connection with the Merger, as of
September 30, 2003 and 2002 non-employees, excluding directors, held 14,351,737 and
18,184,701 options at a weighted average price of $16.76 and $20.49, respectively.
Effective June 25, 2002, in connection with the Merger each Conexant option holder, other
than holders of options granted to employees of Conexant’s former Mindspeed
Technologies segment on March 30, 2001 and options held by persons in certain foreign
locations, received an option to purchase an equal number of shares of common stock of the
Washington subsidiary. In the Merger, each outstanding Washington option was converted
into an option to purchase Skyworks common stock. The conversion of Washington options
into Skyworks’ options was done in such a manner that (1) the aggregate
intrinsic value of the options immediately before and after the conversion was the same,
(2) the ratio of the exercise price per option to the market value per option was not
reduced, and (3) the vesting provisions and options period of the Skyworks’
options were the same as the original vesting terms and option period of the corresponding
Washington options. As a result, there are a large number of options held by persons other
than Skyworks’ employees and directors. More specifically, non-employees hold a
greater number of options to purchase Skyworks’ common stock than do Skyworks’
employees.

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

The Company’s long-term
incentive plans provide for awards of restricted shares of common stock and other
stock-based incentive awards to officers and other employees and certain non-employees.
Restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates during the
prescribed retention period (generally within two years of the date of award) or, in
certain cases, if prescribed performance criteria are not met. The fair value of
restricted stock awards is charged to expense over the vesting period. There were no
restricted stock grants during fiscal years 2003 and 2002.

STOCK OPTION PLANS FOR
DIRECTORS

The Company has three stock option
plans for non-employee directors — the 1994 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, the 1997
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan and the Directors’ 2001 Stock Option Plan. Under the
three plans, a total of 826,000 shares have been authorized for option grants. The three
plans have substantially similar terms and conditions and are structured to provide
options to non-employee directors as follows: a new director receives a total of 45,000
options upon becoming a member of the Board; and continuing directors receive 15,000
options after each Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Under these plans, the option price is
the fair market value at the time the option is granted. Beginning in fiscal 2001, all
options granted become exercisable 25% per year beginning one year from the date of grant.
Options granted prior to fiscal 2001 become exercisable at a rate of 20% per year
beginning one year from the date of grant. During fiscal 2003, 114,000 options were
granted under these plans at a weighted average price of $6.66. At September 30, 2003, a
total of 627,000 options, net of cancellations, at a weighted average price of $13.84 have
been granted under these three plans and 301,500 shares were exercisable at a weighted
average price of $19.45. During fiscal 2003 and 2002, no options were exercised under
these plans. Non-employee directors of the Company are also eligible to receive option
grants under the Company’s 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE
PLAN

The Company maintains a domestic and
an international employee stock purchase plan. Under these plans, eligible employees may
purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of compensation. The price
per share is the lower of 85% of the market price at the beginning or end of each
six-month offering period. The plans provide for purchases by employees of up to an
aggregate of 1,880,000 shares through December 31, 2012. Shares of 704,921 and 65,668 were
purchased under these plans in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively.

STOCK WARRANTS

In connection with the Merger, the
Company issued to Jazz Semiconductor, Inc. (“Jazz Semiconductor”) a warrant to
purchase 1,017,900 shares of Skyworks common stock at a price of $24.02 per share. This
warrant became exercisable in increments of 25% as of June 25, 2002, March 11, 2003,
September 11, 2003 and March 11, 2004. The Company applied the Black-Scholes model to
determine the fair value estimate and approximately $0.8 million and $0.2 million was
included in amortization of intangible assets related to this item in fiscal 2003 and
2002, respectively. The warrant expires on January 20, 2005.

NOTE 11.     EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLAN

The Company maintains a 401(k) plan
covering substantially all of its employees. All of the Company’s employees who are
at least 21 years old are eligible to receive a Company contribution. Discretionary
Company contributions are determined by the Board of Directors and may be in the form of
cash or the Company’s stock. The Company contributes a match of 100% of the first 4%
of an employee’s annual salary. For fiscal years 2003 and 2002, the Company
contributed 560,516 and 128,836 shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock
valued at $4.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, to fund the Company’s
obligation under the 401(k) plan.

Conexant sponsored various benefit
plans for its eligible employees, including a 401(k) retirement savings plan, a retirement
medical plan and a pension plan. Expenses allocated from Conexant under these employee
benefit plans for Washington/Mexicali participants prior to the Merger were $1.0 million
and $1.3 million for fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively.

NOTE 12.     PENSIONS AND
OTHER RETIREE BENEFITS

In connection with Conexant’s
spin-off of its Washington/Mexicali business, Conexant transferred obligations to
Washington/Mexicali for its pension plan and retiree benefits. The amounts that were
transferred relate to approximately twenty Washington/Mexicali employees that had enrolled
in Conexant’s Voluntary Early Retirement Plan (“VERP”) in 1998. The VERP
also provides health care benefits to members of the plan. The Company currently does not
offer pension plans or retiree benefits to its employees.

September 30, 2003 and would not affect retirement medical expense. Consequently, a
decrease in the health care cost trend rate by 1% would decrease the accumulated
retirement medical obligation by $0.1 million at September 30, 2003 and would not affect
retirement medical expense.

NOTE 13.     COMMITMENTS

The Company has various operating
leases primarily for computer equipment and buildings. Rent expense amounted to $10.4
million, $7.1 million and $4.9 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 2001, respectively. Purchase
options may be exercised, at fair market value, at various times for some of these leases.

Under supply agreements entered into
with Conexant and subsequently with Jazz Semiconductor the Company receives wafer
fabrication, wafer probe and certain other services from Jazz Semiconductor’s Newport
Beach, California foundry.

Pursuant to the terms of these
agreements, the Company is committed to obtaining certain minimum wafer volumes from Jazz
Semiconductor. The Company’s expected minimum purchase obligations under these supply
agreements will be approximately $39 million and $13 million in fiscal 2004 and 2005,
respectively. The Company originally estimated its obligation under this agreement would
result in excess costs of approximately $12.9 million when recorded as a liability and
charged to cost of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2002, the Company reevaluated this obligation and reduced its liability and cost of
sales by approximately $8.1 million in the quarter. During the first quarter of fiscal
2003, the Company reevaluated the remaining $4.8 million obligation related to Jazz
Semiconductor and reduced its liability and cost of sales by approximately $4.8 million in
the quarter. The Company currently anticipates meeting each of the annual minimum purchase
obligations under these supply agreements.

NOTE 14.     CONTINGENCIES

From time to time various lawsuits,
claims and proceedings have been, and may in the future be, instituted or asserted against
Skyworks, including those pertaining to patent infringement, intellectual property,
environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment and contractual matters.
In addition, in connection with the Merger, Skyworks has assumed responsibility for all
then current and future litigation (including environmental and intellectual property
proceedings) against Conexant or its subsidiaries in respect of the operations of
Conexant’s wireless business. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to
Skyworks. Intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief which, if
imposed against Skyworks, could materially and adversely affect the financial condition or
results of operations of Skyworks.

Additionally, the semiconductor
industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property
rights. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert
patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that
are important to our business and have demanded and may in the future demand that we
license their technology. At the present time, the Company is in discussions with Qualcomm
Incorporated (“Qualcomm”) regarding claims that both the Company and Qualcomm
filed and first served against each other on December 4, 2003 asserting violations of
certain of each company’s respective intellectual property rights. The purpose of
these discussions is to arrive at a business resolution that avoids protracted litigation
for both parties. The Company believes Qualcomm’s claims are without merit and if the
Company is not successful resolving this matter outside of litigation, it is prepared to
vigorously defend against Qualcomm’s claims and fully prosecute its claims against
them.

NOTE 15.     GUARANTEES

The Company has made guarantees and
indemnities, under which it may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or
indemnified party, in relation to certain transactions. In connection with the Merger, the
Company assumed responsibility for all contingent liabilities and then-current and future
litigation (including environmental and intellectual property proceedings) against
Conexant or its subsidiaries to the extent related to the operations or assets of the
wireless business of Conexant. The Company may also be responsible for certain federal
income tax liabilities that relate to Washington/Mexicali’s spin-off from Conexant
under the Tax Allocation Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2002, between the Company and
Conexant, which provides that the Company will be responsible for certain taxes imposed on
Conexant or its shareholders. The Company’s obligations under the tax allocation
agreement have been limited by a letter dated November 6, 2002 entered into in connection
with the debt refinancing with Conexant.

In connection with the sales of its
products, the Company provides certain intellectual property indemnities to its customers.
In connection with certain facility leases, the Company has indemnified its lessors for
certain claims arising from the facility or the lease. The Company indemnifies its
directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of
Delaware. The duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies, and in many cases is
indefinite. The guarantees and indemnities to customers in connection with product sales
generally are subject to limits based upon the amount of the related product sales and in
many cases are subject to geographic and other restrictions. In certain instances, the
Company’s guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum
potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. The Company has not
recorded any liability for these guarantees and indemnities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

NOTE 16.     SPECIAL CHARGES

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003, the Company recorded a $26.0 million charge for the impairment of assets related to
certain infrastructure products manufactured in its Woburn, Massachusetts and Adamstown,
Maryland facilities. The Woburn facility primarily manufactures semiconductor products
based on both silicon wafer technology and gallium arsenide technology. The Company’s
Adamstown, Maryland facility primarily manufactures ceramics components. The Company
experienced a significant decline in factory utilization resulting from a downturn in the
market for products manufactured at these two facilities and a decision to discontinue
certain products. The impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis prepared by
management based on these factors and the related impact on its current and projected
outlook. The Company projected lower revenues and new order volume for these products and
management believed these factors indicated that the carrying value of the related assets
(machinery, equipment and intangible assets) may have been impaired and that an impairment
analysis should be performed. In performing the analysis for recoverability, management
estimated the future cash flows expected to result from these products over a five-year
period. Since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of
the related assets, it was concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized. In
accordance with SFAS No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” the impairment charge was determined by comparing the estimated fair value
of the related assets to their carrying value. The fair value of the assets was determined
by computing the present value of the estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of
16%, which management believed was commensurate with the underlying risks associated with
the projected future cash flows. Management believes the assumptions used in the
discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the
assets. The write down established a new cost basis for the impaired assets. The
anticipated pre-tax cost savings related to these impairment charges is expected to be
$17.4 million over the next five years (fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2008) and $8.6 million
over the subsequent fifteen years (fiscal 2009 through 2023).

In addition, during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 the Company recorded a $2.3 million charge for the impairment of
its Haverhill, Massachusetts property currently being held for sale. In fiscal 2003, the
Company relocated its operations from this facility to its Woburn, Massachusetts facility.
The Company is actively marketing the property located in Haverhill, Massachusetts.

During fiscal 2002, the Company
recorded a $66.0 million charge for the impairment of the assembly and test machinery and
equipment and related facility in Mexicali, Mexico. The impairment charge was based on a
recoverability analysis prepared by management as a result of a significant downturn in
the market for test and assembly services for non-wireless products and the related impact
on the Company’s current and projected outlook.

The Company experienced a severe
decline in factory utilization at its Mexicali facility for non-wireless products and
projected decreasing revenues and new order volume. Management believed these factors
indicated that the carrying value of the assembly and test machinery and equipment and
related facility may have been impaired and that an impairment analysis should be
performed. In performing the analysis for recoverability, management estimated the future
cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at the Mexicali facility
over a ten-year period. The estimated future cash flows were based on a gradual phase-out
of services sold to Conexant and modest volume increases consistent with management’s
view of the outlook for the business, partially offset by declining average selling
prices. The declines in average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and
management’s decision to reduce capital expenditures for future capacity expansion.
Since the estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value
(approximately $100 million based on historical cost) of the related assets, it was
concluded that an impairment loss should be recognized. The impairment charge was
determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying
value. The fair value of the assets was determined by computing the present value of the
estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 24%, which management believed was
commensurate with the underlying risks associated with the projected future cash flows.
Management believes the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a
reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets. The write down established a new cost
basis for the impaired assets.

During fiscal 2002, the Company
recorded a $45.8 million charge for the write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets
associated with its acquisition of Philsar Semiconductor Inc. (“Philsar”) in
fiscal 2000. Philsar was a developer of radio frequency semiconductor solutions for
personal wireless connectivity, including emerging standards such as Bluetooth, and radio
frequency components for third-generation digital cellular handsets. Management determined
that the Company would not support the technology associated with the Philsar Bluetooth
business. Accordingly, this product line was discontinued and the employees associated
with the product line were either severed or relocated to other operations. As a result of
the actions taken, management determined that the remaining goodwill and other intangible
assets associated with the Philsar acquisition were impaired.

During the third quarter of fiscal
2001, the Company recorded an $86.2 million charge for the impairment of the manufacturing
facility and related wafer fabrication machinery and equipment at the Company’s
Newbury Park, California facility. This impairment charge was based on a recoverability
analysis prepared by management as a result of the dramatic downturn in the market for
wireless communications products and the related impact on the then-current and projected
business outlook of the Company. Through the third quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company
experienced a severe decline in factory utilization at the Newbury Park wafer fabrication
facility and decreasing revenues, backlog, and new order volume. Management believed these
factors, together with its decision to significantly reduce future capital expenditures
for advanced process technologies and capacity beyond the then-current levels, indicated
that the value of the Newbury Park facility may have been impaired and that an impairment
analysis should be performed. In performing the analysis for recoverability, management
estimated the future cash flows expected to result from the manufacturing activities at
the Newbury Park facility over a ten-year period. The estimated future cash flows were
based on modest volume increases consistent with management’s view of the outlook for
the industry, partially offset by declining average selling prices. The declines in
average selling prices were consistent with historical trends and management’s
decision to focus on existing products based on the current technology. Since the
estimated undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value (approximately $106
million based on historical cost) of the related assets, it was concluded that an
impairment loss should be recognized. The impairment charge was determined by comparing
the estimated fair value of the related assets to their carrying value. The fair value of
the assets was determined by computing the present value of the estimated future cash
flows using a discount rate of 30%, which management believed was commensurate with the
underlying risks associated with the projected cash flows. The Company believes the
assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model represented a reasonable estimate of
the fair value of the assets. The write-down established a new cost basis for the impaired
assets.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

During the second and fourth quarters
of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded $3.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in
restructuring charges to provide for workforce reductions and the consolidation of
facilities. The charges were based upon estimates of the cost of severance benefits for
affected employees and lease cancellation, facility sales, and other costs related to the
consolidation of facilities. Substantially all amounts accrued for these actions are
expected to be paid within one year.

During fiscal 2002, the Company
implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to more closely align its cost
structure with the then-current business environment. The Company recorded restructuring
charges of approximately $3.0 million for costs related to the workforce reduction and the
consolidation of certain facilities. Substantially all amounts accrued for these actions
have been paid.

During fiscal 2001,
Washington/Mexicali reduced its workforce by approximately 250 employees, including
approximately 230 employees in manufacturing operations. Restructuring charges of $2.7
million were recorded for such actions and were based upon estimates of the cost of
severance benefits for the affected employees. The Company has paid all amounts accrued
for these actions.

Merger. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, payments related to the
restructuring reserves assumed from Alpha were $4.7 million and $1.1 million,
respectively. On September 30, 2003 this balance was $2.0 and primarily relates to
payments on a lease that expires in 2008.

NOTE 17.     SEGMENT
INFORMATION AND CONCENTRATIONS

The Company follows SFAS No. 131,
“Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.” SFAS No.
131 establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about
operating segments in annual financial statements and in interim reports to shareholders.
The method for determining what information to report is based on the way that management
organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing
financial performance. In evaluating financial performance, management uses sales and
operating profit as the measure of the segments’ profit or loss. Based on the
guidance in SFAS No. 131, the Company has one operating segment for financial reporting
purposes.

The Company operates in one business
segment, which designs, develops, manufactures and markets proprietary semiconductor
products and system solutions for manufacturers of wireless communication products.

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Net revenues by geographic area are
presented based upon the country of destination. Net revenues by geographic area are as
follows (in thousands):

The Company’s revenues by
geography do not necessarily correlate to end handset demand by region. For example, if
the Company sells a power amplifier module to a customer in South Korea, the sale is
recorded within the South Korea account although that customer, in turn, may integrate
that module into a product sold to a service provider (its customer) in Africa, China,
Europe, the Middle East, the Americas or within South Korea.

CONCENTRATIONS

Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of
trade accounts receivable. Trade receivables are primarily derived from sales to
manufacturers of communications and consumer products. Ongoing credit evaluations of
customers’ financial condition are performed and collateral, such as letters of
credit and bank guarantees, are required whenever deemed necessary. Samsung Electronics,
Co. accounted for 18% and 27% of the Company’s gross accounts receivable balances at
September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The
following customers accounted for 10% or more of net revenues:

26, 2002 through the end of the fiscal year and for fiscal 2003.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
               Assets,” on October 1, 2002 and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in
               accounting principle of $397.1 million, which is reflected in the above table as
               of the beginning of fiscal 2003.

(2)

Earnings per share calculations for each of the quarters are based on the
               weighted average number of shares outstanding and included common stock
               equivalents in each period. Therefore, the sums of the quarters do not
               necessarily equal the full year earnings per share. Prior to the Merger with
               Alpha Industries, Inc., Conexant’s wireless business had no separate
               capitalization, therefore a calculation cannot be performed for weighted average
               shares outstanding to then calculate earnings per share.

ITEM 9.     CHANGES IN AND
DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Alpha’s independent accountant
was KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) and Washington/Mexicali’s independent accountant was
Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte & Touche”). KPMG has continued to serve
as the Company’s independent accountant after consummation of the Merger. Because the
Merger is being accounted for as a reverse acquisition, the financial statements of
Washington/Mexicali constitute the financial statements of the Company as of the
consummation of the Merger. Therefore, upon the consummation of the Merger on June 25,
2002, there was a change in the independent accountant for the Company’s financial
statements from Deloitte & Touche to KPMG, and accordingly, Deloitte & Touche was
dismissed as the Company’s independent accountant.

The report of Deloitte & Touche
on Washington/Mexicali’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2001 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor was such report
qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The
decision to change accountants was approved by the Board of Directors.

During Washington/Mexicali’s
fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 and through the subsequent interim period to June 25,
2002, Washington/Mexicali did not have any disagreement with Deloitte & Touche on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or procedure that, if not resolved to Deloitte & Touche’s satisfaction,
would have caused Deloitte & Touche to make reference to the subject matter of the
disagreement in connection with its report. During that time, there were no
“reportable events” as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v)(A)-(D) of Regulation S-K
(“Regulation S-K”) adopted by the SEC.

KPMG (or its predecessors) has been
Alpha’s independent accountant since 1975 and Alpha has regularly consulted KPMG (or
its predecessors) since that time. Washington/Mexicali, as the continuing reporting entity
for accounting purposes, did not consult KPMG during Washington/Mexicali’s fiscal
year ended September 30, 2001 and through the interim period to June 25, 2002 regarding
any of the matters specified in Item 304(a)(2) of Regulation S-K.

ITEM 9A.     CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report (the “Evaluation
Date”). Based upon that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to the material information relating
to us (or our consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in our periodic SEC
filings. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

There were no significant changes
made in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2003 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

No further grants may be made under the Washington Sub Inc. 2002 Stock Option

                    directors).

1999 EMPLOYEE LONG-TERM
INCENTIVE PLAN

The purposes of the Company’s
1999 Employee Long-term Incentive Plan (the “1999 Employee Plan”) are (i) to
provide long-term incentives and rewards to those employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries, other than officers and non-employee directors, who are in a position to
contribute to the long-term success and growth of the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii)
to assist the Company in retaining and attracting employees with requisite experience and
ability, and (iii) to associate more closely the interests of such employees with those of
the Company’s stockholders. The 1999 Employee Plan provides for the grant of
non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The
term of these options may not exceed ten years. The 1999 Employee Plan contains provisions
which permit restrictions on vesting or transferability, as well as continued
exercisability upon a participant’s termination of employment with the Company, of
options granted thereunder. The 1999 Employee Plan provides for full acceleration of the
vesting of options granted thereunder upon a “change in control” of the Company,
as defined in the 1999 Employee Plan. The Board of Directors generally may amend, suspend
or terminate the 1999 Employee Plan in whole or in part at any time; provided that any
amendment which affects outstanding options be consented to by the holder of the options.

WASHINGTON SUB, INC.
2002 STOCK OPTION PLAN

The Washington Sub, Inc. 2002 Stock
Option Plan (the “Washington Sub Plan”) became effective on June 25, 2002 in
connection with the Merger. At the time of the spin-off of Conexant’s wireless
business, outstanding Conexant options granted pursuant to certain Conexant stock
incentive plans were converted so that following the spin-off and Merger each holder of
those certain Conexant options held (i) options to purchase shares of Conexant common
stock and (ii) options to purchase shares of Skyworks common stock. The purpose of the
Washington Sub Plan is to provide a means for the Company to perform its obligations with
respect to these converted stock options. The only participants in the Washington Sub Plan
are those persons who, at the time of the Merger, held outstanding options granted
pursuant to certain Conexant stock option plans. No further options to purchase shares of
Skyworks common stock will be granted under the Washington Sub Plan. The Washington Sub
Plan contains a number of sub-plans, which contain terms and conditions that are
applicable to certain portions of the options subject to the Washington Sub Plan,
depending upon the Conexant stock option plan from which the Skyworks options granted
under the Washington Sub Plan were derived. The outstanding options under the Washington
Sub Plan generally have the same terms and conditions as the original Conexant options
from which they are derived. Most of the sub-plans of the Washington Sub Plan contain
provisions related to the effect of a participant’s termination of employment with
the Company, if any, and/or with Conexant on options granted pursuant to such sub-plan.
Several of the sub-plans under the Washington Sub Plan contain specific provisions related
to a change in control of the Company.

NON-QUALIFIED ESPP

The Company also maintains a
Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan to provide employees of the Company and
participating subsidiaries with an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the
Company through the purchase, by means of payroll deductions, of shares of the
Company’s common stock at a discount from the market price of the common stock at the
time of purchase. The Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan is intended for use
primarily by employees of the Company located outside the United States. Under the plan,
eligible employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 10% of
compensation. The price per share is the lower of 85% of the market price at the beginning
or end of each six-month offering period.
