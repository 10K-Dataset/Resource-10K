            Caribbean,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and
            “us” refer to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the term "Pullmantur”
            refers to Pullmantur S.A. and the terms “Royal Caribbean International,”
            “Celebrity Cruises,” “Pullmantur Cruises,” “Azamara
            Cruises” and “CDF Croisières de France” refer to our cruise
            brands. In accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, the term
            “berths” is determined based on double occupancy per cabin even though many

Item 1. Business

General

Royal Caribbean International was founded in 1968. The current parent
            corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., was incorporated on July 23, 1985 in the
            Republic of Liberia under the Business Corporation Act of Liberia.

We are the world’s second largest cruise company operating 35
            ships in the cruise vacation industry with approximately 71,200 berths as of December
            31, 2007. We own five cruise brands, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises,
            Pullmantur Cruises, Azamara Cruises, and CDF Croisières de France. In addition,
            we have a 50% investment in a joint venture with TUI Travel PLC (“TUI
            Travel”), formerly First Choice Holidays PLC, which operates the brand Island
            Cruises. Our cruise brands primarily serve the contemporary, premium and deluxe
            segments of the cruise vacation industry, which also includes the budget and
            luxury segments. Our ships operate on a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on
            approximately 380 destinations. We compete principally on the basis of quality of
            ships, quality of service, variety of itineraries and price.

Historically, our primary focus has been to serve the North American
            cruise market through our two main global cruise brands, Royal Caribbean International
            and Celebrity Cruises. Throughout the years, we have expanded our focus to increase
            international passenger sourcing by opening offices in the United Kingdom, Germany,
            Norway, Italy, Spain, and, during 2007, in Singapore and China.

We recently further expanded our global base through our 2006
            acquisition of Pullmantur Cruises, which provides us with a brand to serve the cruise
            markets in Spain and Latin America. Our announced launch in September 2007 of CDF
            Croisières de France will provide us with a custom-tailored product targeted to
            the cruise market in France beginning in May 2008. In December 2007, we announced a
            joint venture with TUI AG which, subject to closing, will result in the formation of a
            German cruise line under the name of TUI Cruises.

In addition to increasing our international passenger sourcing, the
            launch of Azamara Cruises in 2007 provides us with a new global cruise brand designed
            to serve the emerging deluxe cruise segment between the premium and luxury segments,
            primarily in the North American cruise market. Our commitment to acquire
            state-of-the-art ships, along with our continuous maintenance programs and
            revitalizations to incorporate our current signature brand elements provides us with
            the flexibility to deploy our ships among our brand portfolio and expand into growing
            international markets.

Royal Caribbean International

Royal Caribbean International serves the contemporary and premium
            segments of the cruise vacation industry. The contemporary segment is served by cruises
            that are generally seven nights or shorter and feature a casual ambiance. The premium
            segment is served by cruises that are generally seven to 14 nights and appeal to the
            more experienced passenger who is usually more affluent. Royal Caribbean International
            operates 21 ships with approximately 51,500 berths, offering cruise itineraries that
            range from two to 18 nights. Royal Caribbean International offers a variety of
            itineraries to destinations worldwide, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, the
            Caribbean, Europe, Hawaii, Latin America and New Zealand.

Royal Caribbean International’s strategy is to attract an array of
            vacationing consumers in the contemporary segment by providing a wide variety of
            itineraries and cruise lengths with multiple innovative options for onboard dining,
            entertainment and other onboard activities. Royal Caribbean International offers a wide
            array of onboard services, amenities and activities, including swimming pools, sun
            decks, beauty salons, exercise and spa facilities, ice skating rinks, in-line skating,
            basketball courts, rock climbing walls, surf machines, bungee jumping trampolines,
            miniature golf courses, an interactive waterpark called the H2O Zone™, gaming
            facilities,


lounges, bars, Las Vegas-style entertainment, cinemas, and “Royal
            Promenades” which are boulevards with shopping, dining and entertainment venues.
            Additionally, Royal Caribbean International offers a variety of shore excursions at
            each port of call. We believe that the variety and quality of Royal Caribbean
            International’s product offerings represent excellent value to consumers,
            especially to couples and families traveling with children. Because of the
            brand’s extensive product offerings, we believe Royal Caribbean International is
            well positioned to attract new consumers to the cruise vacation industry and to
            continue to bring passengers back for their next vacation. While the brand is
            positioned at the upper end of the contemporary segment, we believe that Royal
            Caribbean International’s quality enables it to attract consumers from the
            premium segment as well, thereby achieving one of the broadest market coverages of any
            of the major brands in the cruise vacation industry.

Celebrity Cruises

Celebrity Cruises primarily serves the premium segment of the cruise
            vacation industry. Celebrity Cruises operates eight ships with approximately 13,800
            berths, offering various cruise itineraries that range from two to 16
            nights.

Celebrity Cruises’ strategy is to attract experienced cruise
            passengers who appreciate and value the high quality, service-focused experience the
            brand offers. Celebrity Cruises offers a global cruise experience by providing a
            variety of cruise lengths and itineraries to premium destinations throughout the world
            and by deploying a high proportion of its fleet in seasonal markets (i.e. Alaska,
            Australia, Bermuda, Europe, Hawaii, New Zealand, the Panama Canal and South America).
            Celebrity Cruises delivers an intimate experience onboard upscale ships that offer
            extensive spa facilities, fine dining, personalized service, and a high
            staff-to-passenger ratio. These are the hallmarks of the premium cruise vacation
            segment.

Pullmantur Cruises

In November 2006, we completed our acquisition of Pullmantur S.A., the
            largest cruise operator in Spain, which we currently operate as our Pullmantur Cruises
            brand. Pullmantur Cruises serves the contemporary segment of the Spanish and Latin
            American cruise markets. Pullmantur Cruises operates four ships with approximately
            4,500 berths, offering various seven-night cruise itineraries. In addition, Pullmantur
            Cruises has tour operations, and owns a minority interest in a small air business that
            operates two aircraft in support of its cruise and tour operations.

Pullmantur Cruises’ strategy is to attract cruise passengers by
            providing a variety of cruising options and land-based travel packages. Pullmantur
            Cruises offers a variety of cruise itineraries to the Caribbean, the Mediterranean and
            the Baltic. Pullmantur Cruises offers a wide variety of onboard activities and services
            to passengers, including exercise facilities, swimming pools, beauty salons, gaming
            facilities, and shopping, dining and entertainment venues. Pullmantur Cruises’
            tour operations sell land-based travel packages to Spanish guests including hotels and
            flights primarily to Caribbean resorts, and sells land-based tour packages to Europe
            aimed at Latin American guests.

In May 2007,

Zenith

was redeployed from Celebrity Cruises to Pullmantur Cruises. Before its
            redeployment to the Pullmantur Cruises brand,

Zenith

underwent extensive renovations to
            increase the number of cabins, verandas, enlarge public areas and customize the ship
            for Spanish and Latin American guests.

In May 2007, Pullmantur Cruises purchased the
            1,000-berth

Pacific Star

and will
            take possession of the ship in March 2008, at which time it will begin sailing under
            the name

Ocean Dream.

Currently, the
            ship is chartered under a bareboat charter to a third party.

Empress of the Seas

and

Sovereign of the Seas

will be redeployed
            from Royal Caribbean International to Pullmantur Cruises in March 2008 and November
            2008, respectively. Before redeployment to Pullmantur Cruises, each ship will undergo
            extensive renovations to incorporate Pullmantur Cruises’ signature
            elements.

Azamara Cruises

In May 2007, we introduced a new cruise brand, Azamara Cruises, designed
            to serve the emerging deluxe cruise segment between the premium and luxury segments of
            the North American cruise market. Azamara Cruises operates two ships with approximately
            1,400 berths, offering various cruise itineraries that range from ten to 24 nights and
            appeal to the more experienced passenger who is usually more affluent.


Azamara Cruises’ strategy is to attract experienced cruise
            passengers seeking a more intimate onboard experience, a high level of service and
            itineraries to a variety of unique destinations. Azamara Cruises currently offers
            itineraries to Bermuda, the Caribbean and the Panama Canal. Azamara Cruises will begin
            offering additional itineraries to Asia, Europe and South America in 2008. Azamara
            Cruises will also expand its itineraries with around-the-world voyages beginning in
            2010. Azamara Cruises offers a wide array of onboard services, amenities and
            activities, including gaming facilities, fine dining and interactive entertainment
            venues.

In May 2007,

            sailing under the name

Azamara
            Journey

. In September 2007,

. Before redeployment to the Azamara Cruises brand, each
            ship underwent extensive renovations to incorporate Azamara Cruises’ signature
            elements.

CDF Croisières de France

In September 2007, we launched a second new cruise brand, CDF
            Croisières de France. CDF Croisières de France is designed to serve the
            contemporary segment of the French cruise market and increases our global presence by
            providing us with a brand custom-tailored for French cruise guests. In April
            2008,

Holiday Dream

, a 750-berth
            ship, will be redeployed from Pullmantur Cruises to CDF Croisières de France to
            serve as its first ship and will sail under the name

            France

beginning in May 2008. Before redeployment to CDF
            Croisières de France,

Holiday Dream

will undergo extensive renovations to customize the ship for French
            guests.

CDF Croisières de France will offer seasonal seven-night
            itineraries to the Mediterranean and the Caribbean beginning in May 2008. CDF
            Croisières de France will offer a variety of onboard services, amenities and
            activities, including entertainment venues, exercise and spa facilities, fine dining,
            and gaming facilities.

Island Cruises

We have a joint venture with TUI Travel, one of the largest integrated
            tour operators in the United Kingdom. This joint venture operates Island Cruises, a
            cruise brand designed to serve the budget segment of the cruise vacation industry.
            Island Cruises offers itineraries designed to attract passengers from the United
            Kingdom and Brazil. Island Cruises operates a 1,500-berth ship sailing under the
            name

Island Escape

and a 1,350-berth
            ship sailing under the name

Island Star

which was formerly Celebrity Cruises’

Horizon

. Celebrity Cruises charters

Island Star

to Island Cruises under a
            six-year agreement through 2011.

Other

The Scholar Ship, our education program at sea for graduate and
            undergraduate students, commenced its first semester during the third quarter of 2007.
            The Scholar Ship operates a 29,000-ton ocean liner under a seasonal vessel operating
            lease agreement.

In December 2007, we entered into a joint venture agreement with TUI AG,
            a European tourism and shipping company which owns 51% of TUI Travel. The completion of
            the joint venture is contingent on obtaining regulatory/board approvals and other
            customary closing conditions. If concluded, the joint venture will operate a cruise
            brand, TUI Cruises, designed to serve the contemporary and premium segments of the
            German cruise market by offering a custom-tailored product for German cruise guests.
            TUI Cruises is scheduled to begin service with one ship in early 2009, and intends to
            expand with the delivery of two newly constructed ships in 2011 and 2012.


Industry

Cruising continues to represent a small but growing sector of the
            overall vacation market. Cruise lines compete with other vacation alternatives such as
            land-based resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for consumers’ leisure
            time. Demand for such activities is influenced by geo-political and general economic
            conditions. Industry data indicates that a significant portion of cruise passengers
            carried are first-time cruisers. We believe this presents an opportunity for growth and
            a potential for increased market share through the expansion of our fleet.

We estimate that the global cruise industry carried 16.6 million cruise
            passengers in 2007 compared to 15.3 million cruise passengers carried in 2006.
            According to our estimates, the global cruise market was served by an estimated 187
            ships with approximately 231,000 berths at the beginning of 2003. We estimate that this
            capacity increased to approximately 331,000 berths on approximately 229 ships by the
            end of 2007. There are approximately 38 ships with an estimated 98,000 berths that are
            expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market between 2008 and
            2011.

North America represents the primary source of our cruise passengers and
            has experienced a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8.5% since 1970. From
            2003 to 2007 North America has experienced a compound annual growth rate in cruise
            passengers of approximately 6.0%. We estimate that North America was served by 119
            ships with approximately 173,000 berths at the beginning of 2003 and by 148 ships with
            approximately 248,000 berths by the end of 2007. There are approximately 25 ships with
            an estimated 71,000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the North
            American cruise market between 2008 and 2011.

The following table details the growth in the global and North American
            cruise markets in terms of cruise passengers and estimated weighted-average berths over
            the past five years:

In response to experiencing more attractive pricing in certain markets
            outside North America, we have been redeploying some of the ships in our Royal
            Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises brands from the North American market to
            Europe, Latin America and Asia. This redeployment has contributed to an increase in the
            growth of our global cruise brands outside of the North American market.

We compete with a number of cruise lines; however, our principal
            competitors are Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns, among others, Carnival
            Cruise Lines, Princess Cruises, Costa Cruises, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises,
            Cunard Line and Aida Cruises; Star Cruises; NCL Corporation Ltd., which owns, among
            others, Norwegian Cruise Line; Mediterranean Shipping Company, which owns MSC Cruises;
            Disney Cruise Line; and Oceania Cruises.

Our ships operate worldwide and have itineraries that call on
            destinations in Alaska, Asia, Australia, the Bahamas, Bermuda, California, Canada, the
            Caribbean, Europe, the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, Mexico, New England, New Zealand, the
            Panama Canal and South America.


Operating Strategies

Our principal operating strategies are to:

• increase the awareness and market penetration of our
            brands,

• continue to expand our fleet with new state-of-the-art ships,
            while improving the quality and innovation of our existing fleet,

• expand into new markets and itineraries,

• continue to expand and diversify our passenger mix through
            international passenger sourcing,

• utilize sophisticated revenue management systems to optimize
            revenue from demand for our products,

• continue to improve our return on invested capital and the
            efficiency of our operating expenditures,

• further improve our technological capabilities, and

• maintain strong relationships with travel agencies, the principal
            industry distribution channel, while offering direct access for consumers.

Brand Awareness and Market Penetration

We continue to increase the recognition and market penetration of our
            brands among consumers. Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises are
            established global brands in the contemporary and premium segments of the cruise
            vacation industry. Pullmantur Cruises is a widely recognized brand in the Spanish and
            Latin American contemporary cruise markets. In May 2007, we introduced a new cruise
            brand, Azamara Cruises, designed to serve the emerging deluxe cruise segment. In
            September 2007, we launched a second new cruise brand, CDF Croisières de France,
            which will commence operations in May 2008 and is designed to serve the contemporary
            segment of the French cruise market.

We increase brand awareness and market penetration of our Royal
            Caribbean International brand through communication strategies designed to emphasize
            its high quality and excellent-value cruise vacations. Royal Caribbean
            International’s communication strategies target active adults and families who
            are vacation enthusiasts interested in exploring new destinations and seeking new
            experiences. These strategies are also designed to attract first-time cruisers to the
            cruise vacation industry and to the Royal Caribbean International brand. In order to
            attract the active cruiser who is seeking new experiences as well as first-time
            cruisers, Royal Caribbean International provides multiple choices to guests through a
            wide array of itineraries, accommodations, dining options, onboard activities and shore
            excursions. The hallmarks of the brand include friendly and engaging service,
            state-of-the-art ships, family programs, entertainment, health and fitness and
            energizing onboard and shoreside activities designed for guests of all ages.

We increase brand awareness and market penetration of our Celebrity
            Cruises brand through a series of consumer and trade campaigns designed to broaden the
            recognition of its high quality cruise vacations and drive loyalty and brand preference
            by emphasizing the personalized service and attention its guests receive. Celebrity
            Cruises’ communications target cruisers who seek upscale experiences and
            appreciate a high staff-to-passenger ratio, spacious accommodations, fine dining and
            spa services.

We increase brand awareness and market penetration of our Pullmantur
            Cruises brand primarily through advertising campaigns targeted to Spanish-speaking
            guests in both Spain and Latin America. All customer-facing crewmembers speak Spanish,
            and onboard activities, services, shore excursions and menu offerings are designed to
            suit the preferences of this target market.

We are currently increasing awareness and market penetration of our
            Azamara Cruises brand through trade education, public relations and direct
            communications, designed to target the emerging deluxe cruise segment of the North
            American cruise market. Azamara Cruises’ communications target experienced cruise
            passengers who prefer a more upscale, intimate and destination-focused cruise
            experience on smaller ships with longer itineraries.

We believe Azamara Cruises provides a more exclusive
            guest experience with its distinctive combination of personalized service, exceptional
            cuisine and exotic destinations, with unique excursions.


We will seek to increase the awareness and
            market penetration of our CDF Croisières de France brand through trade
            education, public relations and direct communications, designed to target the
            contemporary segment of the French cruise market. CDF Croisières de
            France’s communications will emphasize that its cruise product is tailored
            specifically to French-speaking guests. All customer-facing crewmembers will speak
            French, and the onboard activities and menu offerings are designed to suit their target
            guests’ preferences.

Fleet Expansion and Innovation

Our commitment to acquire state-of-the-art ships, along with our
            continuous maintenance programs and revitalizations to incorporate the current
            signature brand elements provides us with the flexibility to deploy our ships among our
            brand portfolio and expand into growing international markets. Since our first fleet
            expansion program in 1988, we have continued to increase our average ship size and
            number of available berths, which has enabled us to achieve certain economies of scale.
            Based on the ships currently on order, our capacity is expected to increase to
            approximately 97,000 berths by December 31, 2011.

In addition to expanding our fleet, we place a strong focus on product
            innovation to drive new demand for our products and stimulate repeat business from our
            guests. Innovation of our products is achieved by introducing new concepts on our new
            ships and continuously making improvements to our existing fleet. In order to offer
            guests a wider range of activities and amenities and to ensure consistency across our
            fleets, we also embarked on a program of revitalizing our older ships to update and
            refresh their interiors and to incorporate signature brand elements. Renovations
            included the addition of new balconies, verandas, dining and entertainment options, as
            well as extensive refurbishments to staterooms and public areas.

Royal Caribbean International.

Founded in
            1968, Royal Caribbean International was the first cruise line to design ships
            especially for warm water year-round cruising. Royal Caribbean International operated a
            modern fleet in the 1970s and early 1980s, establishing a reputation for high quality.
            Between 1988 and 1992, the brand tripled its capacity by embarking on its first major
            capital expansion program and taking delivery of three Sovereign-class ships. Each
            Sovereign-class ship is approximately 73,000 gross tons, ranging in size from
            approximately 2,300 to 2,350 berths. Royal Caribbean International began revitalizing
            its Sovereign-class ships in 2003 with extensive renovations to

Monarch of the Seas

, followed by

Sovereign of the Seas

in 2004 and

Majesty of the Seas

in early 2007. The
            extensive renovations to the Sovereign-class included the addition of new dining and
            entertainment options, the upgrade of guest suites and staterooms and the expansion of
            the day spa and fitness center.

In 1990, Royal Caribbean International took delivery of

Empress of the Seas

, and in 2004, Royal
            Caribbean International revitalized

Empress of the
            Seas

with extensive renovations including the addition of new
            dining and entertainment options, the upgrade of guest suites and staterooms and the
            expansion of the day spa and fitness center.

From 1995 through 1998, Royal Caribbean International took delivery of
            six Vision-class ships, ranging in size from approximately 1,800 to 2,000 berths. In
            2005, Royal Caribbean International revitalized and lengthened

Enchantment of the Seas

, with the addition
            of a new 73-foot midsection featuring 151 additional staterooms, the addition of new
            dining and entertainment options and the expansion of the day spa and fitness
            center.

From 1999 through 2003, Royal Caribbean International introduced its
            five Voyager-class ships. Each Voyager-class ship is approximately 140,000 gross tons
            with approximately 3,100 berths. The Voyager-class ships introduced several product
            innovations to the marketplace, including the cruise vacation industry’s first
            horizontal atrium, the “Royal Promenade” (which is four decks tall, longer
            than a football field and provides entertainment, shopping and dining experiences),
            recreational activities such as ice skating, in-line skating, rock climbing, miniature
            golf and full court basketball, enhanced staterooms, expanded dining venues and a
            variety of intimate spaces.

From 2001 through 2004, Royal Caribbean International introduced its
            four Radiance-class ships, a progression from the brand’s Vision-class ships.
            Each Radiance-class ship is approximately 90,000 gross tons with approximately 2,100
            berths. The Radiance-class ships incorporate many of the dining and entertainment
            options of the Voyager-class ships, as well as offer a wide array of unique features.
            These features include


panoramic glass elevators facing outward to the sea, floor to ceiling
            glass windows offering sea views and a billiards club featuring gyroscopic billiard
            tables. Royal Caribbean International has adopted the product innovations of the
            Voyager and Radiance-class ships as signature elements of the brand.

In 2006, Royal Caribbean International launched the 3,600-berth

Freedom of the Seas

, the first of three
            Freedom-class

ships, and the largest cruise ship in the world. The
            Freedom-class ships are approximately 16% larger than the Voyager-class ships and have
            some of the largest staterooms and balconies in the industry, flat screen televisions,
            cell phone services and other amenities. The launch of the Freedom-class ships also
            introduced several new experiences to cruising, including a surf machine and an
            interactive water park called the H2O
            Zone

TM

. Royal Caribbean
            International took delivery of a second Freedom-class ship,

Liberty of the Seas,

in April 2007 and a
            third Freedom-class ship,

Independence of the
            Seas

, is expected to enter service in the second quarter
            of 2008.

Building upon the innovations of the Voyager and Freedom-class ships,
            Royal Caribbean International will introduce a new class of ships in 2009. This new
            class of ships, referred to as Project Genesis, will be approximately 220,000 gross
            tons each with approximately 5,400 berths, which is 50% larger than the capacity on the
            Freedom-class ships. Royal Caribbean International entered into contracts with a
            shipyard to build two unnamed Project Genesis class ships, expected to enter service in
            the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2010, respectively. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

regarding
            shipyards.

Celebrity Cruises.

Celebrity Cruises was
            founded in 1990 and operated three ships between 1992 and 1995. Between 1995 and 1997,
            Celebrity Cruises began its first capital expansion program, adding three Century-class
            ships, which range in size from approximately 1,750 to 1,850 berths. During this time,
            Celebrity Cruises also disposed of one of its original three ships.

From 2000 through 2002, Celebrity Cruises took delivery of four
            Millennium-class ships. Each Millennium-class ship is approximately 90,000 gross tons
            with approximately 2,050 berths. The Millennium-class ships are a progression from the
            Century-class ships and elevated Celebrity Cruises’ position in the premium
            segment of the marketplace. The Millennium-class ships build on the brand’s
            primary strengths, including gourmet dining, spacious staterooms and suites with
            verandas and spa facilities featuring a large hydropool with neck massage, body jets
            and services including “acupuncture at sea”. On the Millennium-class ships,
            an entire deck is dedicated to health and fitness. To further enhance the onboard
            experience, Celebrity Cruises offers a more intimate setting in piano, champagne, and
            martini bars and lounges.

In 2004, Celebrity Cruises continued to expand its product offerings
            with the launch of

Celebrity

Xpedition

, a 100-berth ship that offers a
            more intimate experience onboard a smaller ship with sailings to the Galapagos
            Islands.

In 2006, in order to ensure consistency across the fleet and to
            incorporate many of the Millennium-class standards to one of its Century-class ships,
            Celebrity Cruises made extensive renovations to

Celebrity
            Century

by adding 314 new verandas, approximately 26
            additional suites and staterooms, and a new specialty restaurant.

From 2005 to 2007, Celebrity Cruises entered into contracts with a
            shipyard to build four Solstice-class ships. The Solstice-class ships are a new
            wide-body construction class of ships, and will be approximately 122,000 gross tons
            each with approximately 2,850 berths.

Celebrity
            Solstice,

Celebrity
            Equinox

,

Celebrity
            Eclipse

and an unnamed fourth ship are expected to enter
            service in the fourth quarter of 2008, the third quarter of 2009, the third
            quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2011, respectively. The Solstice-class ships
            will incorporate many new and improved design features, and will have larger staterooms
            averaging 215 square feet, which is larger than the average in the industry.
            Approximately 90% of the ships' staterooms will be outside and approximately 81% of the
            staterooms will have verandas.

Pullmantur Cruises.

Pullmantur Cruises was
            founded in 1971 and is the largest cruise operator in Spain. Pullmantur Cruises
            currently operates four ships which range in size from approximately 750 to 1,400
            berths. As a result of the acquisition of Pullmantur Cruises in November 2006, we have
            expanded our overall fleet by five ships and approximately 4,500 berths.

In May 2007, Pullmantur Cruises purchased the 1,000-berth

Pacific Star

and will take possession of
            the ship in March 2008, at which time the ship will begin sailing under the name

Ocean Dream

. The ship is currently
            chartered under a bareboat charter agreement to a third party.


In May 2007,

Zenith

was redeployed from Celebrity Cruises to Pullmantur Cruises. Before
            redeployment to Pullmantur Cruises,

Zenith

underwent renovations to incorporate Pullmantur Cruises’ signature
            elements, while adding approximately 38 new verandas and 25 staterooms.

Empress of the Seas

and

Sovereign of the Seas

will be redeployed
            from Royal Caribbean International to Pullmantur Cruises in March 2008 and November
            2008, respectively. Before redeployment to Pullmantur Cruises, each ship will undergo
            extensive renovations to incorporate Pullmantur Cruises’ signature
            elements.

Azamara Cruises.

In May 2007,

Blue Dream

was redeployed from Pullmantur
            Cruises to Azamara Cruises, and is sailing under the name

Azamara Journey

. In September 2007,

Blue Moon

was also redeployed from
            Pullmantur Cruises to Azamara Cruises and is sailing under the name

Azamara Quest

. Before redeployment to the
            Azamara Cruises brand, each ship underwent extensive renovations to incorporate Azamara
            Cruises’ signature elements, while upgrading guest suites and staterooms, and
            adding two new specialty restaurants.

CDF Croisières de France.

In April
            2008,

Holiday Dream

will be
            redeployed from Pullmantur Cruises to CDF Croisières de France and will sail as
            its first ship under the name

Bleu de France.

Before redeployment to CDF Croisières de France,

Holiday Dream

will undergo extensive
            renovations in April 2008, including the addition of a French bistro and a spa with a
            sea water center, to customize the ship for French guests.

New
            Markets and Itineraries

Our ships operate worldwide with a selection of itineraries that call on
            approximately 380 ports. New ships, including both newly constructed ships and those we
            acquire, allow us to expand into new markets and itineraries. Our brands have expanded
            their mix of itineraries, while strengthening our ability to penetrate the European,
            Latin American and Caribbean markets further.

In April 2007, Royal Caribbean International dedicated

Navigator of the Seas

to the United Kingdom
            cruise market, offering itineraries to the Mediterranean sailing directly from
            Southampton, United Kingdom. In May 2007, Royal Caribbean International’s

Voyager of the Seas

returned to Barcelona,
            Spain offering Mediterranean itineraries. In October 2007, Royal Caribbean
            International introduced the Vision-class ship,

Rhapsody of
            the Seas

, to Australia, New Zealand, the South Pacific and
            Singapore. In December 2007, Royal Caribbean International’s

Splendour of the Seas

began an itinerary in
            South America with emphasis on Brazil, and

Legend of the
            Seas

began an itinerary in the Caribbean departing from the
            Dominican Republic. Also in December 2007, Celebrity Cruises introduced

Celebrity Mercury

to Australia and New
            Zealand offering open-jaw sailings between Auckland and Sydney. The brands are now
            offering a wide variety of cruise tours from Asia, Australia, New Zealand and South
            America in order to provide vacationers with a broad range of product
            options.

In 2008, we will continue to focus on the acceleration of Royal
            Caribbean International’s and Celebrity Cruises’ strategic positioning as
            global cruise brands. In April 2008,

Independence of the
            Seas

will be introduced in the United Kingdom and will offer
            itineraries to the Mediterranean, Ireland and the Canary Islands beginning in May 2008.
            In April 2008,

Navigator of the Seas

will begin offering sailings out of Spain and Italy. In October
            2008,

Rhapsody of the Seas

will
            continue to expand itineraries into Australia and New
            Zealand

.

Celebrity Cruises will also
            expand itineraries into Australia and New Zealand with

Celebrity Millennium

beginning in
            November 2008. In December 2008,

Legend of the Seas

will begin offering sailings from Singapore and Shanghai, and

Radiance of the Seas

will begin offering an
            itinerary in South America with emphasis on Chile and Argentina. Also in December
            2008,

Enchantment of the Seas

will
            begin offering itineraries to the Southern Caribbean from Panama.

In an effort to secure desirable berthing facilities for our ships, and
            to provide new or enhanced cruise destinations for our guests, from time to time we
            assist or invest in the development or enhancement of certain port facilities and
            infrastructure, including mixed-use commercial properties, located in strategic ports
            of call. Generally, we collaborate with local, private or governmental entities by
            providing management and/or financial assistance and often enter into long-term port
            usage arrangements. In exchange for our involvement, we generally secure preferential
            berthing rights for our ships.


International Passengers

Passenger ticket revenues generated by sales originating in countries
            outside of North America were approximately 30%, 18%, and 15% of total passenger ticket
            revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The percentage of passengers sourced
            outside of North America was approximately 23% in 2007 compared to approximately 13% in
            2006 and approximately 12% in 2005. International passengers have grown from
            approximately 342,000 in 2003 to approximately 871,000 in 2007.

We sell and market our global brands, Royal Caribbean International,
            Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Cruises, to passengers outside of North America through
            our offices in the United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, Italy, Spain, Singapore and China.
            We further extend our reach with a network of 48 independent international
            representatives located throughout the world. Historically, our focus has been to
            primarily source our passengers for our global brands from North America. Currently, we
            are expanding our focus to sell and market our cruise brands to countries outside of
            North America through fleet innovation and by responding to cultural characteristics of
            our global passengers.

In addition to expanding our international passenger sourcing for our
            global cruise brands, we are focused on increasing our local presence in markets
            outside of North America by acquiring and developing brands specifically designed to
            provide custom-tailored products. We have a 50% investment in a joint venture with TUI
            Travel, one of the largest integrated tour operators in the United Kingdom. This joint
            venture operates a cruise brand, Island Cruises, designed to serve the budget segment
            of the cruise vacation industry with a seasonal product specifically tailored to guests
            in the United Kingdom and Brazil during their summer seasons. In November 2006, we
            acquired the Pullmantur Cruises brand, which sells and markets its cruises to guests
            primarily in Spain and Latin America. In September 2007, we launched CDF
            Croisières de France, designed to sell and market its product designed for
            guests primarily in France. In December 2007, we entered into a joint venture agreement
            with TUI AG, a European tourism and shipping company that owns 51% of TUI Travel. The
            completion of the joint venture is contingent on obtaining regulatory/board approvals
            and other customary closing conditions. If concluded, the joint venture will operate a
            cruise brand, TUI Cruises, designed to serve the contemporary and premium segments of
            the German cruise market by offering a custom-tailored product for German cruise
            guests.

Revenue Management

We believe we have one of the most advanced revenue management systems
            in the industry, which enables us to make more advantageous decisions about pricing,
            inventory management and marketing actions. We are continuously working to improve
            these systems and tools through increased forecasting capabilities, ongoing
            improvements to our understanding of price/demand relationships, and greater automation
            of the decision process.

Return on Invested Capital and Efficiency of Operating
            Expenditures

We continue to foster a corporate culture focused on the ongoing
            improvement of our return on invested capital and the efficiency of operating
            expenditures by prioritizing the identification and implementation of shipboard and
            shoreside cost management initiatives. We are committed to pursuing our cost management
            initiatives while still making ongoing innovations to our fleet. We are focused on
            directing our capital expenditures to investments which will provide a desirable
            return. Our ongoing efforts to maintain a cost management focus include the
            optimization of shipboard and shoreside staffing levels, and improved efficiency of
            fuel consumption through technology and other initiatives such as the installation of
            diesel engines on our eight gas turbine ships. We continue to pursue a number of other
            opportunistic initiatives, including the use of alternative fuel solutions, itinerary
            optimization, and diligent shipboard conservation efforts.

Technological Capabilities

We continue to invest in information technology to support and improve
            our corporate infrastructure and guest and travel trade relations. In addition to
            introducing Pullmantur Cruises, Azamara Cruises and CDF Croisières de France to
            the existing reservations infrastructure, we have focused heavily on building tools
            that make it easy for our trade partners to do business with us. During 2007, we
            completed phase one of a multi-year investment to re-launch the online trade booking
            tool,

CruiseMatch®

, which allows
            travel agents direct access to Royal Caribbean International’s, Celebrity
            Cruises’, Pullmantur Cruises’ and Azamara Cruises’ computer
            reservation systems. The new

CruiseMatch®

now offers industry-leading functionality for
            individual,  group


and
            cruisetour bookings from a web-based tool on

cruisingpower.com

. We have also continued
            to build enhancements to all of our trade and guest Internet sites providing updated
            tools in support of all our products and services in both our existing and new markets.
            Most significantly, we offer our guests the ability to book and pay for shore
            excursions on our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Cruises
            Internet sites. We have plans to continue to evolve this capability over the next year
            by adding advanced reservation capability for a wider variety of onboard amenities such
            as specialty dining reservations.

We have a range of systems that support our supply chain to the global
            ports that we serve, including automation in support of our warehouses as well as
            onboard technical purchasing. We continue to evolve our onboard systems to offer new
            features to our guests and provide better support for managing our shipboard employees
            worldwide.

To better align our vacations to our guests’ needs, we have built
            and deployed a range of new customer relationship management tools which improve our
            ability to respond to passenger and travel agent inquiries in a timely and accurate
            manner. Additionally, to help us reward our frequent guests and drive continued loyalty
            to our brands, we have deployed a host of new tools that better support our customer
            loyalty programs, the “Crown & Anchor Society” and “Captain's
            Club”.

Travel Agency Support and Direct Business

Travel agencies generate the majority of bookings for our ships. We are
            committed to further developing and strengthening this very important distribution
            channel. Our sales teams focus on the unique qualities of each brand and provide
            support to the travel agency community. The Trade Support & Service department,
            with branded call center operations, further supports the travel agency community in
            designing the cruise vacation experience.

Cruisingpower.com

continues to be an
            industry-leading website exclusive to the travel agency community. In 2007, the website
            launched a number of new online tools designed to increase travel agent
            productivity.

VIP CruisePass

is a
            desktop alert designed to give travel agents alerts to special offers, weather
            updates, itinerary changes and latest news.

EMarketing

provides travel agents with a
            personalized link that directs customers to a video magazine or cruise planner
            interactive experience.

EConnect

is
            an online quoting tool that enables travel agents to send up to five online quotes to
            their database with real-time pricing and web-based functionality. In addition, Royal
            Caribbean International launched its first online training certification program,
            “University of Wow,” where travel agents can achieve up to an expert-level
            certification.

In 2007, we completed phase one of a multi-year investment to re-launch
            the online trade booking tool,

CruiseMatch®.

Travel agents nationwide participated in trainings in how to use the new
            tools offered by

CruiseMatch®

.
            The second phase of this investment will be launched in the first quarter of 2008 to
            offer additional functionality such as enabling travel agents to accept bookings in an
            existing group block, as well as group insurance. Pullmantur Cruises and Azamara
            Cruises were also incorporated into the online tool in 2007.

We have customer service representatives that are trained to assist
            travel agents in providing a higher level of service and

Insight

, the first Internet service tool of
            its kind in the industry, which assists agencies with productivity and enhances
            customer service. We currently operate reservation call centers to support our travel
            agent community in the United States, Canada, France, Spain and the United Kingdom
            offering flexibility and extended hours of operations. Call centers for the United
            States and Canada are located in Miramar, Florida, Wichita, Kansas and Springfield,
            Oregon. The call center for the United Kingdom is located in Addlestone, England. The
            call center for Pullmantur Cruises is located in Madrid, Spain. The call center for CDF
            Croisières de France is located in Paris, France.

We have certified vacation planners in our call centers in Miramar,
            Wichita and Addlestone offering cruise planning expertise and personal attention for
            direct bookings. In addition, direct booking channels for Royal Caribbean
            International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Cruises are available through our Internet
            sites at

www.royalcaribbean.com

,

www.celebrity.com

and

www.azamaracruises.com.

We continue to
            experience an increase in the use of our Internet sites and other direct booking
            channels as a source of our overall bookings.

Passenger Services

We offer to handle virtually all travel aspects related to passenger
            reservations and transportation, including arranging passenger pre- and post-hotel stay
            arrangements and air transportation. Our air/sea program offers passengers the choice
            of our standard air or custom air programs. Our standard air program allows our
            passengers to benefit from comprehensive relationships that we maintain with many major
            airlines ranging from fare negotiation and space handling

to baggage
            transfer. Our custom air program enables passengers to customize their flight
            arrangements, including selection of airline, specific flights and class of
            service.


The Royal Caribbean International passenger loyalty program, Crown &
            Anchor Society, has over 4.5 million members worldwide and includes benefits such as a
            secured dedicated section in the

www.royalcaribbean.com

Internet site with
            special cruise offers and onboard amenities. The Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Cruises
            passenger loyalty program, Captain's Club, has over 950,000 members. Captain's Club
            members enjoy exclusive members-only onboard programs and amenities, and are provided
            with a secured area on the Celebrity Cruises web site, which communicates select
            product offers.

Operations

Cruise Ships and Itineraries

As of December 31, 2007, we operate 35 ships under four cruise brands,
            with a selection of worldwide itineraries ranging from two to 24 nights that call on
            approximately 380 destinations. Our fifth cruise brand, CDF Croisières de
            France, will commence operations in May 2008.

Independence of
            the Seas

and

Celebrity
            Solstice

are expected to enter revenue service in May 2008
            and December 2008, respectively. In May 2007, Pullmantur Cruises purchased

Pacific Star

and will take possession of
            the ship in March 2008, at which time the ship will begin sailing under the name

Ocean Dream

as part of the Pullmantur
            Cruises brand. The ship is currently chartered under a bareboat charter agreement to a
            third party. The following table represents summary information concerning our ships
            and their areas of operation based on 2008 itineraries (subject to change):



The year a ship entered service
            refers to the year in which the ship commenced cruise revenue operations for each
            respective brand, which
                       is the same

as the year the ship was built, unless otherwise noted.


Empress of the Seas

and

Sovereign of the Seas

will be redeployed from Royal Caribbean International to
            Pullmantur Cruises in March

2008 and November
            2008,  respectively

            Azamara Cruises in September
                       2007.

Celebrity Cruises’

Horizon

, a 1,350 berth ship, was built in
            1990 and is currently chartered under a six-year agreement through 2011 to Island
            Cruises, our joint venture with TUI Travel. In addition, Pullmantur Cruises
            operated

Pacific

and

Mona Lisa

under seasonal time charter
            agreements with third parties from April through October 2007 and from June through
            August 2007, respectively.

We have one Freedom-class ship and two ships of a new Project Genesis
            class on order for Royal Caribbean International. These ships are being built in
            Finland by Aker Yards Oy. We have four Solstice-class ships on order for Celebrity
            Cruises. These ships are being built in Germany by Meyer Werft. See Item 1A.

Risk Factors

regarding shipyards. The
            expected dates ships enter service and planned berths of the seven ships on order are
            as follows:


Recently we
            reached an agreement with Meyer Werft to build a fifth Solstice-class ship for
            Celebrity Cruises, subject to certain conditions, for an additional capacity of
            approximately 2,850 berths, expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of
            2012.

Seasonality

Our revenues are seasonal based on the demand for cruises. Demand is
            strongest for cruises during the North American summer months and holidays.

Cruise Pricing

Our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of
            activities and amenities, including meals and entertainment. Prices vary depending on
            the destination, cruise length, cabin category selected and the time of year the cruise
            takes place. Although we grant credit terms to certain travel agencies and tour
            operators outside of North America, our payment terms generally require an upfront
            deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to the sailing. During the
            selling period of a cruise, we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices
            for available passenger cabins based on demand, with the objective of maximizing net
            yields. Historically, we have opened cruises for sale at least one year in advance, and
            often as much as two years in advance. Additionally, we offer air transportation as a
            service for guests that elect to utilize our transportation program. Our air
            transportation program is available from major cities in the United States and Canada,
            and from select cities in Europe, mainly in the United Kingdom. Prices vary by gateway
            and destination. Generally, air tickets are sold to guests at prices close to
            cost.

Onboard Activities and Other Revenues

Our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard
            services, amenities and activities, including swimming pools, sun decks, spa facilities
            (which include massage and exercise facilities), beauty salons, bungee jumping
            trampolines, gaming facilities, lounges, bars, Las Vegas-style entertainment, retail
            shopping, libraries, cinemas, conference centers, Internet cafes and shore excursions
            at each port of call. Royal Caribbean International offers rock climbing walls on its
            ships, additional activities including ice skating rinks and in-line skating on its
            Voyager-class ships and a surf machine and an interactive water park called the H2O
            Zone™ on its Freedom-class ships. While many onboard activities are included in
            the base price of a cruise, we realize additional revenues from, among other things,
            gaming, the sale of alcoholic and other beverages, gift shop items, shore excursions,
            photography, spa services and art auctions. Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity
            Cruises and Azamara Cruises offer enhanced functionality on our Internet sites for
            selecting shore excursions and amenities prior to embarkation. Royal Caribbean
            International and Celebrity Cruises also offer a catalogue gift service, which is now
            offered via the Internet to provide travel agents and others the opportunity to
            purchase gifts for guests.

In conjunction with our cruise vacations, we offer pre- and post-cruise
            hotel packages to our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara
            Cruises passengers. We also offer escorted, premium land-tour packages in Alaska, Asia,
            Australia, the Canadian Rockies, Europe, New Zealand and Latin America. These escorted,
            premium land-tour packages are offered exclusively in conjunction with our cruises
            marketed to our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Cruises
            passengers through our tour operations, Royal Celebrity Tours. Pullmantur Cruises also
            offers land-based tour packages to Spanish and European vacation travelers including
            hotels and flights to Caribbean resorts and sells land based packages to Europe aimed
            at Latin American guests. In addition, we sell cruise vacation protection coverage,
            which provides passengers with coverage for trip cancellation, medical protection and
            baggage protection.


Segment Reporting

We operate four cruise brands, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity
            Cruises, Pullmantur Cruises, and Azamara Cruises, and launched a new brand, CDF
            Croisières de France, which will commence operations in May 2008. The brands
            have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their
            economic characteristics as well as products and services provided. (For financial
            information see Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary
            Data

.)

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we employed approximately 4,461 full-time and
            607 part-time employees worldwide in our shoreside operations. We also employed
            approximately 41,475 shipboard employees. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 80% of
            our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe
            that our relationship with our employees is good.

Insurance

We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, which
            includes additional coverage for disbursements, earnings and increased value, which are
            maintained in amounts related to the value of each ship. The coverage for each of the
            hull policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the British,
            Scandinavian, French, United States and other international insurance
            markets.

We maintain liability protection and indemnity insurance for each of our
            ships through either Assuranceforeningen GARD, the United Kingdom Mutual Steam Ship
            Assurance Association (Bermuda) Limited, Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association
            (Bermuda) Limited or Assuranceforeningen SKULD.

We maintain war risk insurance for our ships, including terrorist risk
            insurance, on each ship through a Norwegian war risk insurance organization. This
            coverage includes coverage for physical damage to the ship which is not covered under
            the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies. We also
            maintain protection and indemnity war risk coverage for risks that would be excluded by
            the rules of the indemnity insurance organizations, subject to certain limitations.
            Consistent with most marine war risk policies, under the terms of our war risk
            insurance coverage, underwriters can give seven days notice to us that the policy will
            be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates.

We also maintain a form of business interruption insurance for our ships
            with our insurance underwriters in the event that a ship is unable to operate during
            scheduled cruise periods due to loss or damage to the ship arising from certain covered
            events that last more than a specified period of time. We also maintain insurance
            coverage for certain events, which would result in a delayed delivery of our contracted
            new ships, which we normally place starting approximately two years prior to the
            scheduled delivery dates.

Insurance coverage for shoreside property, shipboard inventory, and
            general liability risks are maintained with insurance underwriters in the United States
            and the United Kingdom. We have decided not to carry business interruption insurance
            for shoreside operations based on our evaluation of the risks involved and our
            protective measures already in place, as compared to the premium expense.

All insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and
            deductible levels. In addition, in certain circumstances, we co-insure a portion of
            these risks. Premiums charged by insurance carriers, including carriers in the maritime
            insurance industry, increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in
            nature. These cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses
            incurred in direct and reinsurance markets. We historically have been able to obtain
            insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially
            acceptable. No assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will
            be available to us in the future, particularly for war risk insurance.

The Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their
            Luggage by Sea (1974) and the 1976 Protocol to the Athens Convention are generally
            applicable to passenger ships. The United States has not ratified the Athens
            Convention; however, with limited exceptions, the 1976 Athens Convention Protocol may
            be contractually enforced with respect to those of our cruises that do not call at a
            United States port. The International Maritime Organization Diplomatic Conference
            agreed upon a new Protocol to the Athens


Convention on November 1, 2002. The 2002 Protocol, which is not
            yet in force, substantially increases the level of compulsory insurance, which must be
            maintained by passenger ship operators. No assurance can be given as to if or when the
            2002 Protocol will come into force. If in force, no assurance can be given that
            affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to provide the level of
            coverage required under the 2002 Protocol.

Trademarks

We own a number of registered trademarks related to the Royal Caribbean
            International, Celebrity Cruises, Pullmantur Cruises and CDF Croisières de
            France cruise brands and have filed applications to register trademarks related to the
            Azamara Cruises brand. The registered trademarks include the name “Royal
            Caribbean” and its crown and anchor logo, the name “Celebrity
            Cruises” and its “X” logo, the names “Pullmantur Cruises”
            and “Pullmantur”, the name “CDF Croisières de France”
            and the names of various cruise ships. We believe trademarks related to the Royal
            Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Pullmantur Cruises brands are widely
            recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. We also believe trademarks
            related to our new brands, Azamara Cruises and CDF Croisières de France, will be
            widely recognized throughout the world and will have considerable value.

Regulation

Our ships are regulated by various international, national, state and
            local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they
            operate. In addition, our ships are registered in the Bahamas, Malta or in the case
            of

Celebrity Xpedition

, Ecuador.
            Each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry, including
            regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of the ship
            and its passengers. Each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify
            compliance with these regulations. Ships operating out of United States ports are
            subject to inspection by the United States Coast Guard for compliance with
            international treaties and by the United States Public Health Service for sanitary
            conditions. Our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and
            regulations of various other countries our ships visit.

Our ships are required to comply with international safety standards
            defined in the Safety of Life at Sea Convention. The Safety of Life at Sea Convention
            standards are revised from time to time and the most recent modifications are being
            phased in through 2010. We do not anticipate that we will be required to make any
            material expenditures in order to comply with these rules.

We are required to obtain certificates from the United States Federal
            Maritime Commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of
            non-performance of obligations to passengers, as well as casualty and personal injury.
            Pursuant to the United States Federal Maritime Commission regulations, we arrange
            through our insurers for the provision of guarantees aggregating $45.0 million for our
            ship-operating companies as a condition to obtaining the required certificates. The
            United States Federal Maritime Commission has proposed various revisions to the
            financial responsibility regulations, which could require us to significantly increase
            the amount of our bonds and accordingly increase our costs of compliance.

We are also required by the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions to
            establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the
            non-performance of our obligations to passengers from these jurisdictions. In the
            United Kingdom, we are currently required by the United Kingdom Passenger Shipping
            Association and United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority to provide performance bonds
            totaling approximately £55.4 million. The United Kingdom law has recently been
            changed effective April 1, 2008, such that we will no longer be required by the United
            Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority to provide such performance bonds. The impact of this
            change is that the total value of our performance bonds provided in the United Kingdom
            will be reduced to approximately £34.4 million as of that date. Beginning April
            1, 2008 and thereafter, we will be required to pay to the United Kingdom Civil Aviation
            Authority a non-refundable tax of £1 per passenger. This change will not have a
            material impact on our 2008 results of operations.

We are subject to various United States and international laws and
            regulations relating to environmental protection. Under such laws and regulations, we
            are prohibited from, among other things, discharging certain materials, such as
            petrochemicals and plastics, into the waterways. We have made, and will continue to
            make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations.
            From time to time, environmental and other regulators consider more stringent
            regulations, which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs. We
            believe that

the impact of cruise ships on the global environment will
            continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and,
            accordingly, this will likely subject us to increasing compliance costs in the
            future.


Our ships are subject to the United States Passenger Vessel Services Act
            (“PVSA”) which restricts US coast-wise trading by foreign-flagged cruise
            ships. In November 2007, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”)
            proposed an interpretive rule to the PVSA which would require that all roundtrip U.S.
            cruises by foreign flag vessels spend at least 48 hours in each foreign port of the
            cruise and that the time spent in foreign ports must be more than 50% of the time spent
            in all U.S. ports on the cruise. We believe that the CBP issued the proposed rule to
            protect Norwegian Cruise Line's operations in Hawaii by making it more difficult
            for foreign-flagged ships to conduct cruises going to Hawaii. However, if the rule is
            adopted as proposed, it could have an impact on other non-Hawaii itineraries
            such as Seattle-based Alaska and some Caribbean cruises, which may no longer qualify
            under the PVSA. If this were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our financial
            condition and results of operations.

We are required to obtain certificates from the United States Coast
            Guard relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of water pollution.
            Pursuant to United States Coast Guard regulations, we arrange through our insurers for
            the provision of guarantees aggregating $318.0 million as a condition to obtaining the
            required certificates.

We believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations
            applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our
            business. Health, safety, security and financial responsibility issues are, and we
            believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in
            the United States and internationally. From time to time, various regulatory and
            legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and would likely
            subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future.

Taxation of the Company

United States Federal Income Tax

The following discussion of the application of the United States federal
            income tax laws to us and our subsidiaries is based on the current provisions of the
            United States Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Department regulations, administrative
            rulings, and court decisions. All of the foregoing is subject to change, and any such
            change could affect the accuracy of this discussion.

Application of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue
            Code

We and our subsidiary, Celebrity Cruises Inc., the operator of Celebrity
            Cruises and Azamara Cruises, are foreign corporations engaged in a trade or business in
            the United States, and our ship-owning subsidiaries are foreign corporations that, in
            many cases, depending upon the itineraries of their ships, receive income from sources
            within the United States. Under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain
            foreign corporations are not subject to United States income or branch profits tax on
            United States source income derived from or incidental to the international operation
            of a ship or ships, including income from the leasing of such ships.

A foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if,
            in relevant part: (1) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized
            grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States; and
            (2)(A) more than 50% of the value of the corporation’s capital stock is owned,
            directly or indirectly, by individuals who are residents of a foreign country that
            grants such an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States, or
            (B) the stock of the corporation (or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof)
            is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in
            the United States or another qualifying country such as Norway. In the opinion of our
            United States tax counsel, Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, based on the representations
            and assumptions set forth in that opinion, we, Celebrity Cruises Inc. and our
            ship-owning subsidiaries qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because we and each of
            those subsidiaries are incorporated in Liberia or Malta, which are qualifying
            countries, and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established
            securities market in the United States or Norway. If, in the future, Liberia no longer
            qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction or Royal Caribbean failed to qualify
            as a publicly traded corporation, it and all of its ship-owning or operating
            subsidiaries that rely on Section 883 for tax exemption on qualifying income would be
            subject to United States federal income tax on their United States source shipping
            income and income from activities incidental thereto.


We believe that most of our income and the income of our ship-owning
            subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or
            ships and, therefore, is exempt from taxation under Section 883. In 2005, final
            regulations became effective under Section 883, which, among other things, narrow
            somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the Internal Revenue Service to
            be incidental to the international operation of ships. The activities listed in the
            regulations as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include
            income from the sale of air and land transportation, shore excursions and pre and post
            cruise tours. To the extent the income from these activities is earned from sources
            within the United States, that income will be subject to United States taxation; but
            the determination of the precise amount of such United States source income involves
            some uncertainties.

Under certain circumstances, changes in the identity, residence or
            holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders could cause our common stock not to be
            “regularly traded on an established securities market” within the meaning
            of the regulations under Section 883. To substantially reduce any such risk, in May
            2000, our Articles of Incorporation were amended to prohibit any person, other than our
            two existing largest shareholders, from owning, directly or constructively as
            determined for purposes of Section 883(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and the
            regulations promulgated under it, more than 4.9% of the relevant class or classes of
            our shares. Under Liberian law, this amendment may not be enforceable with respect to
            shares of common stock that were voted against the amendment or that were recorded as
            abstaining from the vote.

Also, it should be noted that Section 883 has been the subject of
            legislative modifications in past years that have had the effect of limiting its
            availability to certain taxpayers, and there can be no assurance that future
            legislation will not preclude us from obtaining the benefits of Section 883.

Taxation in the Absence of an Exemption under Section 883 of the
            Internal Revenue Code

If we, Celebrity Cruises Inc., or our ship-owning subsidiaries were to
            fail to meet the requirements of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, or if the
            provision was repealed, then, as explained below, such companies would be subject to
            United States income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental
            to the international operation of our ships.

Because we and Celebrity Cruises Inc. conduct a trade or business in the
            United States, we and Celebrity Cruises Inc. would be taxable at regular corporate
            rates on our separate company taxable income (i.e., without regard to the income of our
            ship-owning subsidiaries), from United States sources, which includes 100% of income,
            if any, from transportation that begins and ends in the United States (not including
            possessions of the United States), 50% of income from transportation that either begins
            or ends in the United States, and no income from transportation that neither begins nor
            ends in the United States. The legislative history of the transportation income source
            rules suggests that a cruise that begins and ends in a United States port, but that
            calls on more than one foreign port, will derive United States source income only from
            the first and last legs of such cruise. This conclusion is not free from doubt,
            however, because there are no regulations or other Internal Revenue Service
            interpretations of the above rules. In addition, if any of our earnings and profits
            effectively connected with our United States trade or business were withdrawn, or were
            deemed to have been withdrawn, from our United States trade or business, those
            withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of
            30%. The amount of such earnings and profits would be equal to the aforesaid United
            States source income, with certain generally minor adjustments, less income taxes. We
            and Celebrity Cruises Inc. would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of
            certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30%.

If Section 883 were not available to our ship-owning subsidiaries, each
            such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4% tax on its United States source gross
            transportation income, if any, each year because it does not have a fixed place of
            business in the United States and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship.
            Such United States source gross transportation income may be determined under any
            reasonable method, including ratios of days traveling directly to or from United States
            ports to total days traveling, or of the lessee’s United States source gross
            income from the ship (as determined under the source rules discussed in the preceding
            paragraph, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth therein) to the
            lessee’s total gross income from the ship.

Maltese Income Tax

Our Pullmantur ship owner-operator subsidiaries qualify as licensed
            shipping organizations in Malta. No Maltese income tax is charged on the income derived
            from shipping activities of a licensed shipping organization. Instead, a licensed
            shipping organization is liable to pay a tonnage tax based on the net tonnage
            of


the
            ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act. A
            company qualifies as a shipping organization if it engages in qualifying activities and
            it obtains a license from the Registrar-General to enable it to carry on such
            activities. Qualifying activities include, but are not limited to, the ownership,
            operation (under charter or otherwise), administration and management of a ship or
            ships registered as a Maltese ship in terms of the Merchant Shipping Act and the
            carrying on of all ancillary financial, security and commercial activities in
            connection therewith.

Our Maltese operations that do not qualify as licensed shipping
            organizations, which are not considered significant, remain subject to normal Maltese
            corporate income tax.

United Kingdom Income Tax

The

Brilliance of the Seas

is operated by a company that is strategically and commercially managed
            in the United Kingdom, which has elected to be subject to the United Kingdom tonnage
            tax regime (“U.K. tonnage tax”). Companies subject to U.K. tonnage tax pay
            a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of
            qualifying vessels. Normal United Kingdom corporate income tax is not chargeable on the
            relevant shipping profits of a qualifying U.K. tonnage tax company. The requirements
            for a company to qualify for the U.K. tonnage tax regime include being subject to
            United Kingdom corporate income tax, operating qualifying ships, which are
            strategically and commercially managed in the United Kingdom, and fulfilling a seafarer
            training requirement.

Relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of
            qualifying ships and from shipping related activities. Our United Kingdom income from
            non-shipping activities which do not qualify under the U.K. tonnage tax regime and
            which are not considered significant, remain subject to United Kingdom corporate income
            tax. However, Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) have announced its
            intention to make changes to the tonnage tax legislation in the Finance Act of 2008
            that include, among other things, amendments to the types of activities that qualify
            for the tonnage tax regime. We do not expect the impact of these changes to be material
            to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.

State Taxation

We, Celebrity Cruises Inc. and certain of our subsidiaries are subject
            to various U.S. state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s
            portion of the United States source income subject to federal income taxes.
            Additionally, the State of Alaska passed Ballot Initiative 2 which became effective in
            2007 and which among other things subjects commercial passenger vessel income to Alaska
            corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33% tax on income from onboard gambling
            activities. This did not have a material impact to our results of operations for the
            year ended December 31, 2007.

Other Taxation

We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the
            United States or other jurisdictions on income that does not qualify for exemption
            under Section 883 or tonnage tax regimes. The tax on such income was not material to
            our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Item
            1A. Risk Factors

The risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report
            on Form 10-K are important factors, among others, that could cause actual results to
            differ from expected or historical results. It is not possible to predict or identify
            all such factors. Consequently, this list should not be considered a complete statement
            of all potential risks or uncertainties. (See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
            Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a note regarding
            forward-looking statements.)

We
            may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation
            market

.

We operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many
            alternatives for people choosing a vacation. We therefore risk losing business not only
            to other cruise lines, but also to other vacation operators, which provide other
            leisure options including hotels, resorts and package holidays and tours.

We face significant competition from other cruise lines, both on the
            basis of cruise pricing and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer
            to passengers. Our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include
            Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns, among others, Carnival Cruise Lines,
            Princess Cruises, Costa Cruises, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Cunard Line and
            Aida Cruises; Star Cruises; NCL Corporation Ltd., which owns, among others, Norwegian
            Cruise Line; Mediterranean Shipping Company, which owns MSC Cruises; Disney Cruise
            Line; and

Oceania Cruises.


In the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation
            alternatives and cruise companies, our results of operations and financial position
            could be adversely affected.

Overcapacity within the cruise vacation industry, a reduction in
            demand or geo-political and economic uncertainties could have a negative impact on
            revenues, result in impairment of assets and may adversely affect our results of
            operations

.

Cruising capacity has grown in recent years and we expect it to increase
            further as the major cruise vacation companies introduce new ships. Demand for cruises
            has been and is expected to continue to be dependent on the strength of the economies
            in the countries in which we market our products, the public’s attitude towards
            the safety of travel and the geo-political climate. Economic or political changes may
            reduce demand for cruise vacations and may lead to reduced occupancy and/or price
            discounting. For instance, the current weakening of the U.S. economy and the tighter
            credit markets could have an adverse effect on vacationers’ discretionary income
            and consumer confidence, which could result in a lower demand for cruises, lower cruise
            prices and lower onboard revenues, all of which would adversely affect our revenues. In
            turn, these results could have a negative impact on revenues, result in impairment of
            assets and may adversely affect our financial position and results of
            operations.

Fears of terrorist attacks, war and other hostilities and the spread
            of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of
            operations.

Events such as terrorist attacks, war and other hostilities and the
            resulting political instability, travel restrictions, the spread of contagious diseases
            and concerns over safety, health and security aspects of traveling have had, and could
            have in the future, a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel
            and vacation industry. These events could also impact our ability to source qualified
            crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and, therefore, increase our
            shipboard employee costs.

Incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation
            industry or unusual weather conditions could affect our reputation and harm our future
            sales and results of operations

.

The operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents, illnesses
            and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety, health, security
            and vacation satisfaction and thereby adversely affect future industry performance.
            Incidents involving cruise ships, adverse media publicity concerning the cruise
            vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters, such as hurricanes
            and earthquakes, could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our
            results of operations.

Environmental, health and safety, financial responsibility and other
            maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating
            costs

.

The United States and various state and foreign government or regulatory
            agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies that
            could adversely impact the cruise vacation industry. Some environmental groups have
            lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative
            publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact. In addition,
            we are subject to various international, national, state and local laws, regulations
            and treaties that govern, among other things, safety standards applicable to our ships,
            health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers, security standards on board
            our ships and at the ship/port interface areas, and financial responsibilities to our
            passengers. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by
            the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of
            more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing
            compliance costs in the future.

In November 2007, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection
            (“CBP”) proposed an interpretive rule to the United States Passenger Vessel
            Services Act (“PVSA”) which would require that all roundtrip U.S. cruises
            by foreign flag vessels spend at least 48 hours in each foreign port of the cruise and
            that the time spent in foreign ports must be more than 50% of the time spent in all
            U.S. ports on the cruise. We believe that the CBP issued the proposed rule to protect
            Norwegian Cruise Line's operations in Hawaii by making it more difficult for
            foreign-flagged ships to conduct cruises going to Hawaii. However, if the rule is
            adopted as proposed, it could


be
            construed to apply to other non-Hawaii itineraries such as Seattle-based Alaska and
            some Caribbean cruises,

which may no longer qualify under the
            PVSA. If this was to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition
            and results of operations.

We
            may not be able to obtain financing on terms that are favorable or consistent with our
            expectations

.

To fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments, we rely on
            a combination of cash flows provided by operations, drawdowns under our available
            credit facilities, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or
            debt securities in private or public securities markets. Our credit ratings impact our
            ability to obtain financing in financial markets and the terms of the financing. Any
            lowering of our credit ratings may have adverse consequences on our ability to access
            the financial markets and/or on our cost of financings. In addition, interest rates and
            our ability to obtain financing are dependent on many economic and political factors
            beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that our cash flows from operations
            and additional financings will be available in accordance with our
            expectations.

Conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and
            other risks

.

We operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop
            our international presence. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks.
            Examples include political risks and risk of increases in duties and taxes as well as
            changes in laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses, or
            governing the operations of foreign-based companies. Additional risks include currency
            fluctuations, interest rate movements, imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on
            repatriation of earnings. If we are unable to address these risks adequately, our
            financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We have ship construction contracts, which are denominated in euros.
            While we have entered into euro-denominated forward contracts to manage a portion of
            the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts, we are exposed to
            fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction
            contracts that has not been hedged. If the shipyard is unable to perform under the
            related ship construction contract, any foreign currency hedges that were entered into
            to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated. Termination of these contracts
            could result in a significant loss.

Ship construction delays or mechanical faults may result in
            cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect
            our results of operations

.

We depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a
            timely basis and in good working order. The sophisticated nature of building a ship
            involves risks. Delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and
            may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate
            unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships. We have, for example, experienced mechanical
            problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance
            that we will not experience such problems in the future. Delays or cancellations of
            cruise ships may also adversely impact our ability to maintain our contractual minimum
            commitments to our ports. These events and any related adverse publicity could result
            in lost revenue, increased operating expenses, or both, and thus adversely affect our
            results of operations.

Shipyard financial difficulties or insolvencies, shortages in
            available shipbuilding facilities and component parts due to strong demand for
            shipbuilding services within the industry, and industry consolidations may cause
            delivery delays or price increases that could adversely affect our results of
            operations.

Conditions in the shipyard industry over which we have no control can
            affect our financial results. For example, we regularly introduce new ships to our
            fleet, and regularly repair and refurbish our existing fleet. The timely delivery of
            new ships and our ability to repair and refurbish our fleet can be adversely affected
            by factors such as shipyard financial difficulties, shortages in shipbuilding component
            parts and capacity constraints at qualified shipyard repair facilities. Delivery delays
            and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations, as can any
            constraints on our ability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis. In
            addition, the cruise shipyard industry is undergoing consolidation, which could result
            in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards, and thus higher prices for
            our ships.


Aker Yards Oy, the shipyard that is building

Independence of the Seas

and our two
            Project Genesis class ships, announced a lowering of its projected profits and delays
            in the construction of its vessels. We have engaged in discussions with Aker Yards Oy
            to assess the impact of this situation on the ships they are building for us. Based on
            such discussions, we do not expect that this situation will have a material impact on
            our results of operations. However, in the event that the financial situation of
            Aker Yards Oy deteriorates further, it could have a material impact on the delivery and
            costs associated with our Project Genesis class ships and our future results of
            operations.

Our
            operating costs and taxes could increase due to market forces and economic or political
            factors beyond our control.

Our operating costs, including fuel, food, payroll, insurance and
            security costs are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political
            instability or other factors beyond our control. Increases in these operating costs
            could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, United States state and local
            authorities as well as foreign authorities periodically consider increases in taxes.
            The implementation of these and other taxes could also cause an increase in our
            costs.

The Office of the Attorney General for the State of
            Florida is conducting a review of our temporary fuel supplement that we implemented in
            the fourth quarter of 2007 on our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and
            Azamara Cruises brands. We are cooperating with the Attorney General’s office in
            connection with this review and investigation. At this time, we are unable to determine
            the impact of this item on our 2008 consolidated financial
            statements.

Unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of
            operations

.

We believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers
            choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. The availability of ports
            is affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, existing capacity
            constraints, security concerns, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters,
            financial limitations on port development, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have
            with our competitors, local governmental regulations and local community concerns about
            port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional
            tourists. Any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the
            availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could
            adversely affect our results of operations.

Price increases for commercial airline service for our passengers or
            major changes or reduction in commercial airline service could undermine our ability to
            provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests.

Many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to
            transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark. Increases in
            the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our
            guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises. In addition, changes in the
            availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our ability to fly
            our passengers to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of
            operations.

A
            change in our tax status under the United States Internal Revenue Code, or other
            jurisdictions, may have adverse effects on our
            income

.

We and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive
            income from a United States trade or business and/or from sources within the United
            States. Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, our United States tax counsel, has delivered to
            us an opinion, based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it, to the
            effect that this income, to the extent derived from or incidental to the international
            operation of a ship or ships, is exempt from United States income tax pursuant to
            Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that most of our income (including
            that of our subsidiaries) is derived from or incidental to the international operation
            of a ship or ships.

In 2005, final regulations under Section 883 became effective, which
            narrowed somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the Internal Revenue
            Service to be incidental to the international operation of ships. To the extent the
            income from non-incidental activities is earned from sources within the United States,
            that income will be subject to United States taxation; but the determination of the
            precise amount of such United States source income involves some
            uncertainties.


It should also be noted that the provisions of
            Section 883 are subject to change at any time by legislation. Moreover, changes could
            occur in the future with respect to the identity, residence or holdings of our direct
            or indirect shareholders that could affect our eligibility for the Section 883
            exemption. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt
            from United States income tax on United States source shipping

income in the future. If we were not entitled to the benefit of Section
            883, we and our subsidiaries would be subject to United States taxation on a portion of
            the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships,
            which would reduce our net income. See

Taxation of the
            Company

above for a discussion of such taxation in the
            absence of an exemption under Section 883.

Finally, changes in the income tax laws affecting our operations in
            Malta, the United Kingdom or elsewhere could result in higher income taxes being
            charged against our operations, resulting in lower net income.

We are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to
            determine our policies, management and actions requiring shareholder
            approval

.

As of February 12, 2008, A. Wilhelmsen AS., a Norwegian corporation
            indirectly owned by members of the Wilhelmsen family of Norway, owned approximately
            20.1% of our common stock and Cruise Associates, a Bahamian general partnership
            indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the
            Pritzker family and a trust primarily for the benefit of certain members of the Ofer
            family, owned approximately 15.6% of our common stock. A. Wilhelmsen AS. and Cruise
            Associates have the power to determine, among other things:

• our policies and the policies of our subsidiaries,

• the persons who will be our directors and officers,
            and

• actions requiring shareholder approval.

A. Wilhelmsen AS. and Cruise Associates are parties to a
            shareholders’ agreement. The agreement provides that our board of directors will
            consist of the following persons:

• four nominees of A. Wilhelmsen AS.,

• four nominees of Cruise Associates and

• our Chief Executive Officer.

During the term of the shareholders’ agreement, certain corporate
            actions require the approval of at least one director nominated by A. Wilhelmsen AS.
            and one director nominated by Cruise Associates. Our principal shareholders are not
            prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business, subject to
            certain exceptions. If any person other than A. Wilhelmsen AS. and Cruise Associates,
            our two principal shareholders, acquires ownership of more than 30% of our common stock
            and our two principal shareholders, in the aggregate, own less of our common stock than
            such person and do not collectively have the right to elect, or to designate for
            election, at least a majority of the board of directors, we may be obligated to prepay
            indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities, which we may be
            unable to replace on similar terms. If this were to occur, it could have an adverse
            impact on our liquidity and operations.

The holders of our common stock may experience a decrease in the
            value of their equity interest as a result of the sale of currently restricted shares
            of our common stock into the public market

.

A substantial number of shares of our common stock were either issued by
            us in private transactions not involving a public offering or are held by our
            affiliates and, therefore the sale of these securities is subject to restrictions under
            the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”). These shares include the
            20.1% shares of our common stock held by A. Wilhelmsen AS. and the 15.6% held by Cruise
            Associates. No predictions can be made as to the effect, if any, that market sales of
            such shares, or the availability of such shares for future market sales, will have on
            the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial
            amounts of our common stock, or the perceptions that such sales could occur, could
            materially adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock and could
            impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities. Each of
            A. Wilhelmsen AS. and Cruise Associates has the right, pursuant to a registration
            rights agreement, to require us, subject to certain qualifications, to effect the
            registration under the Securities Act of all or part of their shares of common stock
            which would allow these shares to be sold into the public market.


We
            are not a United States corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the
            uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their
            interests

.

Our corporate affairs are governed by our Restated Articles of
            Incorporation and By-Laws and by the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. The
            provisions of the Business Corporation Act of Liberia resemble provisions of the
            corporation laws of a number of states in the United States. However, while most states
            have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate
            statutes, there are very few judicial cases in Liberia interpreting the Business
            Corporation Act of Liberia. For example, the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of
            directors under Liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary
            responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in
            certain United States jurisdictions. Thus, our public shareholders may have more
            difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management,
            directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation
            incorporated in a United States jurisdiction.

Litigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely
            impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or damage our
            reputation.

Our business is subject to various United States and international laws
            and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal
            penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper
            conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and/or lead to
            litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties,
            including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances it may not be economical
            to defend against such matters and/or a legal strategy my not ultimately result in us
            prevailing in a matter. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial
            condition or results of operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
            Condition and Results of Operations.

Our principal executive office and shoreside operations are located at
            the Port of Miami, Florida where we lease three office buildings totaling approximately
            359,000 square feet from Miami-Dade County, Florida, under long-term leases with
            initial terms expiring in various years in and after 2011. We also lease offices in
            Addlestone, England, which are used primarily to administer our Royal Caribbean
            International and Celebrity Cruises’ operations in Europe, an office in Madrid,
            Spain to administer our Pullmantur Cruises operations and offices in Singapore and
            Shanghai to administer our Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises’
            Asia/Pacific operations.

We lease an office building in Springfield, Oregon totaling
            approximately 163,000 square feet, which is used as a call center for reservations. In
            addition, we lease an office building in Wichita, Kansas totaling approximately 95,000
            square feet, which is used as a call center for reservations and customer
            service.

We lease two buildings in Miramar, Florida totaling approximately
            178,000 square feet. One building is used primarily as additional office space and the
            other building is used as a call center for reservations.

The lease of our current logistics center will expire in December 2008.
            We recently leased a building in Weston, Florida totaling approximately 267,000 square
            feet which will primarily serve as our logistics center, beginning in October
            2008.


Royal Caribbean International operates two private destinations: (i) an
            island we own in the Bahamas which we call

CocoCay; and (ii) Labadee, a
            secluded peninsula which we lease and is located on the north coast of
            Haiti.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In April 2005, a purported class action lawsuit was filed
            in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging that
            Celebrity Cruises improperly requires its cabin stewards to share guest gratuities with
            assistant cabin stewards. The suit sought payment of damages, including penalty wages
            under the U.S. Seaman’s Wage Act. In March 2006, the Southern District of Florida
            dismissed the suit and held that the case should be arbitrated pursuant to the
            arbitration provision in Celebrity’s collective bargaining agreement. In June
            2007, the United States 11th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District
            Court’s order dismissing the suit and subsequently denied the plaintiff’s
            petition for re-hearing and petition for re-hearing enbanc. In January 2008, the United
            States Supreme Court denied the plaintiff’s petition requesting that the Court
            grant certiorari jurisdiction over the action. We are not able at this time to estimate
            the impact of this proceeding.

In January 2006, a purported class action lawsuit was
            filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
            alleging that we infringed rights in copyrighted works and other intellectual property
            by presenting performances on our cruise ships without securing the necessary licenses.
            The suit seeks payment of damages, disgorgement of profits and a permanent injunction
            against future infringement. In April 2006, we filed a motion to sever and transfer the
            case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The
            motion is pending. We are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this
            proceeding.

We have a lawsuit pending in the Circuit Court for
            Miami-Dade County, Florida against Rolls Royce, co-producer of the Mermaid
            pod-propulsion system on Millennium-class ships, for the recurring Mermaid pod
            failures. Alstom Power Conversion, the other co-producer of the pod-propulsion system,
            settled out of this suit in January 2006 for $38.0 million. The $38.0 million
            settlement resulted in a gain of $36.0 million, net of reimbursements to insurance
            companies, which we recorded within other income in our consolidated statements of
            operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. We are not able at this time to
            estimate the outcome of the Rolls Royce proceeding.

Celebrity Cruises has been awarded damages in connection
            with its pending case in New York federal court against Essef Corp. for claims
            stemming from a 1994 outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease on one of Celebrity
            Cruises’ ships. The award reflects the culmination of two jury trials held
            in June 2006 and June 2007, respectively, as most recently modified by the trial judge
            in January 2008. Judgment has not yet been entered and when entered, the judgment is
            subject to appeal. The award would result in a net payment to Celebrity Cruises (after
            costs and payment to insurers) of approximately $15.0 million. We are not able at this
            time to estimate the outcome of this proceeding, and as of December 31, 2007, no amount
            of this award has been recognized in our consolidated financial
            statements.

In July 2006, a purported class action lawsuit was filed
            in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging
            that we failed to timely pay crew wages and failed to pay proper crew overtime. The
            suit seeks payment of damages, including penalty wages under the U.S. Seaman’s
            Wage Act and equitable relief damages under the California Unfair Competition Law. In
            December 2006, the District Court granted our motion to dismiss the claim and held that
            it should be arbitrated pursuant to the arbitration provision in Royal
            Caribbean’s collective bargaining agreement. In January 2007, the plaintiffs
            appealed the order to the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We are not able
            at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding on us.

The Miami District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment
            Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) has alleged that certain of our shipboard
            employment practices do not comply with U.S. employment laws. In June 2007, the EEOC
            proposed payment of monetary sanctions and certain remedial actions. We are reviewing
            the matter with the EEOC, and no legal proceedings have been initiated. We do not
            believe that this matter will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition
            or results of operations.


The Office of the Attorney General for the State of
            Florida is conducting a review of our fuel supplement that we implemented in the fourth
            quarter of 2007 on our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara
            cruise brands. In addition, we have been informed that the same office is conducting an
            investigation to determine whether there is or has been a violation of state or Federal
            anti-trust laws in connection with the setting by us and other cruise line operators
            of our respective fuel supplements. We are cooperating with the Attorney
            General’s office in connection with this review and investigation. We are
            not able at this time to estimate the impact of this review and investigation on
            us.

In February 2008, a purported class action lawsuit was
            filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The
            lawsuit alleges, among other things, that we, other cruise lines and a trade
            association violated Federal anti-trust laws or state deceptive and unfair trade
            practices laws by conspiring to fix the prices of the fuel supplements announced by the
            various cruise lines or misleading consumers as to the relationship between each cruise
            line’s fuel costs and the fuel supplements it is charging its customers. We are
            not able at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding on
            us.

We are routinely involved in other claims typical within
            the cruise vacation industry. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance. We
            believe the outcome of such claims, net of expected insurance recoveries, will not have
            a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of
            operations.

            stock. Since certain of our shares are held indirectly, the foregoing number is not
            representative of the number of beneficial owners.

Dividends

We declared cash dividends on our common stock of $0.15 per share in
            each of the quarters of 2007 and 2006.

Holders of our common stock have an equal right to share in our profits
            in the form of dividends when declared by our board of directors out of funds legally
            available for the distribution of dividends. Holders of our common stock have no rights
            to any sinking fund.

There are no exchange control restrictions on remittances of dividends
            on our common stock. Since (1) we are and intend to maintain our status as a
            nonresident Liberian entity under the Revenue Code of Liberia (2000) and the
            regulations thereunder, and (2) our ship-owning subsidiaries are not now engaged, and
            are not in the future expected to engage, in any business in Liberia, including voyages
            exclusively within the territorial waters of the Republic of Liberia, under current
            Liberian law, no Liberian taxes or withholding will be imposed on payments to holders
            of our securities other than to a holder that is a resident Liberian entity or a
            resident individual or an individual or entity subject to taxation in Liberia as a
            result of having a permanent establishment within the meaning of the Revenue Code of
            Liberia (2000) in Liberia.

The declaration of dividends shall at all times be subject to the final
            determination of our board of directors that a dividend is prudent at that time in
            consideration of the needs of the business. The shareholders agreement provides that A.
            Wilhelmsen AS. and Cruise Associates will from time to time consider our dividend
            policy with due regard for the interests of the shareholders in maximizing the return
            on their investment and our ability to pay such dividends. The shareholders agreement
            also provides that payment of dividends will depend, among other factors, upon our
            earnings, financial position and capital requirements and the income and other tax
            liabilities of A. Wilhelmsen AS., Cruise Associates and their respective affiliates
            relating to their ownership of common stock.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
            accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. (See Note
            1.

General

and Note 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary
            Data

.) Certain of our accounting policies are deemed
            “critical,” as they require management’s highest degree of judgment,
            estimates and assumptions. We have discussed these accounting policies and estimates
            with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe our most critical
            accounting policies are as follows:

Ship
            Accounting

Our ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost
            less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 15%
            projected residual value using the straight-line method over estimated service lives of
            primarily 30 years. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are
            capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’
            estimated useful lives. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or
            refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in
            cruise operating expenses. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as
            incurred. We use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the
            deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a
            straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock. Deferred drydock
            costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection
            with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel’s class
            certification. (See Note 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting
            Policies

to our consolidated financial statements under Item
            8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary
            Data

).

Our service life and residual value estimates take into consideration
            the impact of anticipated technological changes, long-term cruise and vacation market
            conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take
            into consideration our estimates of the average useful lives of the ships’ major
            component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins.
            Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related
            to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require
            considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. We do not have cost segregation
            studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems; therefore, we estimate
            the costs of component systems based principally on general and technical information
            known about major ship component systems and their lives and our knowledge of the
            cruise vacation industry. We do not identify and track depreciation by ship component
            systems, but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets
            replaced or refurbished.

We believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting
            purposes. However, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our
            estimates of ship service lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense
            could be materially higher or lower. If circumstances cause us to change our
            assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be
            capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could
            increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we had reduced our
            estimated average 30-year ship service life by one year, depreciation expense for 2007
            would have increased by approximately $25.0 million. If our ships were estimated to
            have no residual value, depreciation expense for 2007 would have increased by
            approximately $98.5 million.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived
            Intangible Assets

We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
            circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully
            recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover
            the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash
            flows. If these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the
            asset, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference between the
            asset’s estimated fair value and its carrying value.

The determination of fair value is based on quoted market prices in
            active markets, if available. Such markets are often not available for used cruise
            ships. Accordingly, we also base fair value on independent appraisals, sales price
            negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by
            management to be commensurate with the business risk. The estimation of fair value
            utilizing discounted forecasted cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which
            require our significant judgment when making assumptions of revenues, operating costs,
            marketing, selling and

administrative expenses, interest rates, ship
            additions and retirements, cruise vacation industry competition and general economic
            and business conditions, among other factors.


Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed
            annually, or when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment
            review for goodwill consists of a two- step process of first determining the fair value
            of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets
            allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the
            carrying value, no further analysis or write-down of goodwill is required. If the fair
            value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets, the
            implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the underlying assets and
            liabilities, including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets,
            based on their fair value. If necessary, goodwill is then written down to its implied
            fair value. The indefinite-life intangible asset impairment review consists of a
            comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible asset with its carrying
            amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized
            in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, the
            indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired.

The fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible
            asset is based on quoted market prices if available. Quoted market prices are often not
            available for individual reporting units and for indefinite-life intangible assets.
            Accordingly, we base the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life
            intangible asset on an expected present value technique, which is often the best
            technique available to estimate fair value. The expected present value technique for a
            reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible asset consists of estimating expected
            future cash flows discounted using a rate commensurate with the business risk. The
            estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes
            numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions
            of expected revenues, operating costs, marketing, selling and administrative expenses,
            interest rates, ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the
            cruise vacation industry competition and general economic and business conditions,
            among other factors.

We believe we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in
            determining whether our long-lived assets and intangible assets have been impaired;
            however, if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of
            fair values or if there is a material change in the conditions or circumstances
            influencing fair value, we could be required to recognize a material impairment
            charge.

Contingencies — Litigation

On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any
            lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically very difficult to
            determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to
            determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or
            final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable
            loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration
            estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. We accrue a liability when we
            believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to
            the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential
            insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts
            materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously
            made.

Terminology

Our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises. Demand is
            strongest for cruises during the North American summer months and holidays. Our
            revenues consist of the following items:

Passenger ticket revenues consist of revenue recognized from the sale of
            passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships.

Onboard and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale
            of goods and/or services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices,
            cancellation fees, sales of vacation protection insurance, pre- and post-cruise tours,
            Pullmantur Cruises’ land-based tours and hotel and air packages. Also included
            are revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a
            percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods and/or
            services onboard our ships.


Our cruise operating expenses consist of the following:

Commissions, transportation and other expenses consist of those costs
            directly associated with passenger ticket revenues, including travel agent commissions,
            air and other transportation expenses, port costs that vary with passenger head counts
            and related credit card fees.

Onboard and other expenses consist of the direct costs associated with
            onboard and other revenues. These costs include the cost of products sold onboard our
            ships, vacation protection insurance premiums, costs associated with pre- and
            post-cruise tours and related credit card fees. These costs also include minimal costs
            associated with concession revenues, as the costs are mostly incurred by third party
            concessionaires.

Payroll and related expenses consist of costs for shipboard
            personnel.

Food expenses include food costs for both passengers and
            crew.

Fuel expenses include fuel and related delivery and storage costs,
            including the financial impact of fuel swap agreements.

Other operating expenses consist primarily of operating costs such as
            repairs and maintenance, port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts, vessel
            operating lease costs, costs associated with Pullmantur Cruises’ land-based
            tours, vessel related insurance and entertainment.

We do not allocate payroll and related costs, food costs, fuel costs or
            other operating costs to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket
            revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total
            cruise vacation experience.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Available Passenger Cruise Days (“APCD”) are our measurement
            of capacity and represent double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise
            days for the period.

Gross Cruise Costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses
            plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.

Gross Yields represent total revenues per APCD.

Net Cruise Costs represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions,
            transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses (each of which is
            described below under the Overview heading). In measuring our ability to control costs
            in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs
            to be the most relevant indicator of our performance. A reconciliation of historical
            Gross Cruise Costs to Net Cruise Costs is provided below under

Summary of Historical Results of
            Operations

. We have not provided a quantitative
            reconciliation of projected Gross Cruise Costs to projected Net Cruise Costs due to the
            significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure.
            Accordingly, we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures
            would be meaningful.

Net Debt-to-Capital is a ratio which represents total long-term debt,
            including current portion of long-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents (“Net
            Debt”) divided by the sum of Net Debt and total shareholders' equity. We believe
            Net Debt and Net Debt-to-Capital, along with total long-term debt and shareholders'
            equity are useful measures of our capital structure. A reconciliation of historical
            Debt-to-Capital to Net Debt-to-Capital is provided below under

Summary of Historical Results of Operations.

Net Revenues represent total revenues less commissions, transportation
            and other expenses and onboard and other expenses (each of which is described under the
            Overview heading).

Net Yields represent Net Revenues per APCD. We utilize Net Revenues and
            Net Yields to manage our business on a day-to-day basis as we believe that it is the
            most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise
            revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs, which are
            commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses. A
            reconciliation of  historical


Gross Yields to Net Yields is provided below under

Summary of Historical Results of
            Operations

. We have not provided a quantitative
            reconciliation of projected Gross Yields to projected Net Yields due to the significant
            uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure. Accordingly, we
            do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be
            meaningful.

Occupancy, in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is
            calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100%
            indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.

Passenger Cruise Days represent the number of passengers carried for the
            period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.

Executive Overview

Over the past five years, we have experienced higher
            passenger ticket prices and onboard revenues while maintaining strong occupancies. As a
            result, Net Yields have grown from $146.63 in 2003 to $183.64 in 2007. The
            industry’s focus has shifted so that a larger portion of the revenue growth has
            come from markets outside of North America. We have responded to this shift by
            redeploying some of our ships to certain international markets such as Europe, Latin
            America and Asia, as well as focusing on the continued development of our international
            passenger sourcing. As a result, our passenger ticket revenues generated by sales
            originating outside of North America has increased from approximately 19% in 2003 to
            30% in 2007. Due to the recent recovery in North American bookings and continued
            strengthening internationally, we expect to see further yield improvements in 2008, in
            spite of the current weakening of the U.S. economy and the tighter credit markets.
            These current economic conditions, however, could eventually have an adverse effect on
            vacationers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence, which could result in
            a lower demand for cruises, lower cruise prices and lower onboard revenues in the
            future.

From 2003 through 2007, the cruise industry has been
            adversely impacted directly and indirectly by substantial increases in fuel prices. In
            2003, fuel cost per metric ton was $204, whereas in 2007, our fuel cost per metric ton
            was $455, an increase of 123%.  If our fuel cost per metric ton in 2007 had
            remained at 2003's level, our fuel expenses would have been approximately $300 million
            lower in 2007.  In addition, fuel and other factors have caused cost
            increases elsewhere including transportation, food products and other
            commodities.  We have been able to partially mitigate this increase in these costs
            with our hedging program and energy saving initiatives. Also, we implemented a
            temporary fuel supplement in 2008; however, we believe this fuel supplement will be
            partially offset by reductions in ticket prices. We believe higher and volatile fuel
            prices are a factor that will continue to impact our results of operations for the
            foreseeable future. Despite these pressures, we continue to focus on cost savings
            initiatives and expect to limit increases in our Net Cruise Costs on an APCD basis
            (excluding fuel) to 1% to 2% in 2008.

The Company expects to continue the expansion of its
            international passenger sourcing and the development and growth of its innovative fleet
            of ships. As of December 31, 2007, we had signed agreements with two shipyards
            providing for the construction of seven additional cruise ships. These new ships are
            expected to continue to help us maintain our current position within the worldwide
            cruise industry. The year-over-year percentage increase in our capacity for fiscal
            2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, is currently planned to be 5.1%, 9.3%, 11.4% and 6.4%
            respectively.


Summary of Historical Results of Operations

Total revenues increased 17.6% to $6.1 billion from total revenues of
            $5.2 billion in 2006 primarily due to a 12.3% increase in capacity and a 4.7% increase
            in Gross Yields. Net Yields increased by approximately 3.3% compared to the same period
            in 2006. The increase in Net Yields was primarily due to the addition of
            Pullmantur’s tour business which provides additional revenues without
            corresponding capacity and, to a lesser extent, a positive pricing environment. The
            increase in total revenues was offset by an increase in expenses primarily due to the
            increase in capacity and the acquisition of Pullmantur as well as an increase in
            interest expense. As a result, our net income was $603.4 million or $2.82 per share on
            a fully diluted basis in 2007 compared to $633.9 million or $2.94 per share on a fully
            diluted basis in 2006.

Highlights for 2007 included:

•

Total revenues increased 17.6% to $6.1 billion from total
                        revenues of $5.2 billion in 2006 primarily due to a 12.3% increase in
                        capacity and a 4.7% increase in Gross Yields. Net Yields increased by
                        approximately 3.3% compared to the same period in 2006.

•

Net Cruise Costs per APCD increased 6.6% compared to
                        2006.

•

Our Net Debt-to-Capital ratio decreased to 44.7% in 2007
                        from 46.6% in 2006. Similarly, our Debt-to-Capital ratio decreased to 45.7%
                        in 2007 from 47.1% in 2006.

•

We issued €1.0 billion, or approximately $1.3 billion,
                        of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2014 at a price of 99.638% of par. The
                        net proceeds from the offering were used to retire our unsecured bridge
                        loan facility obtained to finance our acquisition of Pullmantur Cruises and
                        to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving
                        credit facility.

•

We took delivery of

Liberty of the
                        Seas

, Royal Caribbean International’s
                        second Freedom-class ship, which was financed with a $589.0 million
                        unsecured term loan.

•

We placed two additional ship orders, one for Royal
                        Caribbean International and one for Celebrity Cruises, bringing our total
                        number of ships on order to seven for an additional capacity of
                        approximately 25,800 berths.

•

We purchased the 1,000-berth

Pacific Star

and will take
                        possession of the ship in March 2008 at which time the ship will begin
                        sailing under the name

Ocean
                        Dream

.

•

We launched a new brand, Azamara Cruises, designed to serve
                        the emerging deluxe cruise segment of the North American cruise
                        market.

                        facility to increase the amount available from $1.0 billion to $1.2
                        billion, reduce the effective interest rate to LIBOR plus 0.485%, change
                        the 0.175% commitment fee to a 0.140% facility fee and extend the maturity
                        date from March 27, 2010 to June 29, 2012.

•

We launched a second new brand, CDF Croisières de
                        France, designed to serve the contemporary segment of the French cruise
                        market with sailings beginning in May 2008. In April 2008,

Holiday Dream

will be
                        redeployed from Pullmantur Cruises to CDF Croisières de France and
                        will sail under the name

Outlook

On January 30, 2008, we announced the
            following guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2008:

Full Year 2008

We announced that bookings have been
            better than expected given the current economic conditions. We expected Net Yields to
            increase approximately 4% compared to 2007.

We expected Net Cruise Costs per APCD to increase approximately 2%
            compared to 2007. Excluding fuel, we expected Net Cruise Costs per APCD to increase in
            the range of 1% to 2% compared to 2007.

We do not forecast fuel prices and our cost outlook for fuel is based on
            current “at-the-pump” prices including any hedge impacts. If fuel prices
            for the full year 2008 remain at the level of January 30, 2008, fuel expenses for the
            full year 2008 would be approximately $595.0 million or $484 per metric ton. For the
            full year 2008, our fuel expense is 45% hedged and a 10% change in the market price of
            fuel would result in a change in fuel costs of approximately $35.0 million for the full
            year 2008, after taking into account existing hedges.

We expected a 5.1% increase in capacity in 2008, primarily driven by the
            addition of

Independence of the
            Seas

, which will enter service in May 2008, a full year
            of

Liberty of the Sea

s, the addition
            of

Pacific Star

, which will enter
            service during the first quarter of 2008 and the addition of

Celebrity Solstice,

which will enter
            service in December 2008.

Depreciation and amortization expenses were expected to be in the range
            of $525.0 million to $545.0 million, and interest expense was expected to be in the
            range of $340.0 million to $360.0 million.

Based on the expectations contained in this Outlook section, and
            assuming that fuel prices remain at the level of the January 30, 2008
            “at-the-pump” prices, we expected full year 2008 earnings per share to be
            in the range of $3.20 to $3.40.

First Quarter 2008

As announced on January 30, 2008, we
            expected Net Yields will increase approximately 7% compared to 2007.

We expected Net Cruise Costs per APCD to increase approximately 1%
            compared to 2007. Excluding fuel, we expected Net Cruise Costs per APCD to decrease in
            the range of 1% to 2% compared to 2007.

We do not forecast fuel prices and our cost outlook for fuel is based on
            current “at-the-pump” prices including any hedge impacts. If fuel prices
            for the first quarter of 2008 remain at the level of January 30, 2008, fuel expenses
            for the first quarter of 2008 would be approximately $145.0 million or $492 per metric
            ton. For the first quarter of 2008, our fuel expense is 52% hedged and a 10% change in
            the market price of fuel would result in a change in fuel costs of approximately $8.0
            million for the first quarter of 2008, after taking into account existing
            hedges.

We expected an 8.8% increase in capacity, primarily driven by the
            addition of

Liberty of the Seas

,
            which entered service in May 2007.

Depreciation and amortization expenses were expected to be in the range
            of $123.0 million to $128.0 million and interest expense was expected to be in the
            range of $82.0 million to $87.0 million.

Based on the expectations contained in this Outlook section, and
            assuming that fuel prices remain at the level of the January 30, 2008
            “at-the-pump” prices, we expected first quarter 2008 earnings per share to
            be in the range of $0.30 to $0.35.


Update to Outlook

Since our January 30, 2008 announcement, we have
            evaluated major changes in our operating environment including booking trends, fuel
            prices, the impact of our fuel supplement and other factors. Based on our evaluation of
            these factors, our outlook for the year remains substantially unchanged and we continue
            to expect full year 2008 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.40.
            Mainly due to a shift in the timing of certain expenses, we now believe first
            quarter earnings per share will be in the range of  $0.25 to
            $0.30.

Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended
            December 31, 2006

Revenues

Net Revenues increased 16.1% in 2007 compared to 2006 due
            to a 12.3% increase in capacity and a 3.3% increase in Net Yields. The increase in
            capacity was primarily attributed to the addition of Pullmantur Cruises’ fleet,
            the addition of

Liberty of the Seas

,
            which entered service in May 2007 and a full year of

Freedom
            of the Seas

. This increase was partially offset by the
            revitalization of

Majesty of the Seas

during the first quarter of 2007 which was out of service for 28 days
            and an increase in the number of days ships were in drydock during 2007 as compared to
            2006. The increase in Net Yields was primarily due to the addition of
            Pullmantur’s tour business which provides additional revenues without
            corresponding capacity and, to a lesser extent, an increase in ticket prices on a per
            passenger basis. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in onboard revenues
            primarily due to an expanded cruise season in certain markets and itinerary changes for
            certain ships where guests spend less onboard our ships. Occupancy in 2007 was 105.7%
            compared to 106.5% in 2006. Gross Yields increased 4.7% in 2007 compared to 2006, which
            was a larger percentage increase than Net Yields primarily due to increases in
            commissions, transportation, other expenses and onboard and other expenses. The
            increase in commissions, transportation and other expenses was primarily due to
            Pullmantur Cruise’s higher commission expenses. This increase was also due to
            increases in these direct costs as a result of an expanded cruise season in certain
            markets and itinerary changes for certain ships. The increase in onboard and other
            expenses was primarily due to increases in shore excursions and land-tour packages sold
            to our guests as a result of an expanded cruise season in certain markets and itinerary
            changes for certain ships as well as the acquisition of Pullmantur.

Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $239.3
            million and $234.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in concession
            revenues was primarily due to the increase in capacity mentioned above.

Expenses

Net Cruise Costs increased 19.8% in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a 12.3%
            increase in capacity mentioned above and a 6.6% increase in Net Cruise Costs per APCD.
            The increase in Net Cruise Costs per APCD was primarily due to increases in other
            operating expenses. Other operating expenses increased primarily due to the addition of
            Pullmantur’s tour business which adds costs without corresponding capacity. Gross
            Cruise Costs increased 20.6% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the same
            reasons discussed above for Net Cruise

Costs.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 14.6% in 2007 compared
            to 2006. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the Pullmantur fleet and the
            addition of

Liberty of the Seas

,
            which entered service in May 2007. The increase was also due to the incremental
            depreciation as a result of the addition of

Freedom of the
            Seas

, which entered service in June

,

shore side additions and ship
            improvements.

Other Income (Expense)

Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased to $333.8
            million in 2007 from $267.9 million in 2006. Gross interest expense increased to $373.7
            million in 2007 from $295.7 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to a higher
            average debt level. Interest capitalized increased to $39.9 million in 2007 from $27.8
            million in 2006 primarily due to a higher average level of investment in ships under
            construction. These amounts are recorded in interest expense, net of interest
            capitalized.


Other income decreased to $15.8 million in 2007 from
            $28.1 million in 2006. The decrease was primarily due to a $36.0 million gain on the
            settlement of a lawsuit in 2006 that did not recur in 2007, partially offset by a gain
            of $23.1 million related to certain derivative instruments associated with our ship
            construction firm commitments denominated in euros that did not qualify for hedge
            accounting treatment.

Year
            Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Revenues

Net Revenues increased 6.5% in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a 3.4%
            increase in Net Yields and a 3.0% increase in capacity. The increase in Net Yields was
            primarily due to higher cruise ticket prices, onboard spending and revenue associated
            with the charter of

Horizon

to
            Island Cruises, our joint venture with TUI Travel. Higher cruise ticket prices were
            primarily attributable to a strong demand environment. The increase in capacity was
            primarily attributed to the addition of

Freedom of the
            Seas

in 2006 and the lengthening of

Enchantment of the Seas

in 2005. This
            increase was partially offset by the charter of

Horizon

to Island Cruises.

Occupancy in 2006 was 106.5% compared to 106.6% in 2005. Gross Yields
            increased 3.5% in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the same reasons discussed
            above for Net Yields.

Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $234.5
            million and $223.0 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in concession
            revenues was primarily due to the increase in capacity mentioned above and higher
            amounts spent per passenger onboard.

Expenses

Net Cruise Costs increased 9.7% in 2006 compared to 2005 due to a 6.4%
            increase in Net Cruise Costs per APCD and the 3.0% increase in capacity mentioned
            above. Approximately 4.0 percentage points of the increase in Net Cruise Costs per APCD
            were attributed to increases in fuel expenses. Total fuel expenses (net of the
            financial impact of fuel swap agreements) increased 28.2% per metric ton in 2006 as
            compared to an increase of 46.0% per metric ton in 2005. As a percentage of total
            revenues, fuel expenses were 9.2% and 7.5% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
            remaining 2.4 percentage points of the increase in Net Cruise Costs per APCD were
            primarily attributed to increases in marketing, selling and administrative expenses
            associated with personnel costs. Gross Cruise Costs increased 8.8% in 2006 compared to
            2005, which was a lower percentage increase than Net Cruise Costs primarily due to
            lower trip insurance expenses a result of lower trip insurance premiums and lower
            commission expenses as a result of an increase in direct business.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 4.9% in 2006 compared
            to 2005. The increase was primarily due to the addition of

Freedom of the Seas,

ship improvements and
            shore side additions.

Other Income (Expense)

Gross interest expense increased to $295.7 million in 2006 from $287.4
            million in 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates,
            partially offset by lower average debt levels. Interest capitalized increased to $27.8
            million in 2006 from $17.7 million in 2005 primarily due to a higher average level of
            investment in ships under construction.

During 2006, we partially settled a pending lawsuit against Rolls Royce
            and Alstom Power Conversion, co-producers of the mermaid pod-propulsion system on
            Millennium-class ships, for the recurring Mermaid pod failures. Under the terms of the
            partial settlement, we received $38.0 million from Alstom and released them from the
            suit, which remains pending against Rolls Royce. The $38.0 million settlement resulted
            in a gain of $36.0 million, net of reimbursements to insurance companies.

In July 2005, TUI Travel redeemed in full its 6.75% convertible
            preferred shares. We received $348.1 million in cash, resulting in a net gain of $44.2
            million, primarily due to foreign exchange.

Dividend income decreased approximately $14.2 million for 2006 compared
            to 2005 due to the redemption of our TUI Travel investment in the third quarter of
            2005.


Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle

In the third quarter of 2005, we changed our method of accounting for
            drydocking costs from the accrual in advance to the deferral method (see Note 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial
            statements under Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

). The
            change resulted in a one-time gain of $52.5 million, or $0.22 per share on a diluted
            basis, to recognize the cumulative effect of the change on prior years, which we
            reflected as part of our results in 2005. Other than this one-time gain, the change did
            not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash

Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a
            significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3
            billion in 2007 and $948.5 million in 2006. The increase was primarily a result of an
            increase in customer deposits of $184.7 million and an increase in accrued expenses and
            other liabilities of $150.2 million. The increase in customer deposits was primarily
            due to incremental deposits received for our recently acquired and soon to be delivered
            ships

.

This increase was also due
            to higher ticket prices and the timing of scheduled drydocks as compared to 2006.
            The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was due to the timing of
            payments of interest and other short-term liabilities. The increase in net cash
            provided by operating activities was also due to $121.2 million in payments of accreted
            interest on the LYONs repurchase in 2006 that did not recur in 2007.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased to $1.2
            billion in 2007 from $1.8 billion in 2006. The decrease was primarily due to $553.3
            million related to the purchase of Pullmantur, net of cash acquired, during 2006 that
            did not recur in 2007. The decrease was also due to the purchase of $100.0 million of
            notes from TUI Travel during 2006 which were repaid in 2007. The decrease was partially
            offset by an increase in capital expenditures which were $1.3 billion in 2007, compared
            to $1.2 billion in 2006. Capital expenditures were primarily related to the purchase
            of

Pacific Star

, the deliveries
            of

Liberty of the Seas

in 2007
            and

Freedom of the Seas

in 2006 as
            well as progress payments for ships under construction in both
            years.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $36.6 million in 2007
            compared to $879.7 million in 2006. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in
            proceeds from debt issuances of $998.9 million and an increase in repayments of debt of
            $20.0 million. The decrease was also partially offset by $164.6 million of treasury
            stock purchased during 2006 that did not recur in 2007. During 2007, we received net
            proceeds of €990.9 million, or $1.3 billion, from a bond offering consisting of
            €1.0 billion, or $1.3 billion, of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2014. In
            addition, we received $589.0 million through an unsecured term loan due through 2014 to
            purchase

Liberty of the Seas

and
            drew $50.0 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility. During 2007, we made
            debt repayments on various loan facilities and capital leases, including a payment of
            $906.5 million to retire the €701.0 million outstanding balance on our unsecured
            bridge loan facility. In addition, we made $465.0 million in payments towards our
            unsecured revolving credit facility, a payment of $200.0 million to retire our 7%
            unsecured senior notes due 2007, and a payment of $61.2 million to repay term loans
            secured by two Celebrity ships. During 2007 and 2006 we received $19.6 million and
            $23.0 million, respectively, in connection with the exercise of common stock options
            and we paid cash dividends on our common stock of $98.3 million and $124.5 million,
            respectively. Net Debt-to-Capital decreased to 44.7% in 2007 compared to 46.6% in 2006.
            Similarly, our Debt-to-Capital ratio decreased to 45.7% in 2007 from 47.1% in
            2006.

Interest capitalized during 2007 increased to $39.9 million from $27.8
            million in 2006 primarily due to a higher average level of investment in ships under
            construction.

Future Capital Commitments

Our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As
            of December 31, 2007, we had one Freedom-class ship and two ships of a new Project
            Genesis class designated for Royal Caribbean International and four Solstice-class
            ships, designated for Celebrity Cruises

,

on order for an aggregate additional capacity of approximately 25,800
            berths. The aggregate cost of the seven ships is approximately $7.0 billion, of which
            we have deposited $499.6 million as of December 31, 2007. Approximately 7.7% of the
            aggregate cost of ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro

exchange
            rate at December 31, 2007. (See Note 13.

Fair Value of
            Financial Instruments

to our consolidated financial
            statements under Item 8.

Financial Statements and
            Supplementary Data

).


As of December 31, 2007 we anticipated overall capital expenditures,
            including the seven ships on order, will be approximately $1.9 billion for 2008, $2.0
            billion for 2009, $2.2 billion for 2010, and $1.0 billion for 2011.

Recently we reached an agreement with
            Meyer Werft to build a fifth Solstice-class ship for Celebrity Cruises, subject to
            certain conditions, for an additional capacity of approximately 2,850 berths, expected
            to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2012. Based on current exchange rates, we
            estimate the all-in cost of this ship will be approximately $320,000 per berth. This
            amount is not included in the anticipated overall capital expenditures reflected
            above.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet
            Arrangements

As of December 31, 2007, our contractual obligations were as follows (in

As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions,
            pricing and our overall growth strategy, we continuously consider opportunities to
            enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. We may also consider the
            sale of ships. We continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances.
            If any of these were to occur, they would be financed through the incurrence of
            additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or
            through cash flows from operations.

Under the

Brilliance of the Seas

operating lease, we have agreed to indemnify the lessor to the extent
            its after-tax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in corporate tax
            rates, capital allowance deductions and certain unfavorable determinations which may be
            made by United Kingdom tax authorities. These indemnifications could result in an
            increase in our lease payments. We are unable to estimate the maximum potential
            increase in our lease payments due to the various circumstances, timing or a
            combination of events that could trigger such indemnifications. Under current
            circumstances we do not believe an indemnification in any material amount is
            probable.

Some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification
            provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events
            occur. These contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes, increased lender
            capital costs and other similar costs. The indemnification clauses are often standard
            contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business. There are no
            stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able
            to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these
            indemnification clauses. We have not been required to make any payments under such
            indemnification clauses in the past and, under current circumstances, we do not believe
            an indemnification in any material amount is probable.

Other than the items described above, we are not party to any other
            off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent
            interest, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities, that either
            have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our
            financial position.

Funding Sources

As of December 31, 2007, our liquidity was $1.4 billion consisting of
            approximately $0.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion available
            under our unsecured revolving credit facility. (See Note 6.

Long-Term Debt

to our consolidated
            financial statements under Item 8.

Financial Statements and
            Supplementary Data

.) We have contractual obligations of
            approximately $2.0 billion due during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2008.
            We anticipate these contractual obligations could be funded through a combination of
            cash


flows from operations, drawdowns under our available unsecured revolving
            credit facility, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or
            debt securities in private or public securities markets. Although we believe our
            existing unsecured revolving credit facility, cash flows from operations, our ability
            to obtain new borrowings and/or raise new capital or a combination of these sources
            will be sufficient to fund operations, debt payment requirements, capital expenditures
            and other commitments over the next twelve-month period, there can be no assurances
            that these sources of cash will be available in accordance with our
            expectations.

Our financing agreements contain covenants that require us, among other
            things, to maintain minimum net worth, fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our net
            debt-to-capital ratio. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31,
            2007.

If any person other than A. Wilhelmsen AS. and Cruise Associates, our
            two principal shareholders, acquires ownership of more than 30% of our common stock and
            our two principal shareholders, in the aggregate, own less of our common stock than
            such person and do not collectively have the right to elect, or to designate for
            election, at least a majority of the board of directors, we may be obligated to prepay
            indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities, which we may be
            unable to replace on similar terms. If this were to occur, it could have an adverse
            impact on our liquidity and operations.


Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
            Risk

Financial Instruments and Other

General

We are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates,
            foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these risks through a
            combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of
            derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies. The
            financial impacts of these hedging instruments are primarily offset by corresponding
            changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching
            the amount, term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk
            being hedged. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or
            other speculative purposes. We monitor our derivative positions using techniques
            including market valuations and sensitivity analyses. (See Note 13.

            consolidated financial statements under Item 8.

Financial
            Statements and Supplementary Data.

)

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our
            long-term debt obligations and our operating lease for

Brilliance of the Seas

. At December 31,
            2007, 58% of our long-term debt was effectively fixed and 42% was floating. We enter
            into interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements
            and to manage our interest expense and rent expense.

Market risk associated with our long-term fixed rate debt is the
            potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates. At
            December 31, 2007, our interest rate swap agreements effectively changed $350.0 million
            of fixed rate debt with a weighted-average fixed rate of 7.25% to LIBOR-based floating
            rate debt, and €1.0 billion of fixed rate debt with a weighted-average fixed rate
            of 5.625% to EURIBOR-based floating rate debt. We have cross currency swap agreements
            that effectively change €300.0 million of the €1.0 billion floating
            EURIBOR-based debt to floating LIBOR-based debt. (See

Foreign
            Currency Exchange Rate Risk

for further information). The
            estimated fair value of our long-term fixed rate debt at December 31, 2007, was $5.0
            billion using quoted market prices, where available, or using the present value of
            expected future cash flows. The fair value of our associated interest rate swap
            agreements was estimated to be an asset of $23.4 million as of December 31, 2007 based
            on the present value of expected future cash flows. A hypothetical one percentage point
            decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2007 would increase the fair value of our
            long-term fixed rate debt, by approximately $99.5 million, net of an increase in the
            fair value of the associated interest rate swap agreements.

Market risk associated with our long-term floating rate debt is the
            potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates. A
            hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our 2008
            interest expense by approximately $19.3 million, assuming no change in exchange
            rates.

Market risk associated with our operating lease for

Brilliance of the Seas

is the potential
            increase in rent expense from an increase in sterling LIBOR rates. As of January 2008,
            we have effectively changed 50% of the operating lease obligation from a floating rate
            to a fixed rate obligation with a weighted-average rate of 4.76% through rate fixings
            with the lessor. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in sterling LIBOR rates
            would increase our 2008 rent expense by approximately $2.2 million, based on the
            exchange rate at December 31, 2007.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
            risk relates to our ship construction firm commitments denominated in euros. We
            enter into euro-denominated forward contracts to manage this risk. The estimated fair
            value of such euro-denominated forward contracts at December 31, 2007, was a net
            unrealized gain of approximately $413.7 million, based on the present value of expected
            future cash flows. At December 31, 2007, approximately 7.7% of the aggregate cost of
            the ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate. A hypothetical 10%
            strengthening of the euro as of December 31, 2007, assuming no changes in comparative
            interest rates, would result in a $620.3 million increase in the United States dollar
            cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts. This increase
            would be largely offset by an increase in the fair value of our euro-denominated
            forward contracts.


As discussed above, we have cross currency swap agreements that
            effectively change €300.0 million of floating EURIBOR-based debt to $389.1 million
            of floating LIBOR-based debt at December 31, 2007. (See

Interest Rate Risk

for further
            information). The estimated fair value of these cross currency swap agreements at
            December 31, 2007, was an asset of approximately $54.0 million based on the present
            value of expected future cash flows. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the euro as of
            December 31, 2007, assuming no changes in comparative interest rates, would result in
            an increase in the fair value of the €300.0 million of floating EURIBOR-based debt
            by $43.8 million, offset by an increase in the fair value of the cross currency swap
            agreements of $44.7 million.

Also, we consider our investments in foreign subsidiaries to be
            denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a long-term nature. We partially
            address the exposure of our investments in foreign subsidiaries by denominating a
            portion of our debt in our subsidiaries’ functional currencies (generally euros).
            Specifically, we have assigned debt of approximately €466.0 million, or
            approximately $679.9 million, as a hedge of our net investment in Pullmantur and,
            accordingly, have included approximately $64.0 million of foreign-currency transaction
            losses in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated
            other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2007. A hypothetical 10% increase or
            decrease in the December 31, 2007 foreign currency exchange rate would increase or
            decrease the fair value of our assigned debt by $68.0 million, which would be offset by
            a corresponding decrease or increase in the U.S. dollar value of our net
            investment.

Fuel
            Price Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the
            consumption of fuel on our ships. Fuel cost (net of the financial impact of fuel swap
            agreements), as a percentage of our total revenues, was approximately 8.9% in 2007,
            9.2% in 2006 and 7.5% in 2005. We use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial
            impact of fluctuations in fuel prices. As of December 31, 2007, we had fuel swap
            agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of
            approximately $223.9 million, maturing through 2009. The estimated fair value of these
            contracts at December 31, 2007 was an unrealized gain of $68.6 million. We estimate
            that a hypothetical 10% increase in our weighted-average fuel price from that
            experienced during the year ended December 31, 2007 would increase our 2008 fuel cost
            by approximately $57.4 million. This increase would be partially offset by an increase
            in the fair value of our fuel swap agreements maturing in 2008 of approximately $20.8
            million.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
            including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and
            Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
            disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
            13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that those
            controls and procedures were effective.


Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
            Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
            internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
            13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
            including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and
            Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
            internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated

Framework

issued by the Committee of
            Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the
            framework in

Internal Control-Integrated
            Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control
            over

financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.
            The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
            2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered
            certified public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements
            included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as stated in their report, which is
            included on page F-2.

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
            identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act
            Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that have materially
            affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
            financial reporting.

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed
            and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
            objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is
            based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because
            of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only the
            reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all
            potential future conditions.

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES
            LTD.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Report of Independent Registered Certified Public Accounting
            Firm

To
            the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of
            Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd.

In
            our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
            statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all
            material respects, the financial position of Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. and its
            subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the results of their
            operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
            December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
            United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
            respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
            based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
            Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
            of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these
            financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
            reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
            financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
            Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions
            on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial
            reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
            the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
            standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
            about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
            effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
            respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
            evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
            the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
            evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control
            over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
            financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
            and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
            assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
            considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
            reasonable basis for our opinions.

As
            discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its
            method of accounting for dry dock costs in 2005.

A
            company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
            provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
            preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
            accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
            reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
            maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
            transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
            reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
            of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
            and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
            with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
            reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
            acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
            material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
            reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
            of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
            inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
            policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
            STATEMENTS

Note
            1.

General

Description of Business

We are a global cruise company. We own five cruise brands, Royal
            Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Pullmantur Cruises, and Azamara Cruises
            with 21, eight, four and two ships, respectively, at December 31, 2007, and CDF
            Croisières de France, which will begin operating one ship in May 2008. Our ships
            operate on a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on approximately 380
            destinations. In addition, we have a 50% investment in a joint venture with TUI Travel
            PLC (“TUI Travel”), formerly First Choice Holidays PLC, which operates the
            brand Island Cruises, and we charter one ship to Island Cruises. We also lease one ship
            under a seasonal vessel operating lease agreement for The Scholar Ship, our education
            program at sea for graduate and undergraduate students.

Basis for Preparation of Consolidated Financial
            Statements

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
            accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Estimates are
            required for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
            principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could
            differ from these estimates. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
            eliminated in consolidation. We consolidate entities over which we have control,
            usually evidenced by a direct ownership interest of greater than 50%. For affiliates
            where significant influence over financial and operating policies exists, usually
            evidenced by a direct ownership interest from 20% to 50%, the investment is accounted
            for using the equity method.

Note
            2.

Summary of Significant Accounting
            Policies

Change in Accounting Principle Related to Drydocking
            Costs

In the third quarter of 2005, we changed our method of accounting for
            drydocking costs from the accrual in advance to the deferral method. Under the accrual
            in advance method, estimated drydocking costs are accrued evenly over the period to the
            next scheduled drydock. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are
            deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next
            scheduled drydock. The deferral method is preferable because it only recognizes the
            liability when incurred and does not require the use of estimates inherent in the
            accrual in advance method. The cumulative effect of the change on prior years of $52.5
            million, or $0.22 per share on a diluted basis, was included in net income for the year
            ended December 31, 2005. Other than this one-time gain, the change did not have a
            material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Revenues and Expenses

Deposits received on sales of passenger cruises are initially recorded
            as customer deposit liabilities on our balance sheet. Customer deposits are
            subsequently recognized as passenger ticket revenues, together with revenues from
            onboard and other goods and services and all associated direct costs of a voyage, upon
            completion of voyages with durations of ten days or less, and on a pro rata basis for
            voyages in excess of ten days.

Cash
            and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and marketable securities with
            original maturities of less than 90 days.

F-8

Inventories

Inventories consist of provisions, supplies and fuel carried at the
            lower of cost (weighted-average) or market.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less
            accumulated depreciation and amortization. We capitalize interest as part of the cost
            of acquiring certain assets. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships
            are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the improvements’
            estimated useful lives. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or
            refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in
            cruise operating expenses. Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to cruise
            operating expenses as incurred and, commencing in 2005, drydocking costs are deferred
            and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled
            drydock. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other
            costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the
            vessel’s class certification. Liquidated damages received from shipyards as a
            result of the late delivery of a new ship are recorded as reductions to the cost basis
            of the ship. We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
            circumstances indicate, based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows, that the
            carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable.

Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using
            the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of primarily 30 years for ships,
            net of a 15% projected residual value, and three to 40 years for other property and
            equipment. Depreciation for assets under capital leases and leasehold improvements is
            computed using the shorter of the lease term or related asset life. (See Note 4.

Property and Equipment

.)

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair
            value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. We review goodwill
            for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or when events or circumstances
            dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a two- step
            process of first determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to
            the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value
            of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, no further analysis or write-down of
            goodwill is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying
            value of the net assets, the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to
            all the underlying assets and liabilities, including both recognized and unrecognized
            tangible and intangible assets, based on their fair value. If necessary, goodwill is
            then written down to its implied fair value.

Intangible Assets

In connection with our acquisitions, we have acquired
            certain intangible assets of which value has been assigned to them based on our
            estimates. Intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are not
            amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test, or when events or
            circumstances dictate, more frequently. The indefinite-life intangible asset impairment
            test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible asset
            with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment
            loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its
            carrying amount, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered
            impaired.

Other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are
            amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred except those costs, which
            result in tangible assets, such as brochures, which are treated as prepaid expenses and
            charged to expense as consumed. Advertising costs consist of media advertising as well
            as brochure, production and direct mail costs. Media advertising was $153.4 million,
            $141.3 million and $139.1 million, and brochure, production and direct mail costs were
            $99.0 million, $89.5 million and $86.9 million for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
            respectively.

F-9

Derivative Instruments

We enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our
            interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency
            exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are designated as hedges and are
            recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Our derivative instruments are not
            held for trading or speculative purposes.

At inception of the hedge relationship, a derivative instrument that
            hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, or
            a firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge. A derivative instrument that
            hedges a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows related to a
            recognized asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair
            value hedges are offset against changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged
            assets, liabilities or firm commitments. Changes in fair value of derivatives that are
            designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other
            comprehensive (loss) income until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in
            earnings. The foreign-currency transaction gain or loss of our nonderivative financial
            instrument designated as a hedge of our net investment in our foreign operations is
            recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income along with the
            associated foreign currency translation adjustment of the foreign
            operation.

On an ongoing basis, we assess whether derivatives used in hedging
            transactions are “highly effective” in offsetting changes in the fair value
            or cash flow of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly
            effective as a hedge or hedge accounting is discontinued, any change in fair value of
            the derivative since the last date at which it was determined to be effective is
            recognized in earnings. In addition, the ineffective portion of our highly effective
            hedges is recognized in earnings immediately and reported in other income (expense) in
            our consolidated statements of operations.

Cash flows from derivative instruments that are designated as fair value
            or cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the
            underlying hedged items. In the event that hedge accounting is discontinued, cash flows
            subsequent to the date of discontinuance are classified consistent with the nature of
            the instrument.

Foreign Currency Translations and Transactions

We translate assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose
            functional currency is the local currency, at exchange rates in effect at the balance
            sheet date. We translate revenues and expenses at weighted-average exchange rates for
            the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting foreign currency
            translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
            (loss) income, which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders’
            equity. Exchange gains or losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and
            liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity
            involved are immediately included in our earnings, unless certain liabilities have been
            designated to act as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The majority
            of our transactions are settled in United States dollars. Gains or losses resulting
            from transactions denominated in other currencies are recognized in income at each
            balance sheet date.

F-10

Concentrations of Credit Risk

We monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with
            financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business. Credit
            risk, including but not limited to counterparty nonperformance under derivative
            instruments and new ship progress payment guarantees, is considered minimal, as we
            primarily conduct business with large, well-established financial institutions and
            insurance companies that we have well established relationships with and that have
            credit risks acceptable to us or the credit risk is spread out among a large number of
            creditors. We do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our significant
            counterparties. In addition, we have established guidelines regarding credit ratings
            and investment maturities that we follow to maintain safety and liquidity. We do not
            normally require collateral or other security to support credit relationships; however,
            in certain circumstances this option is available to us. We normally require guarantees
            to support new ship progress payments to shipyards.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
            weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.
            Diluted earnings per share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the
            assumed exercise of stock options and conversion of potentially dilutive securities. In
            addition, net income is adjusted to add back the amount of interest recognized in the
            period associated with convertible dilutive securities. (See Note 9.

Earnings Per Share.

)

Stock-Based Employee Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
            Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
            Payment,” (“SFAS 123R”). SFAS 123R requires the measurement and
            recognition of compensation expense at the fair value of employee stock awards.
            Compensation expense for awards and related tax effects is recognized as they vest.
            Through December 31, 2005, we used the intrinsic value method to account for
            stock-based awards to our employees under APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
            Stock Issued to Employees,” and disclosed pro forma information as if we had
            applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
            Stock-Based Compensation.” We have adopted SFAS 123R using the modified
            prospective transition method in which we are recognizing compensation expense on the
            unvested portion of the awards over the remaining vesting period. Under this transition
            method, prior period results have not been restated. In addition, SFAS 123R requires us
            to estimate the amount of expected forfeitures in calculating compensation costs for
            all outstanding awards. Previously, we had accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.
            As of January 1, 2006, the cumulative effect of adopting the expected forfeiture method
            and the impact on cash flows was not significant.

The impact of adopting SFAS 123R was a reduction of our net income by
            approximately $10.3 million and $11.3 million, or $0.05 on a basic and diluted earnings
            per share basis, for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006,
            respectively.

Segment Reporting

We operate four cruise brands, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity
            Cruises, Pullmantur Cruises, and Azamara Cruises, and launched a new brand, CDF
            Croisières de France, which will commence operations in May 2008. The brands
            have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their
            economic characteristics as well as products and services provided.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
            (“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 48,
            “

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
            interpretation of FASB Statement No.109”

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
            uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements.
            FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
            statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
            in the tax return. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption did not have a
            material impact on our 2007 consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
            Standard (“SFAS”) No. 157,

“Fair Value
            Measurements”

(“SFAS
            157”)

.

SFAS 157 defines fair
            value, establishes a formal framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
            about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective the first fiscal year beginning
            after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within that fiscal year, and is applied
            prospectively with the exception of certain financial instruments. In February 2008,
            the FASB issued a FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) that amends SFAS 157 to delay
            the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial
            liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
            financial statements on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after November 15,
            2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB also
            issued a FSP that would exclude leasing transactions accounted for under SFAS No.
            13,

"Accounting for Leases",

and its
            related interpretive accounting pronouncements. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS
            157 and related guidance to have a material impact on our 2008 consolidated financial
            statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
            “

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
            Financial Liabilities

” (“SFAS
            159”)

.

Under SFAS 159,
            entities will have the option to measure certain financial instruments and other items
            at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value. At the effective date, a
            company may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date. The
            effect of this election is reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening
            balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. SFAS 159 is effective the first
            fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS 159 will not
            have a material impact on our 2008 consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised
            2007),

“Business Combinations,”

(“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R requires the acquiring entity in a
            business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and
            liabilities assumed in the transaction whether full or partial acquisition, establishes
            the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired
            and liabilities assumed, requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring
            costs, and requires the acquirer to disclose all information needed to evaluate and
            understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS 141R
            applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control of one
            or more businesses, including combinations achieved without transfer of consideration,
            for example, by contract alone or through the lapse of minority veto rights. SFAS 141R
            applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
            after the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008. We are
            currently evaluating the impact SFAS 141R may have on our consolidated financial
            statements.

F-12

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
            “

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements
            – An Amendment of ARB No. 51,”

(“SFAS
            160”). SFAS 160 requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling (minority)
            interests as equity as opposed to as a liability or mezzanine equity and
            provides

guidance on the
            accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests. SFAS 160 is
            effective the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods
            within that fiscal year. SFAS 160 applies prospectively as of the beginning of the
            fiscal year SFAS 160 is initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure
            requirements which are applied retrospectively for all periods presented subsequent to
            adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact SFAS 160 may have on our consolidated
            financial statements.

Business
            Combination

In November 2006, we completed our acquisition of Pullmantur, a
            Madrid-based cruise and tour operator. The Pullmantur Cruises brand increases our
            presence in Spain and provides us with an opportunity to further grow our business in
            Europe and Latin America and to increase our product offerings. Pullmantur Cruises also
            provides us an opportunity for incremental guest, revenue and earnings growth. We
            purchased all of the capital stock of Pullmantur for approximately €436.3 million,
            or approximately $558.9 million. We include Pullmantur’s results of operations on
            a two-month lag to allow for more timely preparation of our consolidated financial
            statements.

The acquisition was accounted for as a business purchase combination
            using the purchase method of accounting under the provisions of Statement of Financial
            Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business

Combinations”. The purchase price was allocated to tangible and
            identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
            estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess allocated to goodwill.
            Approximately €352.3 million or $451.4 million was allocated to goodwill and
            approximately €189.4 million or $242.6 million was allocated to acquired
            intangible assets.

Of the $242.6 million of acquired intangible assets, approximately
            €168.6 million or $216.0 million was assigned to the value associated with the
            awareness and reputation of the Pullmantur brand among its passengers and is considered
            an indefinite life intangible asset. Amortizable intangible assets identified of
            approximately €20.8 million or $26.6 million have a weighted-average useful life
            of approximately 4.8 years. The amount allocated to goodwill was adjusted in 2007 by
            €20.2 million or approximately $25.9 million as a result of the finalization of
            the purchase price allocation to the net assets acquired, primarily driven by our
            completion of the fleet valuation.

Other Assets

Variable Interest Entities

Financial Accounting Standard Board Interpretation No. 46 (Revised),
            Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (“FIN 46”), addresses
            consolidation by business enterprises of Variable Interest Entities
            (“VIEs”), which are entities in which the equity investors have not
            provided enough equity to finance its activities or the equity investors (1) cannot
            directly or indirectly make decisions about the entity’s activities through their
            voting rights or similar rights; (2) do not have the obligation to absorb the expected
            losses of the entity; (3) do not have the right to receive the expected residual
            returns of the entity; or (4) have voting rights that are not proportionate to their
            economic interests and the entity’s activities involve or are conducted on behalf
            of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest.

We have determined that one of our minority interests, a ship repair
            facility in which we invested in April

2001, is a VIE; however, we are not the primary beneficiary and
            accordingly we do not consolidate this entity. As of December 31, 2007, our investment
            in this entity including equity and loans, which is also our maximum exposure to loss,
            was approximately $42.9 million.

In conjunction with our acquisition of Pullmantur, we obtained a 49%
            minority interest in Pullmantur Air, S.A. (“Pullmantur Air”), a small air
            business that operates two aircraft in support of Pullmantur Cruises’ operations.
            We have determined Pullmantur Air is a VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary and
            in accordance with FIN46, we have consolidated the assets and liabilities of Pullmantur
            Air at their fair value. The assets and liabilities of Pullmantur Air are immaterial to
            our December 31, 2007 consolidated financial statements.

Other

During 2007, we received proceeds from the repayment of $100.0 million
            of notes from TUI Travel, which we purchased in March 2006.

In July 2005, TUI Travel redeemed in full its convertible preferred
            shares. We received $348.1 million in cash, resulting in a net gain of $44.2 million,
            primarily due to foreign exchange, which was recorded as a component of other
            income.

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consists of the following (in thousands):

During 2007, we issued €1.0 billion, or approximately $1.3 billion,
            of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2014 at a price of 99.638% of par. The net
            proceeds from the offering were used to retire the €701.0 million, or
            approximately $906.5 million, outstanding balance on our unsecured bridge loan facility
            obtained to finance our acquisition of Pullmantur. The remainder of the net proceeds,
            approximately €289.0 million, or approximately $374.8 million, was used to repay a
            portion of the outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility. Also in
            2007, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively changed this fixed
            rate debt to EURIBOR-based floating rate debt, and we entered into cross currency swap
            agreements that effectively changed €300.0 million of floating EURIBOR-based debt
            to $389.1 million floating LIBOR-based debt.

During 2007, we entered into and drew in full a $589.0 million unsecured
            term loan due through 2014 at a rate of 4.215%. The proceeds were used towards the
            purchase of

Liberty of the Seas

,
            which was delivered in April 2007.

During 2007, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit
            facility to increase the amount available from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, reduce the
            effective interest rate to LIBOR plus 0.485%, change the 0.175% commitment fee to a
            0.140% facility fee and extend the maturity date from March 27, 2010 to June 29,
            2012.

Under certain of our agreements, the contractual interest rate and
            commitment fee vary with our debt rating.

The unsecured senior notes and senior debentures are not redeemable
            prior to maturity.

Our debt agreements contain covenants that require us, among other
            things, to maintain minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our net
            debt-to-capital ratio. We are in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2007.
            Following is a schedule of annual maturities on long-term debt as of December 31, 2007

Stock-Based Employee
            Compensation

As discussed in Note 2,

Summary of Significant
            Accounting Policies

, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R
            effective January 1, 2006. We have three stock-based compensation plans, which provide
            for awards to our officers, directors and key employees. The plans consist of a 1990
            Employee Stock Option Plan, a 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan and a 2000 Stock Award
            Plan. The 1990 Stock Option Plan and the 1995 Incentive Stock Option Plan terminated by
            their terms in March 2000 and February 2005, respectively. The 2000 Stock Award Plan,
            as amended, provides for the issuance of (i) incentive and non-qualified stock options,
            (ii) stock appreciation rights, (iii) restricted stock, (iv) restricted stock units and
            (v) performance shares of up to 13,000,000 shares of our common stock. During any
            calendar year, no one individual shall be granted awards of more than 500,000 shares.
            We awarded 271,594, 204,154 and 160,574 restricted stock units in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
            respectively. Options and restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2007
            vest in equal installments over four to five years from the date of grant. Generally,
            options and restricted stock units are forfeited if the recipient ceases to be a
            director or employee before the shares vest. Options are granted at a price not less
            than the fair value of the shares on the date of grant and expire not later than ten
            years after the date of grant.

In September 2006, the Compensation Committee amended the
            Company’s 2000 Stock Award Plan. The amendment extends the period during which a
            participant must exercise non-qualified options following a termination of service to
            one year. It also limits the period for exercise of both qualified and non-qualified
            options following termination of service due to a participant’s death or
            disability to one year. This amendment is effective for options granted on or after
            September 18, 2006. The amendment did not have any impact on our 2007 and 2006
            consolidated financial statements.

We also provide an Employee Stock Purchase Plan to facilitate the
            purchase by employees of up to 800,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate.
            Offerings to employees are made on a quarterly basis. Subject to certain limitations,
            the purchase price for each share of common stock is equal to 90% of the average of the
            market prices of the common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the
            first

business day of the purchase period and the last business
            day of each month of the purchase period. Shares of common stock of 20,759, 18,116 and
            14,476 were issued under the ESPP at a weighted-average price of $37.25, $36.00 and
            $40.83 during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Under an executive compensation program approved in 1994, we award to a
            trust 10,086 shares of common stock per quarter, up to a maximum of 806,880
            shares.

Total compensation expense recognized for employee stock based
            compensation for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $19.0 million, of which $16.3
            million was included within marketing, selling and administrative expenses and $2.7
            million within payroll and related expenses. Total compensation expense recognized for
            employee stock based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $18.4
            million, of which $13.8 million was included within marketing, selling and
            administrative expenses and $4.6 million within payroll and related
            expenses.

The following table illustrates the effect on income before cumulative
            effect of a change in accounting principle, net income and earnings per share as if we
            had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to such compensation for
            the year ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands, except per share data):

The fair value of each
            stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
            pricing model. The estimated fair value of stock options, less estimated forfeitures,
            is amortized

over the vesting period using the graded-vesting
            method. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as
            follows:




Dividend yield

1.3%

1.4%

1.0%

Expected stock price volatility

Risk-free interest rate

4.8%

Expected option life

5 years

5 years

Upon the adoption of SFAS 123R, expected volatility was based on a
            combination of historical and implied volatilities. The risk-free interest rate is
            based on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected
            option life assumed at the date of grant. The expected term was calculated based on
            historical experience and represents the time period options actually remain
            outstanding. We estimated forfeitures based on historical pre-vesting forfeitures and
            shall revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from
            those estimates. For purposes of calculating pro forma information for the period prior
            to fiscal 2006, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.

The intrinsic value represents

The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted was
            $12.93, $14.03 and $20.37 during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
            respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years
            ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $16.8, $22.3 and $24.9 million,
            respectively. As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately $9.3 million of total
            unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options
            granted under our stock incentive plans which is expected to be recognized over a
            weighted-average period of 1.2 years.

Restricted stock units are converted into shares of common stock upon
            vesting on a one-for-one basis. The cost of these awards is determined using the fair
            value of our common stock on the date of the grant, and compensation expense is
            recognized over the vesting period. Restricted stock activity is summarized in the
            following table:

The weighted-average estimated fair value of restricted stock units
            granted during the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $43.61 and $46.56,
            respectively.

As of December 31, 2007, we had $7.4 million of
            total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to
            restricted stock unit grants, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period
            of 1.4 years.

Note

Retirement Plan

We maintain a defined contribution pension plan covering full-time
            shoreside employees who have completed the minimum period of continuous service. Annual
            contributions to the plan are based on fixed percentages of participants’
            salaries and years of service, not to exceed certain maximums. Pension expenses were
            $15.1 million, $13.9 million and $12.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
            2006 and 2005, respectively, for the plan.

Note
            11.

Income Taxes

We and the majority of our subsidiaries are currently exempt from United
            States corporate tax on United States source income from the international operation of
            ships pursuant to Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code. Regulations under Section
            883 have limited the activities that are considered the international operation of a
            ship or incidental thereto. Accordingly, our provision for United States federal and
            state income taxes includes taxes on certain activities not considered incidental to
            the international operation of our ships.

F-19

Additionally, some of our ship-operating subsidiaries are subject to
            income tax under the tonnage tax regimes of Malta or the United Kingdom. Under these
            regimes, income from qualifying activities is not subject to corporate income tax.
            Instead, these subsidiaries are subject to a tonnage tax computed by reference to the
            tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the tax
            regimes. Income from activities not considered qualifying activities, which we do not
            considered significant, remains subject to Maltese or United Kingdom corporate income
            tax.

Income tax expense for items not qualifying under Section 883 or under
            tonnage tax regimes, and for the remainder of our subsidiaries was not significant for
            the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

We do not expect to incur income taxes on future distributions of
            undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Consequently, no deferred income taxes
            have been provided for the distribution of these earnings.

Note
            12.

Derivatives

Fair Value Hedges

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized in earnings a net loss of
            approximately $8.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively, which
            represented the total ineffectiveness of all fair value hedges. During 2007, we
            recognized a gain of approximately $21.4 million related to derivative instruments
            associated with firm commitments which no longer qualified as fair value hedges.
            The gain primarily represents changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments
            from the last date the instruments were effective to the termination of the
            instruments. These amounts are reported in other income (expense) in our consolidated
            statements of operations.

Cash Flow Hedges

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized in earnings, a net gain of
            $1.1 million, a net loss of $0.5 million and a net gain of $1.4 million, respectively,
            which represented the total ineffectiveness of all cash flow hedges. In addition, we
            recognized a gain of $1.7 million related to certain derivative instruments which were
            no longer effective as cash flow hedges. These amounts are reported in other income
            (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations.

At December 31, 2007, $59.8 million of estimated unrealized net gains
            associated with our cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified as earnings from
            other accumulated comprehensive income within the next twelve months. Reclassification
            is expected to occur primarily as the result of fuel consumption associated with our
            hedged forecasted fuel purchases. At December 31, 2007, we have hedged the variability
            in future cash flows for certain forecasted transactions occurring through the second
            half of 2011.

Hedge of Net Investment in a Foreign Operation

In 2006, in conjunction with our acquisition of
            Pullmantur Cruises, we obtained a bridge loan with a notional amount of €750.0
            million, or approximately $960.5 million, of which we drew €701.0 million, or
            approximately $925.1 million, to finance the acquisition. We designated a portion of
            this bridge loan, approximately €478.8 million, or approximately $631.8 million,
            as a nonderivative hedge of our net investment in Pullmantur Cruises and, accordingly,
            included approximately $18.7 million of foreign-currency transaction losses in the
            foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive
            loss at December 31, 2006.

In 2007, prior to repaying the bridge loan,
            we included approximately $12.7 million of foreign-currency transaction gains in
            the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other
            comprehensive loss.

F-20

Subsequent to repayment of the bridge loan, we issued
            €1.0 billion unsecured senior notes to refinance the acquisition of Pullmantur
            Cruises and to repay amounts under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. During
            2007, we designated a portion of the €1.0 billion unsecured senior notes as a
            nonderivative hedge of our net investment in Pullmantur Cruises. The designated portion
            was approximately €466.0 million, or approximately $679.9 million at December 31,
            2007. Accordingly, we included approximately $76.7 million of foreign-currency
            transaction losses related to the €1.0 billion unsecured senior notes in the
            foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive
            loss. The total net foreign currency transaction loss recorded in the foreign currency
            translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss was
            approximately $64.0 million as of December 31, 2007.

-

The reported fair values are based on a variety of factors and
            assumptions. Accordingly, the fair values may not represent actual values of the
            financial instruments that could have been realized as of December 31, 2007 or 2006, or
            that will be realized in the future and do not include expenses that could be incurred
            in an actual sale or settlement. Our financial instruments are not held for trading or
            speculative purposes.

Our exposure under foreign currency contracts, interest rate and fuel
            swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts in the event of
            non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts, all of which are currently our
            lending banks. To minimize this risk, we select counterparties with credit risks
            acceptable to us and we limit our exposure to an individual counterparty. Furthermore,
            all foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in relatively stable
            currencies.

Long-Term Debt

The fair values of our senior notes and senior debentures were estimated
            by obtaining quoted market prices. The fair values of all other debt were estimated
            using the present value of expected future cash flows.

Foreign Currency Contracts

The fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were estimated
            using the present value of expected future cash flows. Our exposure to market risk for
            fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to seven ship construction
            contracts and forecasted transactions. We use foreign currency forward contracts to
            mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December
            31, 2007, we had foreign currency forward contracts in a notional amount of €3.9
            billion maturing through 2011. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value of our foreign
            currency forward contracts was a net unrealized gain of approximately $413.7 million.
            At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was a
            net unrealized gain of approximately $

104.2

million. At
            December 31, 2007, approximately 7.7% of the aggregate cost of the ships was exposed to
            fluctuations in the euro exchange rate.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements were estimated
            based on the present value of expected future cash flows. We enter into interest rate
            swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our
            interest expense related to our long-term debt obligations.

F-21

Market risk associated with our long-term fixed rate debt is the
            potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates. As of
            December 31, 2007, we had interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value
            hedges, which exchanged fixed U.S. dollar interest rates for floating U.S. dollar
            interest rates in a notional amount of $350.0 million, maturing in 2016, and exchanged
            fixed Euro interest rates for floating Euro interest rates in a notional amount of
            €1.0 billion, maturing in 2014.

Market risk associated with our long-term floating rate debt is the
            potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates. As of
            December 31, 2007, we had an interest rate swap agreement, designated as a cash flow
            hedge, which, exchanges floating rate term debt for a fixed interest rate of 4.40% in a
            notional amount of $25.0 million, maturing in January 2008.

Fuel Swap Agreements

The fair values of our fuel swap agreements were estimated based on
            quoted market prices for similar or identical financial instruments to those we hold.
            Our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates to the forecasted
            consumption of fuel on our ships. We use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the impact of
            fluctuations in fuel prices. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had fuel swap
            agreements, designated as cash flow hedges, to pay fixed prices for fuel with an
            aggregate notional amount of $223.9 million, maturing through 2009, and $205.3 million,
            maturing through 2008, respectively.

Cross Currency Swap Agreements

The fair values of our cross currency swap agreements were estimated
            based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Our exposure to market risk
            for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to our euro-denominated
            long-term debt. As of December 31, 2007 we had cross currency swap agreements
            designated as fair value hedges with an estimated fair value of $54.0 million, maturing
            in 2014.

Other Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of all other financial instruments approximate fair
            value at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Note
            14.

Commitments and Contingencies

Capital Expenditures

As of December 31, 2007, we had one Freedom-class ship,
            two ships of a new Project Genesis class and four Solstice-class ships on order for an
            aggregate additional capacity of approximately 25,800 berths. The aggregate cost of the
            ships is approximately $7.0 billion, of which we have deposited $499.6 million as of
            December 31, 2007. (See Note 13.

Fair Value of Financial
            Instruments

).

As of December 31, 2007, we anticipated overall capital expenditures,
            including the seven ships on order, will be approximately $1.9 billion for 2008, $2.0
            billion for 2009, $2.2 billion for 2010 and $1.0 billion for 2011.

Recently we reached an agreement with Meyer Werft to build a fifth
            Solstice-class ship for Celebrity Cruises, subject to certain conditions, for an
            additional capacity of approximately 2,850 berths, expected to enter service in the
            fourth quarter of 2012. Based on current exchange rates,  we estimate the all-in
            cost of this ship will be approximately $912.0 million. This amount is not included in
            the anticipated overall capital expenditures reflected above.

Litigation

In April 2005, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the United
            States District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleging that Celebrity
            Cruises improperly requires its cabin stewards to share guest gratuities with assistant
            cabin stewards. The suit sought payment of damages, including penalty wages under the
            U.S. Seaman’s Wage Act. In March 2006, the Southern District of Florida dismissed
            the suit and held that the case should be arbitrated pursuant to the arbitration
            provision in Celebrity’s collective bargaining agreement. In June 2007, the
            United States 11th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s order
            dismissing the suit and subsequently denied the plaintiff’s petition for
            re-hearing and petition for re-hearing enbanc. In January 2008, the United States
            Supreme Court denied the plaintiff’s petition requesting that the Court grant
            certiorari jurisdiction over the action. We are not able at this time to estimate the
            impact of this proceeding on us.

F-22

In January 2006, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the
            United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that we
            infringed rights in copyrighted works and other intellectual property by presenting
            performances on our cruise ships without securing the necessary licenses. The suit
            seeks payment of damages, disgorgement of profits and a permanent injunction against
            future infringement. In April 2006, we filed a motion to sever and transfer the case to
            the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The motion is
            pending. We are not able at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding on
            us.

We have a lawsuit pending in the Circuit Court for
            Miami-Dade County, Florida against Rolls Royce, co-producer of the Mermaid
            pod-propulsion system on Millennium-class ships, for the recurring Mermaid pod
            failures. Alstom Power Conversion, the other co-producer of the pod-propulsion system,
            settled out of this suit in January 2006 for $38.0 million. The $38.0 million
            settlement resulted in a gain of $36.0 million, net of reimbursements to insurance
            companies, which we have recorded within other income in our consolidated statements of
            operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. We are not able at this time to
            estimate the outcome to us of the Rolls Royce proceeding.

Celebrity Cruises has been awarded damages in connection
            with its pending case in New York federal court against Essef Corp. for claims
            stemming from a 1994 outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease on one of Celebrity
            Cruises’ ships. The award reflects the culmination of two jury trials held
            in June 2006 and June 2007, respectively, as most recently modified by the trial judge
            in January 2008. Judgment has not yet been entered and when entered, the judgment is
            subject to appeal. The award would result in a net payment to Celebrity Cruises (after
            costs and payment to insurers) of approximately $15.0 million. We are not able at this
            time to estimate the outcome of this proceeding, and as of December 31, 2007, no amount
            of this award has been recognized in our consolidated financial
            statements.

In July 2006, a purported class action lawsuit was filed
            in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging
            that we failed to timely pay crew wages and failed to pay proper crew overtime. The
            suit seeks payment of damages, including penalty wages under the U.S. Seaman’s
            Wage Act and equitable relief damages under the California Unfair Competition Law. In
            December 2006, the District Court granted our motion to dismiss the claim and held that
            it should be arbitrated pursuant to the arbitration provision in Royal
            Caribbean’s collective bargaining agreement. In January 2007, the plaintiffs
            appealed the order to the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We are not able
            at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding.

The Miami District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
            Commission (“EEOC”) has alleged that certain of our shipboard employment
            practices do not comply with U.S. employment laws. In June 2007, the EEOC proposed
            payment of monetary sanctions and certain remedial actions. We are reviewing the matter
            with the EEOC, and no legal proceedings have been initiated. We do not believe that
            this matter will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results
            of operations.

The Office of the Attorney General for the State of
            Florida is conducting a review of our fuel supplement that we implemented in the fourth
            quarter of 2007 on our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara
            cruise brands. In addition, we have been informed that the same office is conducting an
            investigation to determine whether there is or has been a violation of state or Federal
            anti-trust laws in connection with the setting by us and other cruise line operators
            of our respective fuel supplements. We are cooperating with the Attorney
            General’s office in connection with this review and investigation. The outcome of
            this review and investigation will not have an impact to our 2007 consolidated
            financial statements. At this time, we are unable to determine the impact of this item
            on our 2008 consolidated financial statements.

F-23

In February 2008, a purported class action
            lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
            Florida. The lawsuit alleges, among other things, that we, other cruise lines and a
            trade association violated Federal anti-trust laws or state deceptive and unfair trade
            practices laws by conspiring to fix the prices of the fuel supplements announced by the
            various cruise lines or misleading consumers as to the relationship between each cruise
            line’s fuel costs and the fuel supplements it is charging its customers. We are
            not able at this time to estimate the impact of this proceeding on
            us.

We are routinely involved in other claims typical within
            the cruise vacation industry. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance. We
            believe the outcome of such claims, net of expected insurance recoveries, will not have
            a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of
            operations.

Operating Leases

In 2002, we entered into an operating lease denominated
            in British pound sterling for the

Brilliance of the
            Seas.

The lease payments vary based on sterling LIBOR. The
            lease has a contractual life of 25 years; however, the lessor has the right to cancel
            the lease at years 10 and 18. Accordingly, the lease term for accounting purposes is 10
            years. In the event of early termination at year 10, we have the option to cause the
            sale of the vessel at its fair value and use the proceeds toward the applicable
            termination obligation plus any unpaid amounts due under the contractual term of the
            lease. Alternatively, we can make a termination payment of approximately £126.0
            million, or approximately $250.3 million based on the exchange rate at December 31,
            2007, if the lease is canceled in 2012, and relinquish our right to cause the sale of
            the vessel. This is analogous to a guaranteed residual value. This termination amount,
            which is our maximum exposure, has been included in the table below for noncancelable
            operating leases. Under current circumstances we do not believe early termination of
            this lease is probable.

Under the

Brilliance of the
            Seas

operating lease, we have agreed to indemnify the lessor
            to the extent its after-tax return is negatively impacted by unfavorable changes in
            corporate tax rates, capital allowance deductions and certain unfavorable
            determinations which may be made by United Kingdom tax authorities. These
            indemnifications could result in an increase in our lease payments. We are unable to
            estimate the maximum potential increase in our lease payments due to the various
            circumstances, timing or a combination of events that could trigger such
            indemnifications. Under current circumstances we do not believe an indemnification
            under the provisions of the lease in any material amount is probable.

In addition, we are obligated under other noncancelable operating leases
            primarily for offices, warehouses and motor vehicles. As of December 31, 2007, future
            minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were as follows (in
            thousands):

Total expense for all operating leases amounted to $65.6 million, $57.0
            million and $57.9 million for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Other

Some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification
            provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events
            occur. These contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes, increased lender
            capital costs and other similar costs. The indemnification clauses are often standard
            contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business. There are no
            stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able
            to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these
            indemnification clauses. We have not been required to make any payments under such
            indemnification clauses in the past and, under current circumstances, we do not believe
            an indemnification in any material amount is probable.

F-24

If any person other than A. Wilhelmsen AS. and Cruise Associates, our
            two principal shareholders, acquires ownership of more than 30% of our common stock and
            our two principal shareholders, in the aggregate, own less of our common stock than
            such person and do not collectively have the right to elect, or to designate for
            election, at least a majority of the board of directors, we may be obligated to prepay
            indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities, which we may be
            unable to replace on similar terms. If this were to occur, it could have an adverse
            impact on our liquidity and operations.

At December 31, 2007, we have future commitments to pay for our usage of
            certain port facilities, marine consumables, services and maintenance contracts as
            follows (in thousands):

Related Parties

A. Wilhelmsen AS. and Cruise Associates collectively own approximately
            35.7% of our common stock and are parties to a shareholders’ agreement which
            provides that our board of directors will consist of four nominees of A. Wilhelmsen
            AS., four nominees of Cruise Associates and our Chief Executive Officer. They have the
            power to determine, among other things, our policies and the policies of our
            subsidiaries and actions requiring shareholder approval.

Subsequent Events

In February 2008, we entered into a $530.0 million
            unsecured term loan due through 2015. We have elected to have the entire loan amount
            bear interest at LIBOR plus the then applicable margin. We intend to use the proceeds
            of the loan towards the purchase of

Independence of the
