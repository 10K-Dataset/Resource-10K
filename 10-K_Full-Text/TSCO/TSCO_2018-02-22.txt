PART I

Item 1

.

Business

Overview

Tractor Supply Company (the “Company” or “we”) is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States (“U.S.”).  The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the “

Out Here

” lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  We operate retail stores under the names

Tractor Supply Company, Del’s Feed & Farm Supply

and

Petsense

and operate websites under the names

TractorSupply.com

and

Petsense.com

.  Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.

Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment which is the retail sale of products that support the rural lifestyle.  At

December 30, 2017

, we operated

1,853

retail stores in


states (

1,685

Tractor Supply and Del’s retail stores and


Petsense retail stores).  Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from

15,000

to

20,000

square feet of inside selling space, along with additional outside selling space, and our Petsense stores have approximately 5,500 square feet of inside selling space.  For Tractor Supply retail locations, we use a standard design for most new built-to-suit locations that includes approximately

15,500

square feet of inside selling space.

Business Strategy

We believe our sales and earnings growth is the result of executing our business strategy, which includes the following key components:

Market Niche

We have identified a specialized market niche: supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  By focusing our product assortment on these core customers, we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise, home center and other specialty retailers.  We cater to the rural lifestyle and often serve a market by being a trip consolidator for many basic maintenance needs for farm, ranch and rural customers.

Customers

Our target customers are home, land, pet and livestock owners who generally have above average income and below average cost of living.  We seek to serve a customer base that primarily lives in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.  This customer base includes recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.

Customer Service

We are committed to providing our customers reliable product availability and a high level of in-store service through our motivated, well-trained store team members. We believe the ability of our store team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps our customers find the right products to satisfy their everyday needs as well as the specialty items needed to complete their rural lifestyle projects.  We also engage with our customers through our e-commerce website (

TractorSupply.com

), which provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information, research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.   Additionally, we maintain a customer solutions center at our Store Support Center located in Brentwood, Tennessee to support our in-store and online customers as well as our store team members.  We believe this commitment to customer service promotes strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping.

We use a third-party provider to measure our level of customer service.  This process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience.  Based on the third-party provider’s data, we believe our customer satisfaction scores to be among the best-in-class.  We carefully evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at the individual store level based on that feedback.


Index

Store Personnel and Training

We seek to hire store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds, with particular emphasis on general maintenance, equine and welding.  We endeavor to staff our stores with courteous, highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members, often in cooperation with our vendors.  Our training programs include:

•

a thorough on-boarding process to prepare new team members for their new role;

•

productive workplace environment training that is intended to educate team members on company policies and procedures covering topics such as harassment, discrimination, and retaliation;

•

new store opening training that prepares our store managers to open new stores to Company standards;

•

a management training program which covers all aspects of our store operations, delivering superior service and managing the team member experience;

•

structured training on customer service and selling skills;

•

online product knowledge training produced in conjunction with key vendors;

•

leadership development programs that prepare leaders to expand their current contributions; and

•

an annual store manager meeting with vendor product presentations.

Store Environment

Our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies.  Stores are strategically arranged to provide an open environment for optimal product placement and visual display.  In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily re-allocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions.  Display and product placement information is routinely sent to stores to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores.  Informative signs are located in key product categories to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.  These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing, useful information regarding product benefits, and suggestions for appropriate accessories.  Our store layouts and visual displays are designed to provide our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhance the shopping experience.  Also, our store team members wear highly visible red vests, aprons or smocks with nametags, and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located near the front of the store.

Merchandising and Purchasing

We offer an extensive assortment of products for those seeking to enjoy the “

Out Here”

lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  Our product assortment is tailored to meet the needs of our customers in various geographic markets. Our full line of product offerings includes a broad selection of high quality, reputable brand name and exclusive brand products and is supported by a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of

15,500

to

20,000

products per store.  No one product accounted for more than

10%

of our sales during


.  Our comprehensive selection of merchandise is comprised of the following major product categories:

•

Equine, livestock, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment;

•

Hardware, truck, towing and tool products;

•

Seasonal products, including heating, lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys;

•

Work/recreational clothing and footwear; and

•

Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use.

The following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal


,


and


:

Our buying team continuously reviews and updates our product assortment to respond to customer needs and to offer new, relevant products.  We are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance


Index

needs with emphasis on consumable, usable, and edible (“C.U.E.”) products.  Examples of C.U.E. product categories include, but are not limited to, livestock feed and bedding, pet food, lubricants, and various seasonal products, such as heating, pest control and twine.

Our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors.  Our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors.  We purchase our products from a group of approximately


vendors, with no one vendor representing more than

10%

of our purchases during fiscal


.  Approximately


core vendors accounted for

90%

of our merchandise purchases during fiscal


.  We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products, and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products.  We have no material long-term contractual commitments with any of our product vendors.

Our buying teams focus on merchandise procurement, vendor line reviews and testing of new products and programs.  We also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on forecasting and inventory replenishment, a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning and a specialized pricing team that seeks to optimize market-specific pricing for our products.  Through the combined efforts of these teams, we continue to focus on improving our overall inventory productivity and in-stock position.

Intellectual Property

Our subsidiary, Tractor Supply Co. of Texas, LP (“TSCT”), owns registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for various service marks including

TSC

®

,

Tractor Supply Co.

®

,

TSC Tractor Supply Co.

®

and the trapezium design for retail store services. We consider these service marks, and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition, to be valuable assets of our business. TSCT also owns several other service marks for retail services, some of which have been registered with the USPTO and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO.

In addition to selling products that bear nationally-known manufacturer brands, we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business.  These exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands, which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination store.

Our exclusive brands represented approximately

32%

of our total sales in both fiscal


and


and

31%

in fiscal


.  Our exclusive brands include:

The exclusive brands identified above have been registered as trademarks with the USPTO for certain products and are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO for other products.

Our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates; however, provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner, the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration.

We believe our intellectual property, which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above, together with certain trade names, domain names, patents and copyrights, has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies.


Index

Distribution

We currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise and delivering product ordered through

TractorSupply.com

.  In fiscal


, our Tractor Supply stores received approximately

74%

of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly to the stores from our vendors or directly to our customers.  We believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise in order to enhance in-stocks, minimize freight costs and improve the inventory turn rate.  Our distribution facilities, located in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, Texas, and Washington, represent total distribution capacity of

5.0 million

square feet.  In fiscal 2017, we began construction on a new northeast distribution center in Frankfort, New York, as well as an expansion of our existing distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska, which will provide additional distribution capacity once construction is completed.

We select the locations of our distribution facilities in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution facilities to our stores.  Our distribution centers utilize warehouse and labor management tools that support the planning, control and processing of inventory. We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a transportation management system.  We utilize multiple common carriers for store and direct to customer deliveries. We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, the monitoring of transportation routes, and the scheduling of deliveries.

Marketing

We utilize an “everyday value price” philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year.  To drive store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars, customer targeted direct mail as well as e-mail, digital and social media initiatives.  In addition, our Neighbor’s Club loyalty program enhances our ability to create engagement with our best customers.

Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions and honoring coupons.  Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, brochures, support for in-store events and point-of-purchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members.

Omni-Channel

We connect with our customers in their manner of choosing, whether that is in store, on our e-commerce website (

TractorSupply.com

), e-mail, social media, direct mail or through our customer solutions center.  Our goal is to be available anytime, anywhere and in any way our customers choose to engage with our brand.  We provide our customers the opportunity to shop in a manner that fits their lifestyle and is most convenient for them.  We offer an expansive product assortment, search capabilities and information that is relevant for their lifestyle.  We provide our customers the ability to have products shipped direct to our retail stores, their homes or offices.  We maintain two fulfillment centers within our distribution center network to support our e-commerce activities.  In 2017, we completed the expansion of our buy online and pick up in store program which provides convenient customer pick up in our store locations.  We also began providing additional convenience through flexible payment options and simplified checkout.  We are focused on delivering an enhanced mobile and tablet experience, improving the site response time and expanding our product offerings for vendor direct to customer shipments, allowing us to serve our customers at any time. Digital capabilities have further enhanced customer service and allowed us to target markets outside of our current retail store locations.

Management and Team Members

As of

December 30, 2017

, we employed approximately

14,000

full-time and

14,000

part-time Tractor Supply team members. We also employ additional part-time team members during peak periods.  We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.

At the end of fiscal


, our store operations were organized into ten regions.  Each region is led by a regional vice president, and the region is further organized into districts, each of which is led by a district manager.  We have two internal advisory boards, one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers.  These groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chain-wide endorsement of proposed best-practice solutions.

All of our team members participate in one of various bonus incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company performance.  In addition to bonus incentive programs, we provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan.  We also share in the cost of health insurance provided to eligible team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased from the Company.

We encourage a promote-from-within environment when internal resources permit.  We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to prepare our high-potential team members for greater responsibility.  Our current team of district managers and store managers have an average tenure of approximately nine and six years, respectively.  We believe internal


Index

promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned growth.

Continuous Improvement

We are committed to a continuous improvement program to drive change throughout our organization.  Using data analytics and team member engagement, we examine business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs, drive innovation, and improve effectiveness.  We have implemented numerous continuous improvement projects (with team members from multiple areas of our business) to evaluate key operations and implement process changes.  Team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes.  Our management encourages the participation of all team members in decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.

Management Information and Control Systems

We have invested resources in management information and control systems to provide legendary customer service.   This includes use of digital technologies to integrate the customer experience in store, online, and through our customer solutions center, offering customers the ability to shop anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose. Our key platforms include a point-of-sale system, in-store mobility and digital technology system, an e-commerce platform, a supply chain management and replenishment system, a transportation management system, warehouse and labor management tools, a price optimization system, a vendor purchase order control system, a merchandise presentation system, and a customer loyalty system.  These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.

We continue to invest in technology to support store, online, and distribution facility expansion.  We also continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness.  Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance. We plan to continue to invest in information technology and implement efficiency-driving system enhancements, as well as evaluate use of technologies to improve productivity such as artificial intelligence, automation software, and other technologies. We also maintain and continue to strengthen the security of our information systems to help protect and prevent unauthorized access to personal information of our customers, employees and vendors or other confidential Company data.  Collectively, these efforts are directed toward improving business processes, maintaining secure, efficient and stable systems, and enabling the continued growth and success of our business.

Petsense

Petsense is a small-box pet specialty supply retailer focused on meeting the needs of pet owners, primarily in small and mid-sized communities, and offering a variety of pet products and services.  At December 30, 2017, we operated a total of 168 Petsense stores in 26 states, with


full-time and


part-time team members, and an e-commerce website (

Petsense.com

).  The Petsense name is registered with the USPTO.

Growth Strategy

Tractor Supply believes we can grow our business by being the most dependable supplier of relevant products and services for the “

Out Here

” lifestyle, creating customer loyalty through personalized experiences and providing convenience that our customers expect at anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose.  Our long-term growth strategy is to: (1) drive profitable growth through new store openings and by expanding omni-channel capabilities, thus tying together our website product content, social media, digital and online shopping experience, attracting new customers and driving loyalty, (2) build customer-centric engagement by leveraging analytics to deliver legendary customer service, seasoned advice and personalized experiences, (3) offer relevant assortments and services across all channels through exclusive and national brands and continue to introduce new products through our test and learn strategy, (4) enhance our core and foundational capabilities by investing in infrastructure and process improvements which will support growth, scale and agility while improving the customer experience, and (5) expand through selective acquisitions, as such opportunities arise, to add complementary businesses and to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to supplement organic growth.

Achieving this strategy will require a foundational focus on: (1) organizing, optimizing and empowering our team members for growth by developing skills, talent and leadership across the organization, and (2) implementing operational efficiency initiatives to align our cost structure to support new business capabilities for margin improvement and cost reductions.

Over the past five years, we have experienced considerable sales growth, resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately

9.2%

. We plan to open approximately


new Tractor Supply and


new Petsense stores in fiscal


, a selling square footage increase of approximately

5.0%

.  In fiscal


, we opened


new Tractor Supply stores and

Index

stores.  In fiscal 2016, we opened


new Tractor Supply stores and began operating 143 Petsense stores.  This represents a selling square footage increase of approximately

6.3%

during fiscal


and

10.8%

during fiscal


.

At

December 30, 2017

, we operated

1,853

retail stores in


states (

1,685

Tractor Supply and Del’s retail stores and


Petsense retail stores). Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately


additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores. We also believe that there is opportunity for up to 1,000 Petsense stores.  Approximately

40%

of our Tractor Supply stores are in freestanding buildings and

60%

are located in strip shopping centers.  We lease approximately

93%

of our stores and own the remaining

7%

.

Competition

We operate in a competitive retail industry. The principal competitive factors include location of stores, fulfillment options, price, quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, product knowledge and customer service. We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.  However, we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.  See further discussion of competition in 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Seasonality and Weather

Our business is seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season, and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold-weather selling season.  We believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves, not the quarters, due to the fact that different weather patterns from year-to-year can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters, particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters.

Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations. In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and droughts, have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and length of these conditions.  Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.

Stewardship and Compliance with Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, enacted or adopted, regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.  We are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  We are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company.  This commitment is demonstrated through our Stewardship Program, which is our environmental sustainability program.  Through this program, the Company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment.  These initiatives include the installation of energy management systems, LED lighting, high efficiency heating/air conditioning systems in our stores, and recycling programs in our stores, distribution facilities and the Store Support Center.  Our Store Support Center, opened in 2014, and our distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona, opened in 2015, were each awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification for environmentally sustainable design, construction and operation.  We also installed solar arrays at the Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee and our store in Hendersonville, Tennessee.

Risk Factors

Our business faces many risks.  Those risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below.  If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.  These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K.

General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.

Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. A weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels, uncertainty or changes in business or political conditions, higher interest rates, higher tax rates, higher fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors.  A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending, shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales, slower inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.

Failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name.

Our success depends in part on the value and strength of the Tractor Supply name.  The Tractor Supply name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business.  Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent, high quality customer experience.  Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity.  Failure to comply or accusation of failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, data privacy, and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions.  Any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business.

We may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores.

We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales, defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months.  Various factors affect comparable store sales, including the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise assortment, competition, proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other retailers, increased presence of online retailers, current economic conditions, customer satisfaction with our products, the timing of promotional events, the release of new merchandise, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions.  These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.  Past comparable store sales are not an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future.

Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.

Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.  We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton and other commodities as well as diesel fuel and transportation services.  Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.  Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality.  Should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.

Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.

Weather conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.  Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations.  In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain and


Index

droughts, have impacted operating results.  While extreme weather conditions can positively impact our operating results by increasing demand in affected locations for products needed to cope with the weather condition and its effects, they can also negatively affect our business depending on the severity and length of these conditions as a result of store closings or the inability of customers to shop at our stores due to weather conditions.  Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.  Should such a strategy not be effective, the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our merchandising and marketing initiatives may not provide expected results.

We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs.  These merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results, and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations.  If we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful, we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory price reductions that have a material adverse effect on our profitability.  Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse impact on operating results and financial condition.

Capital required for growth may not be available.

The construction or acquisition of new stores, store support center facilities, distribution facilities or other facilities, the remodeling and renovation of existing facilities and investments in information technology require significant amounts of capital.  In the past, our growth has been funded through internally generated cash flow and bank borrowings.  Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.  Our access to funds under our debt facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.  Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.  In addition, tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions.  Unfavorable lending practices could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations.

Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced funding alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.  Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.  Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, cash dividends or other discretionary uses of cash.

Failure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.

An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings. This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers for such sites.  If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly. To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.

As we execute this expansion strategy, we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales, profitability or cash flow.  Our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems, the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems, the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel (especially store managers), the effectiveness of our controls and procedures, and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.

Although we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process, there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the Company. New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our more mature stores. As we continue to open new stores, there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs.


Index

Our failure to attract and retain qualified team members, increases in wage and labor costs and changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance.

Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.  Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs, changes in employment legislation and the potential for changes in local labor practices or union activities.  If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.

We are subject to federal, state, and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions.  These laws cover wage and hour practices, labor relations, paid and family leave, workplace safety and immigration, among others.  The laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level create unique challenges for a multi-state employer.  We must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations.  If our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly as new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented, our financial performance could be adversely affected.

We may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.

We may, from time to time, acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business.  The success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the target business.  Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfully integrate an organization that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Also, while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, the new businesses may not meet our expectations and, therefore, adversely affect our financial performance.

Competition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.

We operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors.  These competitors include general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.  We compete for customers, merchandise, real estate locations, and employees.  This competitive environment subjects us to various other risks, including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability.  Our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance.

We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.

The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.  We have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.  Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors.  We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no long-term contracts with such suppliers.  Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.  This reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution.  Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.

While the Company selects these third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, and cyber attacks or security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business.

We rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.  In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.  As an importer, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally, such as domestic and foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.  If any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional


Index

U.S. quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The current political landscape in the U.S. has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries.  We source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the U.S., primarily in Asia and Central America.  Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.

A significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits.

We rely on our distribution and transportation network to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, air, rail and truck.  Any disruption, unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could affect store operations negatively.  For example, unexpected delivery delays (including delays due to weather, fuel shortages or other reasons) or increases in transportation costs (including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments) could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate product for sale, or products at a desired price, resulting in lower sales and profitability.  In addition, labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business.  Also, a fire, tornado, or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving, processing and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business.

The implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.

We maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new facilities and expand existing facilities to support our growth objectives. Delays in opening new or expanded distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth, which may in turn reduce revenue growth.  In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials; shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases.  The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons.  We cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets.

We continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain.  These initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores and distribution facilities in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.  The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether.

We are subject to personal injury, workers’ compensation, product liability, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and other claims in the ordinary course of business.

Our business involves a risk of personal injury, workers’ compensation, product liability, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and other claims in the ordinary course of business.  Product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or write-off of merchandise inventories, the incurrence of fines or penalties and damage to our reputation.  We maintain general liability and workers’ compensation insurance with a self-insured retention for each policy type and a deductible for each occurrence.  We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage.  In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance as well as the property owners of our leased buildings.  Our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers, manufacturers and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim.  No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ or landlords’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.

Additionally, we are subject to U.S. federal, state and local employment laws that expose us to potential liability if we are determined to have violated such employment laws, including but not limited to, laws pertaining to minimum wage rates, overtime pay,


Index

discrimination, harassment, and wrongful termination.  Compliance with these laws, including the remediation of any alleged violation, may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal

control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, employees and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, employees and vendors, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

We receive certain personal and other confidential information about our customers, employees and vendors.  We also rely on business partners to provide services to us that may include important business information or data about our customers, employees and vendors.  In addition, our online operations at

TractorSupply.com

and

Petsense.com

depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.  While we maintain substantial security measures to help protect and prevent unauthorized access to such information, it is possible that unauthorized parties (through cybersecurity attacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might compromise our security measures and obtain and misuse the personal information of customers, employees and vendors that we hold or other confidential Company data.  It is possible that such a compromise could go undetected by us.  Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage.  Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the breach and could result in a disruption of our operations.

In addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations relating to data breaches and theft of employee and customer data.  These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.

Our business and operations could suffer material losses in the event of system interruptions or failures.

Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the operation and administration of our business.  These systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including, but not limited to, human error, cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, fire, flood, power outages, telecommunication failures, facility or equipment damage, natural disasters, terrorism, and war.  In addition, we continually make investments in technology to implement new processes and systems as well as to maintain and update our existing processes and systems.  Implementing process and system changes increases the risk of disruption.  If our information technology systems are interrupted or fail and our redundant systems or recovery plans are not adequate to address such interruptions or failures on a timely basis, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.

As customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our sales and marketing strategy, the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences.

Through our continued information technology enhancements, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and an omni-channel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices.  We use our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales.  Omni-channel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers.


Index

If we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our strategic business initiatives may not be successful.

We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.  We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business.  We could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely.  We could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand our management information systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.

The success of our strategic business initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin is dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them.   Extended delays or cost overruns in securing, developing and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the strategic business initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives.

We cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program.

Although our Board of Directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our Board of Directors’ continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend.  Furthermore, although our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion through December 2020, we may discontinue this program at any time or significantly reduce repurchases under the program.

The market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value.

The price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts’ or investors’ expectations, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.  The Company’s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay.  That multiple is in part dependent on investors’ perception of the Company’s future earnings growth prospects.  If investor perceptions of the Company’s earnings growth prospects change, the Company’s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected.

In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.

Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of federal, state, local or foreign laws and regulations.

We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and governmental regulations including those relating to environmental protection, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security and employment law matters. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributors, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs. In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.

We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions.  Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar laws could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Potential noncompliance with environmental regulations could materially impact our results of operations or financial condition.

Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health, including, for example, regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters.  Governmental agencies on the federal, state and local levels have, in recent years, increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations, and have at times pursued enforcement activities.  We periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies, which are addressed on a case-by-case basis with the relevant agency.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.


Index

Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by legislative tax reform, changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws, or interpretations thereof.  Additionally, our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates or by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.

We are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), as well as state and local taxing authorities. Like many retailers, a portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.  These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance. Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.

The following is a list of distribution locations including the approximate square footage and if the location is leased or owned:

(a)

The leased facility in Hagerstown is treated as an extension of the existing owned Hagerstown location and is not considered a separate distribution center.

(b)

This is a mixing center designed to process certain high-volume bulk products.

The Company’s Store Support Center occupies approximately 260,000 square feet of owned building space in Brentwood, Tennessee, and the Company’s Merchandising Innovation Center occupies approximately 32,000 square feet of leased building space in Nashville, Tennessee.  The Company also leases approximately 8,000 square feet of building space for the Petsense corporate headquarters located in Scottsdale, Arizona.

In fiscal 2017, we began construction on a new northeast distribution center in Frankfort, New York, as well as an expansion of our existing distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska, which will provide additional distribution capacity once construction is completed.

Legal Proceedings

Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental legal proceedings if the proceeding reasonably involves potential monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. We periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies, which are addressed on a case-by-case basis with the relevant agency. The Company received a subpoena from the District Attorney of Yolo County, California, requesting records and information regarding its hazardous waste management and disposal practices in California.  The Company and the Office of the District Attorney of Yolo County engaged in settlement discussions which resulted in the settlement of the matter.  A consent decree reflecting the terms of settlement was filed with the Yolo County Superior Court on June 23, 2017.  Under the settlement, the Company agreed to a compliance plan and also agreed to pay a civil penalty and fund supplemental environmental projects furthering consumer protection and environmental enforcement in California.  The civil penalty did not differ materially from the amount accrued.  The cost of the settlement and the compliance with the consent decree will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company is also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided for in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.  Accordingly, the Company currently expects these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We expect to implement the balance of the repurchase program through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with regulations of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements.  The timing and amount of any common stock repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability and other market conditions.

Any additional stock repurchase programs will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.  The program may be limited or terminated at any time, without prior notice.

Selected Financial Data

FIVE YEAR SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS

(a)(b)

The following selected financial data is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements of Tractor Supply Company and provides summary historical financial information for the fiscal periods

ended and as of the dates indicated

(in thousands, except per share amounts and selected operating and other data):

(a)

Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.  References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.  Fiscal year 2016 consisted of 53 weeks while all other fiscal years presented consisted of 52 weeks.

(b)

Beginning in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, selected financial and operating information includes the consolidation of Petsense, unless otherwise noted.

(c)

Basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding applied to net income.  Diluted net income per share is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.

(d)

Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales. Beginning in fiscal 2015, stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.  This change in the calculation methodology did not have a material impact on the comparable store metrics reported in prior periods presented due to the minimal number of stores closed in those periods.  Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics. If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.  Acquired Petsense stores are considered comparable stores beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

(e)

New stores sales metrics are based on stores open for less than one year.

(f)

Assumes average inventory cost, excluding inventory in-transit.

(g)

Working capital for 2017, 2016 and 2015 reflects deferred tax assets as non-current as a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-17 (which is discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Years prior to 2015 have not been adjusted to reflect the adoption of this guidance.

(h)

Long-term debt includes amounts outstanding under the Company’s debt facilities and capital lease obligations, excluding the current portions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the three-year period ended

December 30, 2017

(our fiscal years


,


and


).  This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.  This discussion contains forward-looking statements.  See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this report.

Tractor Supply reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Tractor Supply also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, Tractor Supply’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Overview

Founded in 1938, Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States (“U.S.”).  The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the “

Out Here

” lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  As of

December 30, 2017

, we operated

1,853

retail stores in


states under the names

Tractor Supply Company,

Del’s Feed & Farm Supply

and

Petsense.

We also operate websites under the names

TractorSupply.com

and

Petsense.com

.  Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:

•

Equine, livestock, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment;

•

Hardware, truck, towing and tool products;

•

Seasonal products, including heating, lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys;

•

Work/recreational clothing and footwear; and

•

Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use.

Tractor Supply believes we can grow our business by being the most dependable supplier of relevant products and services for the “

Out Here

” lifestyle, creating customer loyalty through personalized experiences and providing convenience that our customers expect at anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose.  Our long-term growth strategy is to: (1) drive profitable growth through new store openings and by expanding omni-channel capabilities, thus tying together our website product content, social media, digital and online shopping experience, attracting new customers and driving loyalty, (2) build customer-centric engagement by leveraging analytics to deliver legendary customer service, seasoned advice and personalized experiences, (3) offer relevant assortments and services across all channels through exclusive and national brands and continue to introduce new products through our test and learn strategy, (4) enhance our core and foundational capabilities by investing in infrastructure and process improvements which will support growth, scale and agility while improving the customer experience, and (5) expand through selective acquisitions, as such opportunities arise, to add complementary businesses and to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to supplement organic growth.

Achieving this strategy will require a foundational focus on: (1) organizing, optimizing and empowering our team members for growth by developing skills, talent and leadership across the organization, and (2) implementing operational efficiency initiatives to align our cost structure to support new business capabilities for margin improvement and cost reductions.

Over the past five years, we have experienced considerable growth in stores, growing from 1,176 stores at the end of


to

1,853

stores (

1,685

Tractor Supply and Del’s retail stores and


Petsense retail stores) at the end of fiscal


, and in sales, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately

9.2%

. Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets.  We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately


additional opportunities for new Tractor Supply stores.  We also believe that there is opportunity for up to 1,000 Petsense stores.

Executive Summary

In


, we opened


new Tractor Supply stores in 39 states and


new Petsense stores in 11 states.  In 2016, we opened


new Tractor Supply stores and began operating 143 Petsense stores.  This resulted in a selling square footage increase of approximately

Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax asset resulting in a one-time, non-cash charge of approximately $4.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 was $427.5 million, or $3.33 per diluted share.

We ended the year with

$109.1 million

in cash and outstanding debt of $426.1 million, after returning

$503.2 million

to our stockholders through stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.  In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.  Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.

Fiscal


Compared to Fiscal


Net sales

increased

7.0%

to

$7.26 billion

in fiscal


from

$6.78 billion

in fiscal


.  The prior year included an extra sales week as a part of the Company’s 53-week calendar in 2016, which negatively impacted the overall sales increase by approximately 1.6 percentage points.  Comparable store sales for fiscal


were

$6.85 billion

, a

2.7%

increase

over fiscal


.  This compares to a

1.6%

comparable store sales increase in the prior year.  The comparable store transaction count

increased

2.2%

and comparable store average ticket increased

0.5%

for fiscal


.

Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.  Stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.  Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.  If the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.  Acquired Petsense stores are considered comparable beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.

The comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the year-round strength of consumable, usable and edible ("C.U.E.") products, primarily animal- and pet-related merchandise.  Warmer than normal weather patterns early in the first quarter negatively impacted the sales of winter seasonal items and winter storms in March had an unfavorable impact on the start to the spring selling season.  Beginning in the second quarter, we experienced broad-based improvement through the remainder of the year in all geographic regions and major product categories driven by strength in sales of everyday basic items in C.U.E. and year-round products.  The third quarter experienced an additional benefit from an extended spring and summer selling season and strong sales of emergency response products related to hurricanes during the quarter while the fourth quarter experienced an additional benefit from solid sales in cold weather and other seasonal products.

In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal


, sales from stores opened less than one year, including Petsense, were

$405.0 million

in fiscal


compared to

$2.33 billion

in fiscal


.  As a percent of net sales, gross margin remained flat to prior year at

34.3%

.  Gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by higher markdowns on cold weather merchandise and targeted promotional activity in the first quarter, as well as a higher freight expense throughout the year due to higher carrier costs, increased average fuel costs and a shift in product mix towards more freight intensive products. These declines in gross margin were offset by strong sell-through rates and solid price and inventory management, particularly in the back half of the year.

Total selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for fiscal


increased

10.7%

to

$1.81 billion

from

$1.63 billion

in fiscal


.  SG&A expenses, as a percent of net sales,

increased


basis points to

24.9%

in fiscal


from

24.1%

in fiscal


.  The increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to higher store payroll from wage inflation and our continued effort to enhance customer service, increased incentive compensation at the store level from the strong year-over-year growth in comparable store sales, the deleverage of occupancy and other fixed costs resulting from the integration of Petsense expenses and the 53

rd

week of sales in fiscal 2016 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2017, and investments in infrastructure and technology to support our strategic long-term growth initiatives.

Our effective tax rate

increased

to

37.2%

for fiscal


compared to

36.5%

in fiscal


.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, a reduction of the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We have made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the Act on our existing deferred tax balances as of December 30, 2017, and recognized a provisional amount of $4.9 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances in future periods.  Excluding the impacts of the Act, our effective income tax rate in 2017 would have been 36.4%.

For fiscal


, net income was

$422.6 million

, or

$3.30

per diluted share, compared to

$437.1 million

per diluted share, in fiscal


.  Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax asset resulting in a one-time, non-cash charge of approximately $4.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 was $427.5 million, or $3.33 per diluted share.  Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure which has been provided in order to enhance comparability for the periods presented.

Fiscal


Compared to Fiscal


Net sales increased 8.9% to $6.78 billion in fiscal 2016 from $6.23 billion in fiscal 2015.  The fourth quarter included an extra sales week as a part of the Company’s 53-week calendar in 2016, which represented 1.6 percentage points of the overall 8.9% sales increase over prior year.  Comparable store sales for fiscal 2016 were $6.41 billion, a 1.6% increase over fiscal 2015. This compares to a 3.1% comparable store sales increase in the prior year. The comparable store transaction count increased 2.6%, while comparable store average ticket decreased 0.9% for fiscal 2016.

Comparable store metrics are calculated on an annual basis using sales generated from all stores open at least one year and all online sales, excluding certain adjustments to net sales.  Stores closed during the year are removed from our comparable store metrics calculations.  Stores relocated during the years being compared are not removed from our comparable store metrics.  If


Index

the effect of relocated stores on our comparable store metrics becomes material, we would remove relocated stores from the calculations.  Petsense stores are not considered comparable stores until 12 months after the date of acquisition.

The comparable store sales increase was driven by an increase in traffic counts and the year-round strength of C.U.E. products, principally animal- and pet-related merchandise. Livestock equipment and hardline products such as fencing and trailers also performed well throughout the year.  The full year sales performance was negatively impacted by unpredictable weather patterns during the spring selling season and unseasonably warm weather in the key cold months of the year which drove softness in cold weather seasonal categories and big ticket items such as log splitters and stoves.  Additionally, the Company believes that economic conditions in the energy producing markets negatively impacted consumer spending primarily in the Midwest and South Central regions.

In addition to comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2016, sales from stores opened less than one year, including Petsense, were $378.9 million in fiscal 2016, which represented 6.1 percentage points of the 8.9% increase over fiscal 2015 net sales.  Sales from stores opened less than one year were $351.0 million in fiscal 2015, which represented 6.1 percentage points of the 9.0% increase over fiscal 2014 net sales.

The following table summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2016 and 2015:

The following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2016 and 2015:

Gross profit increased 8.5% to $2.33 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $2.14 billion in fiscal 2015.  As a percent of net sales, gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 34.3% for fiscal 2016 compared to 34.4% for fiscal 2015.  This decrease in gross margin percentage principally reflects a higher mix of C.U.E. products, which generally carry below chain average gross margin, partially offset by benefits from our key margin driving initiatives.  Freight expense as a percent of net sales experienced a marginal increase in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year due principally to an increase in inbound miles and domestic transportation costs, partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices and import container costs.

SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percent of net sales increased 10 basis points to 24.1% in fiscal 2016 from 24.0% in fiscal 2015.  SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales increased due to incremental costs associated with our


Index

new distribution facilities that began operations in late fiscal 2015, as well as acquisition and operating expenses associated with the Petsense purchase.  These increases were partially offset by leverage of occupancy costs from the 53

rd

week of sales in fiscal 2016, as well as lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense.  Total SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, for fiscal 2016 increased 9.3% to $1.63 billion from $1.49 billion in fiscal 2015.  The increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflects new store growth, incremental costs from operating the new distribution facilities, variable costs associated with our comparable store sales growth and the extra sales week during the year and incremental expenses associated with the Petsense acquisition and its operations.

Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.5% for fiscal 2016 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2015.  The decrease in the effective income tax rate was due principally to the availability of federal and state tax incentives.

As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2016 increased 6.5% to $437.1 million, or $3.27 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $410.4 million, or $3.00 per diluted share, in fiscal 2015.

During fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock at a total cost of $331.7 million as part of our $3 billion share repurchase program.  In fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares at a total cost of $292.7 million.

Fiscal 2018 Outlook

Our guidance for fiscal


anticipates net sales of $7.69 billion to $7.77 billion, reflecting a comparable store sales increase of 2.0% to 3.0% as well as the opening of approximately


Tractor Supply stores and 20 Petsense stores.  At the mid-point of our guidance range, we anticipate that operating profit as a percentage of net sales will decrease from 9.4% in fiscal 2017 to 8.8% in fiscal 2018.  Included in this estimate are anticipated cost pressures associated with rising diesel fuel prices and transportation costs, wage investments for our team members in our stores and distribution centers, investments to support our growth strategy, and incremental pre-opening and other operating expenses from our new distribution center which is currently under construction in Frankfort, New York.  Lastly, as a result of the Act reducing the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 is expected to range from 23.0% to 23.5%.  As a result of the foregoing factors, we estimate net income for fiscal 2018 of $490 million to $515 million, or $3.95 to $4.15 per diluted share.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, distribution facility capacity and improvements, information technology, inventory purchases, repayment of

existing borrowings under our debt facilities, share repurchases, cash dividends and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise.

Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, cash provided from operations, remaining funds available under our debt facilities, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.  Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively.

We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, funds available under our debt facilities, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations and distribution facility capacity, through the end of fiscal 2018.

In comparison to

December 31, 2016

, working capital as of

December 30, 2017

was impacted most significantly by changes in our cash, inventory and accounts payable.

•

The cash balance increased primarily due to strong inventory turns at the end of fiscal 2017 stemming from the sale of cold weather seasonal merchandise.

•

The

increase

in inventory resulted from the purchase of additional inventory to support new store growth.  We actively manage our inventory balances and in-stock levels at our stores.  Average inventory per store decreased slightly year-over-year principally due to an improvement in inventory turns of seasonal and cold-weather merchandise at the end of fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.

Proceeds from the 2016 Senior Credit Facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and other matters.  There are

no

compensating balance requirements associated with the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.

Covenants and Default Provisions of the Debt Agreements

The 2016 Senior Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement (collectively, the “Debt Agreements”) require quarterly compliance with respect to

two

material covenants:  a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.  Both ratios are calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis at the end of each fiscal quarter. The fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and rent expense (“consolidated EBITDAR”) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments).  The fixed charge coverage ratio shall be greater than or equal to

2.00

to

1.0

as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  The leverage ratio compares rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments) multiplied by a factor of six plus total debt to consolidated EBITDAR.  The leverage ratio shall be less than


Index

or equal to

4.00

to

1.0

as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The Debt Agreements also contain certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.  As of

December 30, 2017

, the Company was in compliance with

all

debt covenants.

The Debt Agreements contain customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments, certain ERISA events and invalidity of loan documents. Upon certain changes of control, payment under the Debt Agreements could become due and payable. In addition, under the Note Purchase Agreement, upon an event of default or change of control, the make whole payment described above may become due and payable.

The Note Purchase Agreement also requires that, in the event the Company amends its 2016 Senior Credit Facility, or any subsequent credit facility of

$100 million

or greater, such that it contains covenant or default provisions that are not provided in the Note Purchase Agreement or that are similar to those contained in the Note Purchase Agreement but which contain percentages, amounts, formulas or grace periods that are more restrictive than those set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement or are otherwise more beneficial to the lenders thereunder, the Note Purchase Agreement shall be automatically amended to include such additional or amended covenants and/or default provisions.

Interest Rate Swaps

The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement which became effective on

March 31, 2016

, with a maturity date of

February 19, 2021

.  The notional amount of this swap agreement began at

$197.5 million

(the principal amount of the February 2016 Term Loan borrowings as of March 31, 2016) and will amortize at the same time and in the same amount as the February 2016 Term Loan borrowings as described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, up to the maturity date of the interest rate swap agreement on February 19, 2021.  As of

December 30, 2017

, the notional amount of the interest rate swap was

$180.0 million

.

The Company entered into a second interest rate swap agreement which became effective on

June 30, 2017

, with a maturity date of

June 15, 2022

.  The notional amount of this swap agreement began at

$100 million

(the principal amount of the June 2017 Term Loan borrowings as of June 30, 2017) and will amortize at the same time and in the same amount as the June 2017 Term Loan borrowings as described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  As of

December 30, 2017

, the notional amount of the interest rate swap was

$97.5 million

.

The Company’s interest rate swap agreements are executed for risk management and are not held for trading purposes. The objective of the interest rate swap agreements is to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates. To accomplish this objective, the interest rate swap agreements are intended to hedge the variable cash flows associated with the variable rate term loan borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.  Both interest rate swap agreements entitle the Company to receive, at specified intervals, a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR in exchange for the payment of a fixed rate of interest throughout the life of the agreement, without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our debt facilities.  Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and selective acquisitions, while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders.

The following table presents a summary of cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):

(a)

As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 (discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.

Operating Activities

Operating activities provided net cash of

$631.5 million

,

$650.7 million

and

$456.2 million

in fiscal


,


and


, respectively.  The

$19.2 million

decrease

in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal


compared to fiscal


was due to changes in the following (in millions):

(a)

As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 (discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of fiscal 2016 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.

The

$19.2 million

decrease

in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal


compared with fiscal


primarily reflects the timing of receipts and payments in relation to inventory and accounts payable partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization due to new store growth and investments in information technology and infrastructure.

The

$194.5 million

increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal


over fiscal


was due to changes in the following (in millions):

(a)

As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 (discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.

The

$194.5 million

increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal


compared with fiscal


primarily reflects incremental profitability and the impact of effective management of inventory and accounts payable levels.  Average inventory per store decreased year-over-year principally due to an improvement in inventory turns of seasonal and cold-weather merchandise at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.  Additionally, the timing of payments to vendors more closely aligned with receipt of inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 in comparison with the end of fiscal 2015, resulting in an improvement in cash flow year-over-year.

Investing Activities

Investing activities used cash of

$238.0 million

,

$369.3 million

and

$235.9 million

in fiscal


,


and


, respectively.   Fiscal 2016 had a significant cash outflow from investing activities related to the acquisition of Petsense.  Other than cash flows related to the acquisition of Petsense, cash flows from investing activities in the years presented are primarily composed of capital expenditures.  Capital expenditures for fiscal


,


and


were as follows (in millions):

The above table reflects an investment in


new Tractor Supply stores and

three

store relocations, as well as


new Petsense stores during fiscal


.  In 2016, we opened


new Tractor Supply stores, had

three

store relocations and began operating 143 Petsense stores as compared to


new Tractor Supply stores and

six

store relocations in fiscal


.  Existing store expenditures were higher in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2015, due to the investment in the chain-wide LED lighting retrofit initiative, which was completed in fiscal 2017.

The sustained increase in spending on information technology represents continued support of our store growth and our omni-channel platform, as well as improvements in security and compliance, enhancements to our customer relationship management database and other strategic initiatives.

Spending for distribution center capacity and improvements increased in fiscal 2017 as we began construction of a new northeast distribution center in Frankfort, New York, and expansion of our distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska.  Distribution center spending was also higher in fiscal 2015 as a result of the construction of two mixing centers in Texas and the southwest distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona, all of which began operations in fiscal 2015.

We currently estimate that capital expenditures in fiscal


will range between $260 million and $300 million.

•

We plan to open approximately


Tractor Supply stores and 20 Petsense stores in fiscal


.

•

We plan to continue to invest in the development of our new northeast distribution center.  We also plan to invest in two additional mixing centers and an East Coast import center.

•

Additionally, we will continue to enhance our digital and omni-channel capabilities to better serve our customers.

Financing Activities

Financing activities used cash of

$338.3 million

,

$291.3 million

and

$207.6 million

in fiscal


,


and


, respectively.

The

$47.0 million

increase

in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal

As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 (discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of fiscal 2016 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.


Index

The increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal


compared to fiscal


is largely due to incremental share repurchases of common stock and a reduction in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, under our debt facilities.

The

$83.7 million

increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal


compared to fiscal


was due to changes in the following (in millions):

(a)

As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 (discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), excess tax benefits on stock options exercised are no longer presented as a separate line item in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation.

The increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal


as compared to fiscal


is due to incremental share repurchases of common stock, fewer borrowings, net of repayments, under our debt facilities, and an increase in quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders.

Repurchase of Common Stock

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program of up to

$3 billion

, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through

December 31, 2020

. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability and other market conditions. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.

We repurchased approximately

5.9 million

,

4.4 million

and

3.4 million

shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of

$369.4 million

,

$331.7 million

and

$292.7 million

in fiscal


,


and


, respectively.  As of

December 30, 2017

, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of

$0.9 billion

, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.

Cash Dividends Paid to Stockholders

We paid cash dividends totaling

$133.8 million

,

$122.3 million

and

$103.1 million

in fiscal


,


and


, respectively.  In fiscal


, we declared and paid cash dividends to stockholders of

$1.05

per common share outstanding as compared to

$0.92

and

$0.76

per common share outstanding in fiscal


and fiscal


, respectively.  These payments reflect an increase in the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of fiscal


to $0.27 per share from $0.24 per share and an increase in the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of fiscal


to $0.24 per share from $0.20 per share.

It is the present intention of the Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition and capital needs of the Company, as well as other factors which the Board of Directors deem relevant.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate changes, primarily as a result of borrowings under our 2016 Senior Credit Facility (as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which bear interest based on variable rates.

As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into interest rate swap agreements which are intended to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates for the term loan borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility. As a result of the interest rate swaps, our exposure to interest rate volatility is minimized. The interest rate swap agreements have been executed for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes.

A 1% change in interest rates on our variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps would have affected interest expense by approximately $2.1 million, $1.5 million, and $1.1 million in the fiscal years ended

December 30, 2017

,

December 31, 2016

, and

December 26, 2015

, respectively.  As of December 30, 2017, we have no outstanding variable rate debt other than the borrowings which are covered by interest rate swaps; therefore, on a prospective basis, a 1% change in interest rates on our variable rate debt, in excess of that amount covered by the interest rate swaps, would result in no additional interest expense.

Purchase Price Volatility

Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.  We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.  Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.  Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility, principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).  The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 30, 2017

.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).  Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of

December 30, 2017

, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, has issued a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies:

Nature of Business

Founded in 1938, Tractor Supply Company (the “Company” or “we”) is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States (“U.S.”).  The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the “

Out Here

” lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  Stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.  At

December 30, 2017

, the Company operated a total of

1,853

retail stores in


states (

1,685

Tractor Supply and Del’s retail stores and


Petsense retail stores) and also offered a number of products online at

TractorSupply.com

and

Petsense.com

.

Basis of Presentation

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company adopted accounting guidance which affected the presentation in the statement of cash flows of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the exercise of stock options as discussed in Note 15.  The Company has elected to apply the amendments using a retrospective transition method for all periods presented and therefore the presentation of previously reported excess tax benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows has been changed to conform to the presentation used in the current period.  As a result,

$11.7 million

and

$27.0 million

of excess tax benefits related to share-based awards which were previously classified as cash flows from financing activities have been reclassified as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended

December 31, 2016

, and

December 26, 2015

, respectively.  Additionally, beginning in fiscal 2017, the Statement of Stockholders’ Equity is no longer impacted by the excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the exercise of stock options.

Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.  The fiscal year ended

December 30, 2017

consisted of 52 weeks, the fiscal year ended

December 31, 2016

consisted of 53 weeks and the fiscal year ended

December 26, 2015

consisted of 52 weeks.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Management Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) inherently requires estimates and assumptions by management of the Company that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas:

Inventory Valuation

Inventory Impairment Risk

The Company identifies potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.  The Company has established an inventory valuation reserve to recognize the estimated impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) based on the Company’s aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. The Company does not believe its merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.  However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.


Index

Shrinkage

The Company performs physical inventories at least once a year for each store that has been open more than 12 months, and the Company has established a reserve for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.  The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods’ sales volumes.  Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.   The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.  The Company believes historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.

Vendor Funding

The Company receives funding from substantially all of its significant merchandise vendors, in support of its business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds (“vendor support”) and volume-based rebate funds (“volume rebates”).  The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are “evergreen,” reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors.  Certain of the Company’s agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor’s product.  Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory, and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.

During interim periods, the amount of vendor support and volume rebates are estimated based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.

The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding) is based on the Company’s current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.  Although the Company believes it can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could be different from previously estimated amounts.

Freight

The Company incurs various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.  Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.

Self-Insurance Reserves

The Company self-insures a significant portion of its employee medical insurance, workers’ compensation insurance and general liability (including product liability) insurance plans.  The Company has stop-loss insurance policies to protect it from individual losses over specified dollar values.  For self-insured employee medical claims, we have a stop loss limit of

$300,000

per person per year.  Our deductible or self-insured retention, as applicable, for each claim involving workers’ compensation insurance and general liability insurance is limited to

$500,000

and our Texas Work Injury Policy is limited to

$750,000

.  Further, we maintain a commercially reasonable umbrella/excess policy that covers liabilities in excess of the primary insurance policy limits.

The full extent of certain claims, especially workers’ compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years.  Therefore, the Company estimates potential obligations based upon historical claims experience, industry factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.  Although the Company believes the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant change in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material effect on the Company’s financial results.  At

December 30, 2017

, the Company had recorded net insurance reserves of

$57.9 million

compared to

$54.3 million

at

December 31, 2016

.

Sales Tax Audit Reserve

A portion of the Company’s sales are to tax-exempt customers,

predominantly agricultural-based

.  The Company obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.  Many of the states in which the Company conducts business will perform audits to verify the Company’s compliance with applicable sales tax laws.  The business activities of the Company’s customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by the Company create a challenging and complex tax compliance environment.  These circumstances also create some risk that the Company could be challenged as to the accuracy of the Company’s sales tax compliance.

The Company reviews past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if it has potential exposure for non-compliance.  Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and historical experience with each state.  The Company continually reassesses the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.  The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the

complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.

Tax Contingencies

The Company’s income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.  These audits include questions regarding tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities.  In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company’s various tax filing positions, the Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified.  The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.  Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.  Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.  The Company adjusts its tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from the established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

The Company’s tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with the Company’s various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.

The effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, the Company first compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated undiscounted future cash flows.  The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.  The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.  If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company calculates an impairment loss.  The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. The Company recognizes an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value. If the Company recognizes an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset.

Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

In accordance with the accounting standards, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value.

The quantitative impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company’s operations, for the amount, if any, in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.  We determine fair values for each reporting unit using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.


Index

The quantitative impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the implied fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company’s operations.

Revenue Recognition and Sales Returns

The Company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.  If the Company receives payment before completion of its customer obligations (as per the Company’s special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the customer takes possession of the merchandise and the sale is complete.

The Company is required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental agency on a periodic basis.  These taxes and fees are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.  The Company records a liability upon collection from the customer and relieves the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.

The Company estimates a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and the Company believes that its estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.  However, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.  At

December 30, 2017

, the Company had a liability of

$3.8 million

reserved for sales returns compared to

$4.2 million

at

December 31, 2016

.

The Company recognizes revenue when a gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognizes income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as “breakage”).  The gift cards and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift cards and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.  The Company recognized breakage income of

$2.4 million

,

$1.9 million

and

$1.6 million

in fiscal


,


and


, respectively.

Cost of Merchandise Sold

Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from vendors to distribution facilities, from distribution facilities to retail stores, from one distribution facility to another, and directly to our customers; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage (physical inventory losses), lower of cost or net realizable value, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution facility and corporate employees; share-based compensation expenses; occupancy costs of retail, distribution and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars and customer-targeted direct mail, as well as limited television, radio, digital and social media offerings and other promotions.  Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.  Advertising expenses for fiscal

Warehousing and Distribution Facility Costs

Costs incurred at the Company’s distribution facilities for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SG&A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Company’s gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.  Distribution facility costs including depreciation for fiscal

Pre-opening Costs

Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new stores, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.  Pre-opening costs were approximately

Share-Based Compensation

The Company has share-based compensation plans covering certain members of management and non-employee directors, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units.  In addition, the Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to most employees that work at least


hours per week.

The Company estimates the fair value of its stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a

Black-Scholes

option pricing model. The

Black-Scholes

option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. However, key assumptions used in the

Black-Scholes

model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the Company’s stock option awards. Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life.  The Company relies on historical volatility trends to estimate future volatility assumptions.  The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. The expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the Company’s historical experience for similar options.

In addition to the key assumptions used in the

Black-Scholes

model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period. The Company adjusts this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.

The fair value of the Company’s restricted stock unit awards is the closing price of the Company’s common stock the day preceding the grant date, discounted for the expected dividend yield over the term of the award.

The Company believes its estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.  Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution facility and corporate assets.  Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are anticipated to be in effect when temporary differences reverse or are settled.  The effect of a tax rate change is recognized in the period in which the law is enacted in the provision for income taxes.  The Company records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  Dilutive shares are computed using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.  The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit cards are classified as cash and cash equivalents, as they generally settle within


-


hours.


Index

Sales generated through the Company’s private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.  Under an agreement with Citi Cards, a division of Citigroup, consumer and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup.  All credit program and related services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup.  Payments due from Citigroup are classified as cash and cash equivalents as they generally settle within


-


hours.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables, trade payables, debt instruments and interest rate swaps. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value at each balance sheet date.  The Company had

$427.5 million

in borrowings under our debt facilities (as discussed in Note 5) at

December 30, 2017

, and

$275.0 million

in borrowings as of

December 31, 2016

.  Based on current market interest rates (Level 2 inputs), the carrying value of our borrowings under our debt facilities approximates fair value for each period reported.  The fair value of the Company’s interest rate swaps is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using forward rate curves (a Level 2 input). As described in further detail in Note 6, the fair value of the interest rate swaps, excluding accrued interest, was a

$5.2 million

asset at

December 30, 2017

, and was a

$2.8 million

asset at

December 31, 2016

.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with applicable accounting standards for such instruments and hedging activities, which require that all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.

Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge a certain portion of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply the hedge accounting standards.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or net realizable value.  Inventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight.  Inventories are net of shrinkage, obsolescence, other valuations and vendor allowances.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are carried at cost.  Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.  The following estimated useful lives are generally applied:


Index

The Company entered into agreements with various governmental entities in the states of Kentucky, Georgia and Tennessee to implement tax abatement plans related to its distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky (Simpson County), its distribution center in Macon, Georgia (Bibb County), and its Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee (Williamson County).  The tax abatement plans provide for reduction of real property taxes for specified time frames by legally transferring title to its real property in exchange for industrial revenue bonds.  This property was then leased back to the Company.  No cash was exchanged.

The lease payments are equal to the amount of the payments on the bonds.  The tax abatement period extends through the term of the lease, which coincides with the maturity date of the bonds.  At any time, the Company has the option to purchase the real property by paying off the bonds, plus

$1

.  The terms and amounts authorized and drawn under each industrial revenue bond agreement are outlined as follows, as of

December 30, 2017

:

Due to the form of these transactions, the Company has not recorded the bonds or the lease obligation associated with the sale lease-back transaction. The original cost of the Company’s property and equipment is recorded on the balance sheet and is being depreciated over its estimated useful life.

Capitalized Software Costs

The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years.  Computer software consists of software developed for internal use and third-party software purchased for internal use.  A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the software’s functionality or extends its useful life.  These costs are included in computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.

Store Closing Costs

The Company regularly evaluates the performance of its stores and periodically closes those that are under-performing.  The Company records a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.  Store closing costs were not significant to the results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented.

Leases

Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the Company’s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Certain operating leases include rent increases during the lease term.  For these leases, the Company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement) and records the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability.

The Company occasionally receives reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.  Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs, including items reimbursed by landlords.  Related reimbursements are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the applicable lease term.

Note 2 - Share-Based Compensation:

Share-based compensation includes stock option and restricted stock unit awards and certain transactions under the Company’s ESPP.  Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value of all stock option and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.  The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the purchase date market value and the employee’s purchase price.


Index

There were no significant modifications to the Company’s share-based compensation plans during fiscal


.  At

December 30, 2017

2.3 million

shares available for future equity awards under the Company’s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.

Stock Options

Under the Company’s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to current or prospective officers or employees, non-employee directors and consultants.  The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.  Vesting of options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.

The fair value is separately estimated for each option grant.  The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.  The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a

Black-Scholes

pricing valuation model.  The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.  The ranges of key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal


,


and


, as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:

Expected Price Volatility

— This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate.  The Company applies a historical volatility rate. To calculate historical changes in market value, the Company uses daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.  The Company believes the use of historical price volatility provides an appropriate indicator of future volatility.  An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.

Risk-Free Interest Rate

— This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.

Weighted Average Expected Lives

— This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience. Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years.  An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.

Forfeiture Rate

— This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested.  This estimate is based on historical experience. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.

Dividend Yield

—This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted.  An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.


Index

The Company issues shares for options when exercised. A summary of stock option activity is as follows:

The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total difference between the Company’s closing stock price at each year-end and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options at each year-end.  As of

Note 3 - Acquisition of Petsense:

On

September 29, 2016

, the Company completed the acquisition of Petsense.  Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, Petsense is a small-box pet specialty supply retailer focused on meeting the needs of pet owners, primarily in small and mid-size communities, and offering a variety of pet products and services.  Pursuant to the agreement governing the transaction, the Company acquired all the outstanding equity interests in Petsense for an all-cash purchase price which was financed with cash on-hand and revolver borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility (as defined in Note 5).

The total consideration transferred in connection with the Petsense acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values.  The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is estimated based on either one or a combination of the following methodologies: the income approach, the cost approach or the market approach as determined based on the nature of the asset or liability and the level of inputs available.  With respect to assets and liabilities, the determination of fair value requires management to make subjective judgments as to projections of future operating performance, the appropriate discount rate to apply, long-term growth rates, etc. (i.e. unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy), which affect the amounts recorded in the purchase price allocation. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets, net of liabilities, is recorded as goodwill, which is indicative of the expected continued growth and development of the pet specialty retail business acquired.

The table below summarizes the consideration transferred and allocation of the purchase price for the Petsense acquisition (in thousands):

In September 2017, the Company finalized the working capital settlement pursuant to the agreement governing the transaction.  As a result, the values of the consideration transferred, assets acquired and liabilities assumed as reflected in the table above are considered final.  The working capital settlement reduced both the consideration transferred and goodwill by

$1.2 million

from the preliminary values.

The resulting goodwill of $

82.9 million

and tradename of $

31.3 million

are amortized for income tax purposes.

The results of operations of Petsense have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of acquisition.

Note 4 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets:

Goodwill

The Company had approximately $

93.2 million

and

$94.4 million

of goodwill at

December 30, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

, respectively.  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended

December 30, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

are as follows (in thousands):

Goodwill is allocated to each identified reporting unit, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment.

Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company completes its impairment evaluation by performing valuation analyses and considering other publicly available market information, as appropriate.

The test used to identify the potential for goodwill impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.  An impairment charge would be recorded to the Company’s operations for the amount, if any, in which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal


, the Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and

no

impairment was identified. The Company determined that the fair value of each reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the respective reporting unit.  In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of each reporting unit was determined based on either a market or an income approach.  Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market data.

Other Intangible Assets

The Company had approximately $

31.3 million

of intangible assets other than goodwill at

December 30, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

.  The intangible asset balance represents the estimated fair value of the Petsense tradename, which is not subject to amortization as it has an indefinite useful life on the basis that it is expected to contribute cash flows beyond the foreseeable horizon.

With respect to intangible assets, we evaluate for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  We recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount is not recoverable through its discounted cash flows and measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value. In the fourth quarter of fiscal


, the Company completed its annual impairment testing of intangible assets and

no

impairment was identified.

Note 5 - Debt:

The following table summarizes the Company’s outstanding debt as of the dates indicated (in millions):

Senior Notes

On August 14, 2017, the Company entered into a note purchase and private shelf agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell

$150 million

aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due

August 14, 2029

(the “2029 Notes”) in a private placement.  The 2029 Notes bear interest at

3.70%

per annum with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on each annual and semi-annual anniversary of the issuance date.  The obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement are unsecured, but guaranteed by each of the Company’s material subsidiaries.

The Company may from time to time issue and sell additional senior unsecured notes (the “Shelf Notes”) pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount of up to

$150 million

. The Shelf Notes will have a maturity date of no more than


years after the date of original issuance and may be issued through

August 14, 2020

, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement.

Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the 2029 Notes and any Shelf Notes (collectively, the "Notes") are redeemable by the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at

100%

of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon and a make whole amount calculated by discounting all remaining scheduled payments on the Notes by the yield on the U.S. Treasury security with a maturity equal to the remaining average life of the Notes plus

0.50%

Proceeds from the 2016 Senior Credit Facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and other matters.  There are

no

compensating balance requirements associated with the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.

Covenants and Default Provisions of the Debt Agreements

The 2016 Senior Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement (collectively, the “Debt Agreements”) require quarterly compliance with respect to

two

material covenants:  a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.  Both ratios are calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis at the end of each fiscal quarter.  The fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and rent expense (“consolidated EBITDAR”) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments).  The fixed charge coverage ratio shall be greater than or equal to

2.00

to

1.0

as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  The leverage ratio compares rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments) multiplied by a factor of six plus total debt to consolidated EBITDAR.  The leverage ratio shall be less than or equal to

4.00

to

1.0

as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  The Debt Agreements also contain certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.  As of

December 30, 2017

, the Company was in compliance with

all

debt covenants.

The Debt Agreements contain customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments, certain ERISA events and invalidity of loan documents.  Upon certain changes of control, payment under the Debt Agreements could become due and payable.  In addition, under the Note Purchase Agreement, upon an event of default or change of control, the make whole payment described above may become due and payable.

The Note Purchase Agreement also requires that, in the event the Company amends its 2016 Senior Credit Facility, or any subsequent credit facility of

$100 million

or greater, such that it contains covenant or default provisions that are not provided in the Note Purchase Agreement or that are similar to those contained in the Note Purchase Agreement but which contain percentages, amounts, formulas or grace periods that are more restrictive than those set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement or are otherwise more beneficial to the lenders thereunder, the Note Purchase Agreement shall be automatically amended to include such additional or amended covenants and/or default provisions.

Note 6 - Interest Rate Swaps:

The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement which became effective on

March 31, 2016

, with a maturity date of

February 19, 2021

.  The notional amount of this swap agreement began at

$197.5 million

(the principal amount of the February 2016 Term Loan borrowings as of March 31, 2016) and will amortize at the same time and in the same amount as the February 2016 Term Loan borrowings as described in Note 5, up to the maturity date of the interest rate swap agreement on February 19, 2021.  As of

December 30, 2017

, the notional amount of the interest rate swap was

$180.0 million

.

The Company entered into a second interest rate swap agreement which became effective on

June 30, 2017

, with a maturity date of

June 15, 2022

.  The notional amount of this swap agreement began at

$100 million

(the principal amount of the June 2017 Term Loan borrowings as of June 30, 2017) and will amortize at the same time and in the same amount as the June 2017 Term Loan borrowings as described in Note 5.  As of

December 30, 2017

, the notional amount of the interest rate swap was

$97.5 million

.

The Company’s interest rate swap agreements are executed for risk management and are not held for trading purposes. The objective of the interest rate swap agreements is to mitigate interest rate risk associated with future changes in interest rates. To accomplish this objective, the interest rate swap agreements are intended to hedge the variable cash flows associated with the variable rate term loan borrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.  Both interest rate swap agreements entitle the Company to receive,


Index

at specified intervals, a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR in exchange for the payment of a fixed rate of interest throughout the life of the agreement, without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

The Company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges and accounts for the underlying activity in accordance with hedge accounting.  The interest rate swaps are presented within the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. In accordance with hedge accounting, the effective portion of gains and losses on interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (“OCI” or “OCL”, respectively) and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.  The ineffective portion of gains and losses on interest rate swaps, if any, are recognized in current earnings.

The assets and liabilities measured at fair value related to the Company’s interest rate swaps, excluding accrued interest, were as follows (in thousands):

The offset to the interest rate swap asset or liability is recorded as a component of equity, net of deferred taxes, in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (“AOCI” or “AOCL,” respectively), and will be reclassified into earnings over the term of the underlying debt as interest payments are made.

The following table summarizes the changes in AOCI/AOCL, net of tax, related to the Company’s interest rate swaps (in thousands):

As of

December 30, 2017

, the estimated pre-tax portion of AOCI that is expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months is

$0.9 million

. Cash flows related to the interest rate swaps are included in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Credit-risk-related contingent features

In accordance with the underlying interest rate swap agreements, the Company could be declared in default on its interest rate swap obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness (i.e., the Company’s term loan) is accelerated by the lender due to the Company's default on such indebtedness.

If the Company had breached any of the provisions in the underlying agreements at

December 30, 2017

, it could have been required to post full collateral or settle its obligations under the Company’s interest rate swap agreements.  However, as of

December 30, 2017

, the Company had not breached any of these provisions or posted any collateral related to the underlying interest rate swap agreements.  Further, as of

December 30, 2017

, the net balance of each of the Company’s interest rate swaps were in a net asset position and therefore the Company would have

no

obligation upon default.

Note 7 - Leases:

The Company leases the majority of its retail store locations, two distribution sites, its Merchandise Innovation Center, transportation equipment and other equipment under various non-cancellable operating leases.  The leases have varying terms and expire at various dates through

years, with

two

to

four

optional renewal periods of

five

years each.  Some leases require the payment of contingent rent that is based upon store sales above agreed-upon sales levels for the year.  The sales levels vary for each store and are established in the lease agreements.  Generally, most of the leases also require that the Company pays associated taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.

Note 9 - Treasury Stock:

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program of up to

$3 billion

, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through

December 31, 2020

. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability and other market conditions. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.

The Company repurchased approximately

5.9 million

Note 11 – Income Taxes:

The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):


Index

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Under the provisions of the Act, the U.S. corporate income tax rate decreased from

35%

to

21%

effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. This change required the Company to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which generally is

21%

for federal income tax purposes.  We have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances as of December 30, 2017, and recognized a provisional expense amount of

$4.9 million

, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances.  We will recognize any changes to this provisional amount as we refine our estimates of our cumulative temporary differences as well as interpretations of the application of the Act.

The Company has evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets.  The Company believes that all of the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized through future earnings.  The Company had state tax credit carryforwards of

$5.1 million

and

$7.5 million

as of

December 30, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

, respectively, with varying dates of expiration between 2017 and 2030.  The Company provided

no

valuation allowance as of

December 30, 2017

and

December 31, 2016

for state tax credit carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that all of these credits will be utilized before their expiration dates.


Index

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amounts computed at the federal statutory rate is as follows (in thousands):

The Company and its affiliates file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and local jurisdictions.  With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012.  Various states have completed an examination of our income tax returns for 2011 through 2014 with minimal adjustments.

The total amount of unrecognized tax positions that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate, is

$1.7 million

at

December 30, 2017

. In addition, the Company recognizes current interest and penalties accrued related to these uncertain tax positions as interest expense, and the amount is not material to the Consolidated Statements of Income.  The Company has considered the reasonably possible expected net change in uncertain tax positions during the next 12 months and does not expect any material changes to our liability for uncertain tax positions through December 29, 2018.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits (exclusive of interest and penalties) is as follows (in thousands):

Note 12 - Retirement Benefit Plans:

The Company has a defined contribution benefit plan, the Tractor Supply Company 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), which provides retirement benefits for eligible employees.  The Company matches (in cash)

100%

of the employee’s elective contributions up to

3%

of eligible compensation plus

50%

of the employee’s elective contributions from

3%

to

6%

of eligible compensation.  In no event shall the total Company match made on behalf of the employee exceed

4.5%

of the employee’s eligible compensation.  All current contributions are immediately vested.  Company contributions to the 401(k) Plan during fiscal


,


and


, were approximately

$7.4 million

,

$6.6 million

and

$5.9 million

, respectively.

The Company offers, through a deferred compensation program, the opportunity for certain qualifying employees to elect to defer a portion of their annual base salary and/or their annual incentive bonus.  Under the deferred compensation program, a percentage of the participants’ salary deferral is matched by the Company, limited to a maximum annual matching contribution of

$4,500

.  The Company’s contributions, including accrued interest, during fiscal

Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies:

Construction and Real Estate Commitments

At

December 30, 2017

, the Company had contractual commitments of approximately $


million related to the ongoing construction of its new distribution center in Frankfort, New York, and the expansion of its existing distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska.  There were

Litigation

Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental legal proceedings if the proceeding reasonably involves potential monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. We periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies, which are addressed on a case-by-case basis with the relevant agency. The Company received a subpoena from the District Attorney of Yolo County, California, requesting records and information regarding its hazardous waste management and disposal practices in California.  The Company and the Office of the District Attorney of Yolo County engaged in settlement discussions which resulted in the settlement of the matter.  A consent decree reflecting the terms of settlement was filed with the Yolo County Superior Court on June 23, 2017.  Under the settlement, the Company agreed to a compliance plan and also agreed to pay a civil penalty and fund supplemental environmental projects furthering consumer protection and environmental enforcement in California.  The civil penalty did not differ materially from the amount accrued.  The cost of the settlement and the compliance with the consent decree will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company is also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided for in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.  Accordingly, the Company currently expects these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 15 – New Accounting Pronouncements:

New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted

In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.”  This update requires an entity that determines the cost of inventory by methods other than last-in, first-out and the retail inventory method to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 using a prospective application.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04, “Liabilities - Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products.”  This update requires that liabilities related to the sale of prepaid stored-value products (gift cards) be adjusted periodically to reflect breakage.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  The Company was recording gift card breakage prior to the adoption of this guidance; therefore, the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.”  The update addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation transactions including: (a) income tax consequences when awards vest or are settled, (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, (c) a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis and (d) classification


Index

of excess tax impacts on the statement of cash flows.  The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax expense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from share-based compensation awards is dependent on our stock price at the date the awards are exercised or settled.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which did not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.  The Company has elected to continue estimating forfeitures of share-based awards.  The Company has elected to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using a retrospective transition method, and as a result, excess tax benefits related to share-based awards which had been previously classified as cash flows from financing activities will be reclassified as cash flows from operating activities.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.”  This update clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by U.S. GAAP and thereby reduces the current and potential future diversity in practice.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  The adoption of this guidance did not impact the classification of any of the Company’s cash flow activity and therefore did not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.”  This update simplifies the measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the goodwill impairment test, which requires the comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.  Instead, under the amendments in this guidance, an entity shall perform a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount and an impairment charge is to be recorded for the amount, if any, in which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 using a prospective application.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).”  ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards.  The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards.  The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers.  Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,” which implemented a one-year deferral of ASU 2014-09.  As a result of the deferral, the amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),” which further clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,” which further clarifies the aspects of (a) identifying performance obligations and (b) the licensing implementation guidance.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):  Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,” which provides implementation guidance in regards to (a) assessing the collectability criterion, (b) the presentation of taxes collected from customers, (c) noncash consideration, (d) contract modification at transition, (e) completed contracts at transition and (f) other technical corrections.  In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which is intended to clarify the codification and to correct unintended application of guidance pertaining to Topic 606 and other Topics amended by ASU 2014-09 to increase stakeholders’ awareness of the proposals and to expedite improvements to ASU 2014-09.  The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-20 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09.  Entities that transition to these standards may either retrospectively restate each prior reporting period or reflect the cumulative effect of initially applying the updates with an adjustment to retained earnings at the date of adoption.  The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method.  Based on an evaluation of the standard as a whole, the Company has identified customer incentives and principal versus agent considerations as the areas that will most likely be affected by the new revenue recognition guidance.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).”   This update requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee will account for leases as finance leases or operating leases.  Both finance leases and operating leases will


Index

result in the lessee recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on its balance sheet, with differing methodology for income statement recognition.  This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  A modified retrospective approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements.  The Company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting.”  This update provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718.  An entity should account for the effects of a modification unless (a) the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the original award is modified, (b) the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified or (c) the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 are effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period, for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not been issued. The amendments in ASU 2017-09 should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date.  The Company plans to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities,” which amends and simplifies existing guidance in order to allow companies to more accurately present the economic effects of risk management activities in the financial statements.  This update expands and refines hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements.  Additionally, the amendments in ASU 2017-12 provide new guidance about income statement classification and eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness.  This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The amendments in ASU 2017-12 require that an entity with cash flow or net investment hedges existing at the date of adoption apply a cumulative-effect adjustment to eliminate the separate measurement of ineffectiveness to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year that the entity adopts this guidance.  The amended presentation and disclosure guidance is adopted prospectively.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,” which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  This guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The amendments in ASU 2018-02 should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.
