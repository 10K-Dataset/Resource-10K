FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OR INFORMATION

This Form 10-K includes certain statements that may be deemed to be
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements included or incorporated by
reference in this Form 10-K which address activities, events or developments
that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future,
including such things as future capital expenditures (including their amount
and nature), business strategy, expansion and growth of the Company’s business
operations and other such matters are forward-looking statements.

All phases of the Company’s operations are subject to influences outside its
control. Any one, or a combination, of these factors could materially affect
the results of the Company’s operations. These factors include general economic
cycles affecting consumer spending, weather factors, operating factors
affecting customer satisfaction, consumer debt levels, pricing and other
competitive factors, the ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified
employees, the ability to identify suitable locations and negotiate favorable
lease agreements on new and relocated stores, the timing and acceptance of new
products in the stores, the mix of goods sold, the continued availability of
favorable credit sources, capital market conditions in general, threats of war
or terrorism, and the seasonality of the Company’s business. Many of these
factors have previously been identified in filings or statements made by or on
behalf of the Company. Forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the
Company are based on a knowledge of its business and the environment in which
it operates, but because of the factors listed above, actual results could
differ materially from those reflected by any forward-looking statements.
Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements made are qualified by these
cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or
developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if
substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequences to or
effects on the Company or its business and operations.

PART I

Item 1. Business

Overview

Tractor Supply Company, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), was founded in
1938 as a catalog mail order tractor parts supplier. In 1982, the Company was
purchased by a group of investors, including a member of the Company’s current
management team who is a significant stockholder. In 1994, the Company made
its initial public offering. Today, the Company is the largest operator of
retail farm and ranch stores in the United States. The Company is focused on
supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and serving
the maintenance needs of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as
tradesmen and small businesses. Stores are located in towns outlying major
metropolitan markets and in rural communities. The Company offers the following
comprehensive selection of merchandise: (1) livestock and pet products,
including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment; (2)
maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; (3) hardware and tool
products; (4) seasonal products, including lawn and garden power equipment; (5)
truck, trailer and towing products; and (6) work clothing for the entire
family. The Company’s stores typically range in size from 12,500 to 15,500
square feet of inside selling space and utilize approximately as many square
feet of outside selling space. The Company operated 433 retail farm stores in
30 states as of December 28, 2002.

Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment — the operation of
farm and ranch retail stores.

Seasonality and Weather

The Company’s business is highly seasonal. Historically, the Company’s sales
and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of
each year due to the sale of seasonal products. The Company typically operates
at a net loss in the first fiscal quarter of each year. Unseasonable weather,
excessive rain, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect the Company’s
sales. The Company believes, however, that the impact of adverse weather
conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its stores.

The Company experiences a buildup of inventory and accounts payable during its
first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in
anticipation of the April through June selling season and again during its
third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the October through December selling
season.

Business Strategy

The Company believes its sales and earnings growth has resulted from the
focused execution of its business strategy, which includes the following key
components:

Page 3 of 23


changed for seasonal products and promotions. Display and product
placement information is sent to stores monthly to ensure quality
and uniformity among the stores. Informative signs are located
throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing
decisions and merchandise location. The uniformity of the store
layouts and visual displays affords the customer a feeling of
familiarity and enhances the shopping experience. To further
enhance the shopping experience, all store employees wear highly
visible red smocks and nametags and customer service desks and
check out counters are conveniently located.

Merchandising

The Company seeks to offer an extensive, consistent merchandise
mix, tailored to some extent to specific regional needs and store
size. The Company’s full line of product offerings is supported by
a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of 12,500 to
14,500 products per store. Stores carry a wide selection of high
quality, nationally recognized, name brand merchandise. The
Company has established close working relationships with many of
its principal vendors to manage stock levels, develop new
products, plan promotions and design merchandise displays. The
Company intends to continue to expand its vendor partnering
strategy to include most of its other key vendors. The Company
also markets private-label merchandise under the Tractor Supply
Company brand as well as Huskee, Traveller, Producer’s Pride,
Retriever and Dumor registered trademarks.

The following chart indicates the average percentages of sales
represented by each of the Company’s major product categories
during fiscal 2002 and 2001:

Purchasing and Distribution

The Company offers an extensive selection of farm and ranch
maintenance and other specialty products. The Company’s business
is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of
vendors. The Company purchases its products from approximately
870 vendors, the five largest of which accounted for less than 20%
of total purchases in fiscal 2002 and no one vendor accounted for
more than 10% of purchases during such year. The Company has no
material long-term contractual commitments with any of its
vendors, has not experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory
alternative sources of supply for its products and believes that
adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs
for substantially all of its products. Over 95% of the Company’s
purchase orders are transmitted through an electronic data
interchanges (“EDI”) system, and approximately 64% of vendor
invoices are transmitted through EDI. The Company is working to
expand the number of vendors who transmit invoices to the Company
and increase the amount of sales history transmitted from the
Company, all through EDI. The Company’s supply chain process is
centrally managed.

The Company operates a 500,000 square foot distribution center in
Pendleton, Indiana, a 144,000 square foot distribution center in
Omaha, Nebraska and a 105,000 square foot distribution center in
Waco, Texas. The Company also utilizes a 57,000 square foot,
strategically located “cross-dock” facility in Rural Hall, North
Carolina to support the main distribution centers and
transportation system network in servicing certain stores located
in the Southeast region of the country. In fiscal 2002, the
Company received approximately 65% of its merchandise through
these distribution facilities, with the balance delivered directly
to the Company’s stores. The Company’s transportation fleet is
managed by UPS Supply Chain Solutions (“UPS”), who supports the
Company’s distribution centers and the “cross-dock” facility.
Additionally, UPS

match). Additionally, the Company shares in the cost of health
insurance provided to its employees and employees receive a
discount on merchandise purchased at the Company’s stores.

Management also encourages a “promote from within” environment
when internal resources permit. Two of the five members of the
Company’s senior management, most of the Company’s district
managers and a significant portion of the Company’s store managers
were promoted to their positions from within the Company. All
executive officers have at least 16 years of business experience
and one executive officer has over 21 years of experience with the
Company. District managers and store managers have an average
length of service with the Company of approximately 4.2 years and
3.9 years, respectively. (This tenure reflects the addition of 113
new stores during fiscal 2002.) Management believes internal
promotions coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous
retail experience will provide the management structure necessary
to support expected store growth. Management believes it has
satisfactory relationships with its employees.

Management Information and Control Systems

The Company has invested considerable resources in sophisticated
management information and control systems to ensure superior
customer service, support the purchase and distribution of
merchandise and improve operating efficiencies. The management
information and control systems include a point-of-sale system
(with communications via a frame relay network to the Company’s
primary systems), a supply chain management and replenishment
system, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise
presentation system. These systems are fully integrated and track
merchandise from order through sale. All operational data from
these systems is also fully integrated with the Company’s
financial systems.

The Company continues to evaluate and improve the functionality of
its systems to maximize their effectiveness. Such efforts will
include an ongoing evaluation of the optimal software
configuration (including system enhancements and upgrades) as well
as the adequacy of the underlying hardware components. These
efforts are directed toward constantly improving the overall
business processes and achieving the most efficient and effective
use of the system to manage the Company’s operations.

Growth Strategy

The Company’s current and long-term growth strategy is built on a combination
of (1) expanded geographic market presence, achieved through the opening of new
retail stores at an annual growth rate of 8% to 10% and (2) enhanced financial
performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through aggressive
merchandising programs with an “everyday low prices” philosophy, supported by
strong customer service.

The Company has experienced considerable growth in recent years, including the
addition of 35 stores in fiscal 2000, 18 in fiscal 2001 and 113 in fiscal 2002.
This recent growth has increased the Company’s market presence in the
Southwest, primarily in Texas, the Southeast, primarily in Tennessee, Kentucky,
North Carolina and Florida, in the central northern part of the United States,
primarily in Ohio and Michigan and in the Northeast, primarily in Pennsylvania
and New York. The Company operated 433 stores in 30 states as of December 28,
2002 and has a base plan to open 30 to 35 stores in fiscal 2003. The Company
plans to open 40 to 45 new stores in fiscal 2004 and additional stores
thereafter. The Company believes it has developed a sophisticated proven
method for selecting store sites and has identified over 600 potential
additional markets for new stores in the United States. In addition, the
Company continues to identify opportunities to relocate existing stores to
ensure optimal locations to promote growth.

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company purchased real property for 24
store locations, lease rights for 76 store locations and fixtures from 100
stores from Quality Stores, Inc. (which was in bankruptcy liquidation). During
fiscal 2002, 87 stores were opened as new Tractor Supply stores and nine
Tractor Supply stores were relocated to the acquired locations. The Company has
also decided to open one additional store (previously held for sale) and hold
the remaining locations for sale. With this transaction, the Company has
achieved store growth in fiscal 2002 that is approximately four times the
historical unit store growth plan for a single year. The Company avoided the
potential pitfalls of acquiring redundant headquarters and information systems
and did not acquire any inventory, thus avoiding the challenges of integrating
similar products with dissimilar packaging into its existing stock, as well as

Page 6 of 23


avoiding the challenge of liquidating other products which conflict with the
Company’s existing product offerings. Rather, the Company selected only the
geographic markets that it believed had the greatest potential.

This aggressive expansion occurred in a more compressed timeframe than the
Company’s historical store growth, including the opening of 90 stores in the
second quarter of fiscal 2002. To achieve this level of growth, the Company
devoted substantial resources toward this endeavor and incurred considerable
cost to ensure the stores were opened in accordance with the planned strategy.
The transition of these locations to Tractor Supply Company stores was
completed during the third fiscal quarter of 2002.

The Company’s strategy is generally to lease its new stores. At December 28,
2002, 358 of the Company’s 433 stores are leased. Assuming that new stores are
leased, the estimated cash required to open a new store is approximately
$800,000 to $1,000,000, the majority of which is for initial acquisition of
inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements and
fixtures and equipment) and the balance of which is for pre- opening expenses.

The Company plans to relocate a total of 10 to 12 stores in fiscal 2003 and an
average of three or four additional stores each year over the next several
years. Store relocations are typically undertaken to move small, older stores
to full-size formats in prime retail areas. The cash required to complete a
store relocation typically ranges from $150,000 to $400,000 depending on
whether the Company is responsible for any renovation or remodeling costs.

The Company plans to extensively remodel 10 of its stronger performing stores
in 2003 and each year thereafter over the next several years. The estimated
cash required to complete a major remodeling typically ranges from $100,000 to
$450,000.

As a result of the rapid expansion discussed above, the Company has gained
considerable expertise in the opening and relocating of its stores. The
average store opening timeframe has been reduced from nine weeks in fiscal 1998
to six weeks in fiscal 2003 with additional timesavings anticipated. The
Company has also improved its store set-up process through the utilization of
third parties for key functions such as fixture procurement, architectural
assistance and procurement of key vendor support (brochures, product training
booklets, etc.) and supplies. The use of third parties to support store
openings and relocations allows management to focus on its primary
responsibility of running the business.

Item 2. Properties

At December 28, 2002, the Company operated 433 stores in 30 states. The
Company leases its four distribution facilities and its management
headquarters, and over 75% of its stores. The store leases typically have
initial terms of between 10 and 15 years, with one to three renewal periods of
five years each, exercisable at the Company’s option. None of the store leases
is individually material to the Company’s operations. The leases at its
Pendleton, Indiana; Omaha, Nebraska; Waco, Texas and Rural Hall, North Carolina
distribution facilities expire in 2015, 2004, 2003 and 2004 respectively, and
the lease for its management headquarters expires in 2007. The Company is
constructing a new, larger facility in Waco, Texas, with an expected opening in
August 2003, which will provide more efficient distribution of merchandise to
Company stores. Two of the Company’s stores are leased from affiliated parties.

protection of the environment, has not had, and is not anticipated to have, a
material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position
of the Company.

the consolidated financial statements
of the Company as of December 30, 2000 and for the year then ended.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and

Stockholders of Tractor Supply Company

In our opinion, the statements of income, of changes in stockholders’
equity and of cash flows for the year ended December 30, 2000 present
fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations of Tractor
Supply Company and its cash flows for the year ended December 30, 2000,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion. We have not
audited the financial statements of Tractor Supply Company for any period
subsequent to December 30, 2000.
