PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  We operate retail stores under the names

Tractor Supply Company

and

Del’s Farm Supply

and operate a website under the name

TractorSupply.com

.  Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:

·

Equine, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment;

·

Hardware, truck, towing and tool products;

·

Seasonal products, including lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys;

·

Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; and

·

Work/recreational clothing and footwear.

Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,500 to 18,500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space.  We use a standard 15,500 square foot prototype for most new purpose-built locations.  For new stores located in existing buildings, one of several layout formats is utilized.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del’s Farm Supply, LLC (“Del’s”), operated 26 stores as of December 25, 2010 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Hawaii.  Del’s stores currently range in size from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and covered/sheltered selling space.

Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment – farm and ranch retail sales, both at our retail locations and online.

At December 25, 2010, we operated 1,001 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states.

Seasonality and Weather

Our business is highly seasonal.  Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products.  Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales. We believe, however, that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores.

We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during the first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season.

Business Strategy

We believe our sales and earnings growth is a result of executing our business strategy, which includes the following key components:

Market Niche

We have identified a specialized market niche:  supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the “

Out Here

” lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  By focusing our product mix on these core customers, we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise, home center and other specialty retailers.

Customer Service

We are committed to providing our customers a high level of in-store service through our motivated, well-trained store team members. We believe the ability of our store team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps to promote strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping. As such, we seek to provide our store team members with decision-making authority, product knowledge and training to enable them to meet our customers’ needs.

We endeavor to staff our stores with courteous, highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members, often in cooperation with our vendors. Our training programs include (i) a full management training program which covers all aspects of our operations, (ii) product knowledge modules produced in conjunction with key vendors, (iii) frequent management skills training classes, (iv) semi-annual store manager meetings with vendor product presentations, (v) vendor sponsored in-store training programs and (vi) ongoing product information updates from our management headquarters, the Store Support Center.  We seek to hire and train store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds, with particular emphasis on general maintenance, equine and welding.

Our online shopping site is

TractorSupply.com

.  The availability of certain of our products online provides our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores, their homes or offices.  We believe this capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located.

We offer proprietary, private label credit cards for individuals and business customers.  In addition, we accept cash, checks, debit cards, Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit cards and gift cards.

Store Environment

Our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies.  Stores utilize several layouts, designed to provide an open environment, optimal product placement and visual display locations. In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be easily changed for seasonal products and promotions. Display and product placement information is sent to stores weekly to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores.  Informative signs are located throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.  These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing and useful information regarding product benefits and suggestions for 
appropriate accessories. The general uniformity of our store layouts and visual displays afford our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhances the shopping experience. To further enhance the shopping experience, all of our store team members wear highly visible red vests, aprons or smocks and nametags, and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located.



Merchandising

We offer a differentiated assortment of products for our customers.  Our broad product assortment is tailored to meet the regional and geographic needs of our markets, as well as the physical store size.  Our full line of product offerings is supported by a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of 15,500 to 19,000 unique products per store.  No one product accounted for more than 10% of our sales during 2010.

Our stores carry a wide selection of high quality, nationally recognized, name brand merchandise. We also market a growing list of products under our “private-label programs,” i.e. products manufactured for us by a number of vendors. The trademarks in the private label brand names are owned by us. Our private label brands include:

·

Producers Pride

and

Dumor

(livestock feed)

·

Retriever, Paws ‘n Claws,

and

4health

(pet foods)

·

Huskee

(outdoor power equipment)

·

C.E. Schmidt

(apparel and footwear)

·

Countyline

(livestock, farm and ranch equipment)

·

Royal Wing

(bird feeding supplies)

·

Traveller

(truck/automotive products)

·

Masterhand

and

JobSmart

(tools and tool chests)

·

Groundwork

(lawn and garden supplies)

·

Bit & Bridle

(apparel)

·

Red Shed

(gifts and collectibles)

We believe that the availability of high quality private label products at compelling prices provides superior value for our customers, a strategic advantage for us, and positions us as a destination store.

The following chart indicates the average percentages of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Purchasing

We offer a differentiated assortment of products that are sourced through domestic and international vendors for those seeking to enjoy the “

Out Here

” lifestyle.  Our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors.  We purchase our products from a core group of approximately 700 vendors, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2010.  Approximately 250 vendors accounted for approximately 90% of our purchases during fiscal 2010.  We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products, and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our produc
ts.  We have no material long-term contractual commitments with any of our vendors.

We maintain a dedicated inventory management team to focus exclusively on all forecasting and replenishment functions.  This centralized direction permits our buying teams to focus more strategic attention toward vendor line reviews, assortment planning and testing of new products and programs.  Through the combined efforts of these teams, we have improved our overall inventory productivity and in-stock position.

Over 98% of our purchase orders are transmitted through an electronic data interchange ("EDI") system, and approximately 95% of merchandise vendor invoices are transmitted through EDI. We are expanding the percentage of vendors who electronically transmit invoices and increasing the amount of sales history transmitted.

Distribution

We currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with merchandise, and in fiscal 2010 our stores received approximately 67% of our merchandise through this network.  Our six distribution centers are located in Indiana, Georgia, Maryland, Texas, Nebraska, and Washington, representing total distribution capacity of 2.9 million square feet.  In 2011 we have begun construction on our seventh distribution center, a new 834,000 square foot facility in Kentucky to be operational during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.

We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a web-based transportation management system.  We utilize several common carriers for store deliveries.  We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, the monitoring of transportation routes, and the scheduling of deliveries.

Marketing

We utilize an "everyday value prices" strategy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by promotions primarily implemented during peak selling seasons.  We regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate.

To generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars, customer targeted direct mail and internet offerings.  Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions, honoring coupons and funding gift card rebate programs.



Due to the relatively small size of our stores, increased traffic in the store ensures increased exposure to our products. Our vendors are committed to helping us promote our brand and position ourselves as a destination store.  Our vendors provide assistance with product presentation and rack design, brochures, point-of-purchase materials for customers’ education and product education for our team members.  We also receive funding through contributions and incentives on purchases to promote new stores and earn rebates from vendors on product purchases based on volume.

Competition

We operate in a competitive retail industry. The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service. We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers, as well as independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives.  Some of these competitors are units of national or regional chains and may have substantially greater resources and financial capacities than we do.  However, we believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from these entities by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle.

Management and Team Members

As of December 25, 2010, we employed approximately 7,900 full-time and approximately 6,800 part-time team members. We also employ additional part-time team members during peak periods.  We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.

Our store operations are organized into nine regions, including Del’s.  Each region is led by a regional manager and the region is further organized into districts, which are led by a district manager or area manager.  Our regional managers, district managers, area managers, store managers and other distribution and support personnel have contributed significantly to our performance.  We have internal advisory boards, one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers.  These groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chain-wide endorsement of proposed “best-practice” solutions.

We are committed to a continuous improvement program called Tractor Value System (“TVS”).  TVS is a business management system that emphasizes, through team member engagement, a focus on continuous improvement.  Utilizing the TVS system, we improve processes by embracing change of current practices to reduce cost, shorten lead times, and drive innovation.  We have implemented numerous continuous improvement project teams (comprised of team members from all areas of our operations) to evaluate key operations and implement process changes that will improve efficiency, reduce costs and strengthen processes. Our management encourages the participation of all team members in decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improv
ement activities.

All of our team members participate in one of various incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company performance. We also provide our team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan (we contribute to the 401(k) savings plan solely through a cash match). Additionally, we share in the cost of health insurance provided to our team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased at our stores.

We encourage a “promote from within” environment when internal resources permit.  We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high potential team members for continued progress and believe we have satisfactory relationships with our team members. Our district managers, area managers, and store managers have an average length of service of approximately five years.  Management believes internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned store growth.

Management Information and Control Systems

We have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to ensure superior customer service, manage the purchase and distribution of our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies. Our management information and control systems include a point-of-sale system, a supply chain management and replenishment system, a radio frequency and voice picking system in the distribution centers, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system. These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system.  This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.

We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness. Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance.  We plan to upgrade our information technology and implement other efficiency-driving system enhancements (including the rollout of a new warehouse management system to distribution centers, implementation of price optimization software, point-of-sale system upgrades, and store and support center hardware refreshes) in 2011.  In addition, we will continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and support the areas of store and distribution center expansion.  These efforts are directed toward constantly improving the overall business processes 
and achieving the most efficient and effective use of the systems to manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment.

Growth Strategy

Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through assortment management, vendor management, global sourcing, and optimization of transportation  and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth.

We have experienced considerable sales growth over the past five years, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.0%.  We project an increase of 80 to 85 new stores in 2011, an increase of approximately 8%.  We opened 74 new stores in 2010 and 76 new stores in 2009, an increase of approximately 8% and 9%, respectively.

We operated 1,001 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 25, 2010.  We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 800 potential additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores in the United States.

Item 1A

.

Risk Factors

Our business faces many risks. Those risks which we are currently aware and we deem to be material are described below.  If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.  These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K.

General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.

Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability.  Additionally, changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales, along with slower 
inventory turnover and greater markdowns on inventory, could adversely affect our operations and operating results.



Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.

Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.  We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services.  Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.  Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competiti
ve vendors without sacrificing quality.  Due to the competitive environment, such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance.

There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase sales at our existing stores.

We experience fluctuations in our same-store sales, which are defined as stores which have completed twelve months of sales.  Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to improve sales at our existing stores.  Various factors affect same-store sales, including the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our merchandise mix, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions.  These factors may cause our same-store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.  Past same-store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our same-store sale
s will not decrease in the future.

Even if we are able to implement, to a significant degree, our key business strategy of expanding our store base, we may experience managerial or operational problems, which may prevent any expected increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow. To manage our planned expansion, we must ensure the continuing adequacy of our existing systems, controls and procedures, including product distribution facilities, store management, financial controls and information systems. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.

Capital requirements for growth may not be available.

The construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and the development of new production and distribution facilities, along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores, require significant amounts of capital. In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through bank borrowings and internally generated cash flow.

Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.  Our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.  Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.  In addition, tighter lending practices have made it more challenging for our real estate developers to obtain financing under reasonable loan terms and conditions.  Unfavorable lending trends could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new purpose-built store
s in desirable locations.

Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.  Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.  Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases or other discretionary uses of cash.

Failure to open new stores in the manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.

An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our base of stores by opening new stores. This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers for such sites.  If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly. To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.

New stores may negatively impact our results.

There can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the Company. New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores. As we continue to open new stores, there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs.

Competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.

We operate in a very competitive market. The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service.  We believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from general merchandise retailers, home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche. However, we do face competition from these entities, as well as competition from independently-owned retail farm and ranch stores, privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives.  Some of our competitors are units of national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources.

Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.

Historically, weather conditions have had a significant impact on our operating results. Weather conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.  In past years, we have experienced extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes and droughts in some states. Weather conditions also directly affect the demand for seasonal products, particularly during the winter heating season. Accordingly, the weather can have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

There are certain risks associated with the seasonal nature of our business.

Our working capital needs and borrowings (if necessary) generally peak in our first and third fiscal quarters because lower sales are generated while expenses are incurred and inventory is increased in preparation for the spring and winter selling seasons.  If cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities are insufficient to meet the seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and winter is insufficient to repay associated borrowings on a timely basis, this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our business.



There is no assurance that our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis will provide expected results.

We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing.  There is no assurance that we will be successful, or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner to satisfy our customers’ needs or expectations.  Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Additionally, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for merchandise.  If we misjudge the market, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to
 take significant inventory markdowns.  Shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results.

We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.

The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.  As a general rule, we have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.  Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors.

We rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.  In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.  We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no long-term contracts with such suppliers.  Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.  This reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, restrictive actions by foreign governments, or changes in United States laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution.  Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shu
t down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which in some cases would make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.

As an importer, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.  If any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional United States quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Our failure to attract and retain qualified team members could adversely affect our financial performance.

Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.  Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment legislation.  If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.

We may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.

Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.  We maintain general liability insurance with a deductible for each occurrence and a $36,000,000 aggregate retention applicable to all general liability and workers compensation claims.  We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability cover.  In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance.  Our ability to recover under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a claim.  No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ indemni
ty will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.

Our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in federal, state or local regulations.

Changes in the federal, state or local minimum wage or living wage requirements or changes in other wage or workplace regulations could increase our costs of doing business. In addition, changes in federal, state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products or tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business.

Because we are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations, we could incur substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other costs.

We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security and employment law matters. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributers, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs. In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.

A privacy breach could result in negative publicity and adversely affect the Company’s business.

The protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to the Company.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements.  In connection with credit card sales, we transmit confidential credit card information.  Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this customer information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively preclude others from obtaining improper access to this information.  Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation.

In addition, states and the federal government are increasingly enacting laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft.  We collect personal information from consumers in the course of doing business.  These laws will likely increase the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business.

Legal proceedings could materially impact our results.

From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.  Our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings.



If we experience difficulties with our management information systems, our financial performance may be adversely affected.

We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.  We could be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.  Many of our information systems contain confidential customer, Company or employee data.  If we fail to adequately restrict access to this information, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other state and local taxing authorities. A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.  These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance. 
Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.

Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to li
tigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.

Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates or judgments.  Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.

Legal Proceedings

The Company received and responded to a Request for Information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) relating to certain recreational vehicles and non-road spark ignition engines sold by the Company.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Environmental Enforcement Section of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), on behalf of the EPA, informed the Company that it believed the Company had violated the Clean Air Act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines not covered by certificates of conformity issued by the EPA, and that unless the DOJ and the Company were able to reach a settlement, the DOJ was prepared to commence a civil action. The Company is currently engaged in settlement discussions with the DOJ that would call for the payment of a civil penalty and c
ertain injunctive relief.  The engines were purchased by the Company pursuant to agreements with vendors under which the vendors represented that their products complied with all applicable laws and regulations and under which the vendors agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities or costs relating to, among other matters, the noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of their products.  The Company has notified these vendors of the EPA’s position and expects to be reimbursed for any liabilities or costs relating to this matter.  The Company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

We are also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  We expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  We believe that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.  It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings.

The number of shares purchased and the average price paid per share shown in the table above have been adjusted to reflect the effect of a two-for-one stock split for all shares purchased prior to the stock split record date.  Actual shares of 73,100, 149,311, and 230,100 were added to treasury in the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, respectively, as the number of shares held in treasury was not adjusted for the two-for-one stock split as stated in Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

(b)

We withheld 25,982 (split adjusted) shares during the first quarter and 2,999 shares during the fourth quarter to satisfy employee tax obligations on the vesting of restricted stock units in the amounts of $0.7 million in the first quarter and $0.1 million in the fourth quarter at an average price of $25.30 and $42.00, respectively.  For further discussion, see Note 2 – Share-Based Compensation in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

We expect to implement the balance of the repurchase program through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private transactions, in accordance with regulations of the SEC.  The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.

Any additional share repurchase programs will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.  The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.

There were no dividends declared during fiscal 2009.

On February 4, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of the Company’s common stock.  The dividend will be paid on March 8, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2011.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. We operate retail stores under the names

Tractor Supply Company

and

Del’s Farm Supply

and operate a website under the name

TractorSupply.com

. Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:

·

Equine, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment;

·

Hardware, truck, towing and tool products;

·

Seasonal products, including lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys;

·

Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; and

·

Work/recreational clothing and footwear.

Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,500 to 18,500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space. We use a standard 15,500 square foot prototype for new purpose-built locations.  For new stores located in existing buildings, one of several layout formats is utilized.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del’s, operated 26 stores as of December 25, 2010 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Hawaii. Del’s stores currently range in size from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and covered/sheltered selling space.

Our current and long-term growth strategy is to:  (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through assortment management, vendor management, sourcing and optimization of transportation  and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth.

We have experienced considerable sales growth over the past five years, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.0%.  We project an increase of 80 to 85 new stores in 2011, an increase of approximately 8%.  We opened 74 new stores in 2010 and 76 new stores in 2009, an increase of approximately 8% and 9%, respectively.

We operated 1,001 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 25, 2010.  We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 800 potential additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores in the United States.

The average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2010 was $1.2 million for retrofit stores and $0.9 million for prototype stores. A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment), and approximately $92,000 for pre-opening costs.

We have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. We believe these efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store team members, have enhanced our sales and financial performance.

Change in Accounting Method

Effective December 25, 2010, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for inventories from the lower of cost, as determined by the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method, or market to the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.  The Company believes the change is preferable as the average cost method better reflects the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets, provides a better reflection of periodic income and improves comparability with our peers.

The Company has applied this change in method of inventory costing retrospectively to all prior periods presented herein in accordance with accounting principles relating to accounting changes.  All financial information in Item 8 of this 10-K has been retrospectively adjusted.  See Note 1,  Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8,  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our change in accounting method.

Stock Split

On July 29, 2010, our Board of Directors announced a two-for-one split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. On September 2, 2010, stockholders of record at the close of business on August 19, 2010, were issued one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder.  The stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 36.3 million to approximately 72.7 million.  Share and per-share amounts (including stock options and restricted stock units) shown in this Form 10-K reflect the split. The total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split.  The number of shares held in treasury was not adjusted for the split.

Seasonality and Weather

Our business is highly seasonal.  Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales.  We believe, however, that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores.

We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season.



Purchase Price Volatility

Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.  We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services.  Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.  Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competiti
ve vendors without sacrificing quality.  Due to the competitive environment, such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance.

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.  In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods 
to reflect more current information.  Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.

Results of Operations

Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.  References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.  The fiscal years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 contain 52 weeks.  All amounts have been adjusted to reflect the Company’s election to change its method of accounting for inventories from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the average cost method.

Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses; refer to Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009

Net sales increased 13.5% to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010 from $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores and a 7.0% increase in same-store sales.  The same-store average daily transaction count increased 7.4%, while same-store transaction value decreased 0.3% for fiscal 2010.

Same-store sales increased 7.0% compared with a same-store sales decrease of 1.1% in the prior year.  This same-store sales increase was broad-based and driven by strong results in core consumable categories, principally animal and pet-related products, as well as seasonal products, including heating, insulated outerwear and outdoor power equipment.

In fiscal 2010, we opened 74 new stores (compared to 76 new stores in fiscal 2009), relocated no stores (compared to two in fiscal 2009) and closed three stores (compared to one store in fiscal 2009).

Gross margin increased 15.5% to $1.20 billion compared to $1.04 billion in 2009.  As a percent of sales, gross margin increased to 33.1% for fiscal 2010 compared to 32.5% for fiscal 2009.  The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to expanded direct product margin and a decrease in shrink, partially offset by increased transportation costs. The direct product margin improvement resulted from continued progress on margin driving initiatives which include strategic sourcing, inventory management, and more effective pricing.

As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 70 basis points to 25.8% in fiscal 2010 from 26.5% in fiscal 2009.  The improvement as a percent to sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense management, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense.

Net interest expense decreased 21.9% to $1.3 million in fiscal 2010 from $1.6 million in fiscal 2009.  This decrease is directly related to lower average borrowings and a decline in interest charges associated with sales tax audits.

Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 36.9% in fiscal 2009. This reduction in the tax resulted from a greater tax benefit received on the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.

As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2010 increased 40.3% to $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $119.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009.

During 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of stock for $38.2 million as part of our previously announced $400 million share repurchase program.  In 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares at a total cost of $15.3 million.  As mentioned in Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies in Part II of this Form 10-K, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008

Net sales increased 6.6% to $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009 from $3.01 billion in fiscal 2008. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores partially offset by a 1.1% decrease in same-store sales.  The same-store average daily transaction count increased 5.3%, while same-store transaction value decreased 6.0% for fiscal 2009.

Same-store sales decreased 1.1% compared with a same-store sales increase of 1.4% in the prior year.  This same-store sales decline was primarily driven by softness in sales of seasonal big ticket (merchandise priced $350 or greater) and discretionary merchandise, partially offset by continued strong results in core consumable categories, including animal and pet-related products.



In fiscal 2009, we opened 76 new stores (compared to 91 new stores in fiscal 2008), relocated two stores (compared to one in fiscal 2008) and closed one store (compared to no stores in fiscal 2008).

Gross margin increased 9.1% to $1,041.9 million compared to $955.1 million in 2008.  As a percent of sales, gross margin increased to 32.5% for fiscal 2009 compared to 31.8% for fiscal 2008.  The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from lower transportation costs.

As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 60 basis points to 24.4% in fiscal 2009 from 23.8% in fiscal 2008. This increase as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the deleveraging related to the same-store sales decrease and higher incentive compensation and occupancy costs, partially offset by reduced marketing costs.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 due mainly to costs associated with new stores.

Net interest expense decreased 22.9% to $1.6 million in fiscal 2009 from $2.1 million in fiscal 2008; however, net interest expense remained consistent as a percent of sales.  This decrease is directly related to lower average borrowings partially offset by higher interest charges associated with sales tax audits.

Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 38.7% in fiscal 2008. This reduction in the tax resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits and a lower percentage of unfavorable permanent tax differences relative to income before taxes.

As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2009 increased 10.9% to $119.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $108.0 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008.

During 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares of stock for $15.3 million as part of our previously announced $400 million share repurchase program.  In 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a total cost of $53.9 million.  As mentioned in Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies in Part II of this Form 10-K, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures.  Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, commitments available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.  Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons, respectively.

Financial markets experienced volatility in the past few years, resulting in disruptions in credit and lending activities.  Further, disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments.  Our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments.  Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time.  We have a diversified banking group which we believe should help mitigate any potential disruptions, if one occurs.

Working Capital

At December 25, 2010, we had working capital of $617.1 million, a $141.2 million increase from December 26, 2009.  This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):

In comparison to prior year end, working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in cash and inventory. The increase in cash resulted principally from stronger earnings. The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth. Average inventory per store remained nearly flat at $709,000 for fiscal 2010 compared to $707,000 for fiscal 2009. This was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses principally as a result of timing of payments and higher incentive compensation accruals over the prior year.

Accounts payable has declined as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account, which nets against accounts payable, as well as more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by our vendors. Trade credit arises from our vendors granting payment terms for inventory purchases.  Payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product.  Certain vendors offer payment discounts for payments made within a shorter period, typically within 10 to 15 days.



Borrowings and Credit Facilities

We are party to a Senior Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for borrowings up to $350 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively).  The Credit Agreement has an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments).  The Credit Agreement is unsecured and matures in February 2012, with proceeds expected to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases.

At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.  There were $27.4 million and $35.2 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively.  Borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate (3.25% at December 25, 2010) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) (0.26% at December 25, 2010) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.40% at December 25, 2010).  We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, for unused capacity (0.075% at December 25, 2010).   There are no com
pensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants:  a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.  The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense (“consolidated EBITDAR”) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding straight-line rent).  The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.  The Credit Agreement also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiar
ies or affiliates, and liens.  We were in compliance with all covenants at December 25, 2010.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations.  Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt, repurchase of the Company’s common stock, and payment of common stock dividends.  The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):

Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stronger net income and an increase in accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in inventory, net of accounts payable, and an increase in prepaids and other current assets. Continued store growth has resulted in increased inventory balances.  Accounts payable levels have decreased as a result of more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by vendors and also as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account.  The bank concentration account nets against the related book overdraft included in accounts payable. Accrued expenses increased as a result of timing of pa
yments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2010 but not paid until fiscal 2011.

The $2.4 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):

The decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments, partially offset by higher net income and an increase in accrued expenses.  Inventory levels remained nearly flat in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a continued focus on inventory management in 2009. Accounts payable levels have decreased substantially as a result of more timely payments to capture payment discounts offered by vendors. Accrued expenses increased as a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2009 but not paid until fiscal 2010.

Investing Activities

Investing activities used $112.1 million, $73.8 million and $88.4 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures.  Our significant store expansion, coupled with required investment in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures, including capital leases (in millions):

Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets.  This growth will also require continuing investment in information technology.  The costs reflected above are typically building improvements, as we lease the majority of our facilities.  We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $150 million and $160 million in fiscal 2011.  While we plan to open only a few more stores in 2011 compared to 2010, we expect to have additional capital expenditures next year as we construct a new distribution center and implement a comprehensive warehouse management system designed to improve throughput and efficiencies in the distribution center network, along with other efficiency-driving system enhancements in
 2011.

Financing Activities

Financing activities used $26.0 million, $5.6 million, and $105.5 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2010 is mainly the result of quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders and repurchases of common stock, partially offset by increased net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation.

We have a Board-approved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2011.  The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.  Repurchased shares will be held in treasury.  The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.

We repurchased approximately 0.8 million, 0.4 million and 1.6 million shares under the share repurchase program for a total cost of $38.2 million, $15.3 million and $53.9 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  As mentioned in Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies in Part II of this Form 10-K, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split.  Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.  As of December 25, 2010, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $142.8 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.

We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Credit Agreement, and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including store openings, relocations and renovations, over the next several years.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.  The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets.  Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810 (originally issued as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 46(R)”).  Among other items, ASC 810 responds to concerns about an enterprise’s application of certain key provisions of FIN 46(R), including those regarding the transparency of the enterprise’s involvement with variable interest entities.  ASC 810 is effective for the first annual period that begins after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period.  The Company adopted the standard for the interim period ended March 27, 2010.  There was no impact on the C
ompany’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.

In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-09 (ASU No. 2010-09), “Subsequent Events (Topic 855):  Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements.”  The amendments remove the requirements for an SEC filer to disclose a date, in both issued and revised financial statements, through which subsequent events have been reviewed.  Revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of U.S. GAAP.  ASU No. 2010-09 was effective upon issuance.  The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank’s base rate (3.25% at both December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009) or LIBOR (0.26% and 0.23% at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly, based on our performance (0.40% and 0.50% at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively).  We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.075% at December 25, 2010 and 0.10% December 26, 2009).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Tractor Supply Company

We have audited Tractor Supply Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Tractor Supply Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations o
f management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on

the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010 and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Tractor Supply Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply Company at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for inventory from the lower of cost, as determined by the last-in first-out (LIFO) method, or market, to the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market, effective December 25, 2010.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Tractor Supply Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies

:

Nature of Business

Tractor Supply Company (the “Company”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States.  We are focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  Stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del’s Farm Supply, LLC (“Del’s”) operated 26 stores as of December 25, 2010.  At December 25, 2010, we operated a total of 1,001 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states and also offered a number of products online at

TractorSupply.com

.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year and includes 52 or 53 weeks.  The fiscal years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 consist of 52 weeks.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.  All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Change in Accounting Method

Effective December 25, 2010, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for inventories from lower of cost, as determined by the LIFO method, or market, to lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.  The Company believes the change is preferable as the average cost method better reflects the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets, provides a better reflection of periodic income and improves comparability with our peers.

The Company has applied this change in method of inventory costing retrospectively to all prior periods presented herein in accordance with accounting principles relating to accounting changes.  As a result of the retrospective change in accounting principle, opening retained earnings as of December 29, 2007 increased by $15.6 million.  The effect of the change in method on previously reported consolidated operating results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 was to increase net income by $4.3 million ($0.05  per dilutive share), and $26.1 million ($0.35 per dilutive share), respectively.  The effect on the consolidated balance sheet at December 26, 2009 was to increase inventory, tax liabilities and retained earnings by $75.2 million, $29.3 million and $45.9 million, respectively.

Certain components of the Company’s financial statements affected by the change in costing methodology as originally reported under the LIFO method and as adjusted for the change to the average cost method are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

*     As described below, certain other amounts in the previously issued balance sheet have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation.



Stock Split

On July 29, 2010, our Board of Directors announced a two-for-one split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. On September 2, 2010, stockholders of record at the close of business on August 19, 2010, were issued one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder.  The stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 36.3 million to approximately 72.7 million.  Share and per-share amounts (including stock options and restricted stock units) shown in the consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect the split. The total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split.  The number of shares held in treasury was not adjusted for the split
.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation.  Marketing support fund receivables due from vendors previously classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets have been reclassified to reduce vendor accounts payable ($11.6 million at December 26, 2009).  Amounts related to accrued employee compensation ($22.7 million at December 26, 2009) have been reclassified from other accrued expenses to accrued employee compensation.  A portion of the liabilities related to self-insured workers’ compensation and general liability claims ($14.0 million at December 26, 2009) previously classified in other accrued expenses have been reclassified to other long-term liabilities to reflect their long-term status.  Also amou
nts related to tenant improvement allowances ($18.0 million at December 26, 2009) previously classified in other long-term liabilities and amounts related to straight-line rent ($45.5 million at December 26, 2009) previously classified as straight-line rent liability have been reclassified as deferred rent to conform to the December 25, 2010 presentation.

These changes have affected our December 26, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008.

Segment Information

Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment which is the operation of farm and ranch retail stores.  We also offer a number of products online at

.

Management Estimates

Our preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently requires estimates and assumptions by us that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas:

Revenue Recognition and Sales Returns

We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.  If we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise (as per our special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete.

We are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental entity on a periodic basis.  These taxes are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.  We record a liability upon collection from the customer and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.

We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.  Our estimation methodologies have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.  At December 25, 2010 we had a liability of $3.0 million reserved for sales returns, compared to $3.1 million at December 26, 2009.

We recognize revenue when a gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognize income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as “breakage”).  The gift card and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift card and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.  We recognized income of $1.6 million, $1.1 million and $1.4 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Inventory Valuation

Inventory Impairment Risk

We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.  The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e. an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.  However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.

Shrinkage

We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.  The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods’ sales volumes.  Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.   The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.  We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends.

Vendor Support

We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs.  The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years.  Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor’s product.  Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.

During the interim periods, the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.  The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.  Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could differ significantly from the previously estimated amounts.

Freight

We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.  Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.

Share-Based Compensation

We have share-based compensation plans, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and an employee stock purchase plan, covering certain members of management and non-employee directors.

We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a

Black-Scholes

option pricing model. The

Black-Scholes

option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. However, key assumptions used in the

Black-Scholes

model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards. Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life. 
We rely on historical volatility trends to estimate future volatility assumptions.  The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. The expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on our historical experience for similar options.

In addition to the key assumptions used in the

Black-Scholes

model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period. We adjust this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.

We believe our estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.  Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises.

Self-Insurance Reserves

We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers’ compensation and general liability insurance plans.  We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers’ compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Therefore, we estimate potential obligations for liabilities that have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data and experience. Although we believe the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  At December 25, 2010
, we had recorded net insurance reserves of $29.0 million compared to $23.7 million at December 26, 2009.

Sales Tax Audit Reserve

A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.  We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.  Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.  The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.  These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.  While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, will not have a significant liabil
ity for disallowed exemptions.

We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.  Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to-date experience with each audit. As each audit progresses, we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors, adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.   The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.



Tax Contingencies

Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant ta
x authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

We recognize a liability for certain tax benefits that do not meet the minimum requirements for recognition in the financial statements.

Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met.

Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.

Credit Cards/Accounts Receivable

Sales generated through our private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.  Under an agreement with Citi Cards, a division of Citigroup (“Citigroup”), consumer and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup.  All credit program and related services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup.

Pre-opening Costs

Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new store and distribution centers, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.  Preopening costs were approximately $7.1 million, $7.5 million and $8.7 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Store Closing Costs

We regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are under-performing.  We record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.  Store closing costs were not significant to results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.  The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit card transactions process within 24-48 hours and are accordingly classified as cash and cash equivalents.

Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term receivables, trade payables and long-term debt instruments.  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value.  We had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009.

Our short-term investment in a U.S. Treasury note is classified as Level 1 as these types of investments trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.  The U.S. Treasury note is held as collateral for a standby letter of credit and is expected to be held to maturity.  The fair value of short-term investments at December 25, 2010 was $15.9 million.  We had no short-term investments at December 26, 2009.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.  Inventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight.  Inventories are net of shrinkage, obsolescence, other valuations and vendor allowances.

Vendor Concentration

Approximately 250 vendors accounted for 90% of our purchases for fiscal 2010, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of purchases during the year.

Cost of Merchandise Sold

Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our vendors to our distribution centers; from our distribution centers to our retail stores; and from one distribution center to another; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage (physical inventory losses), lower of cost or market valuation, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution center and corporate employees; occupancy costs of retail, distribution center and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging.

Warehousing and Distribution Costs

Costs incurred at our distribution centers for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SG&A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Company’s gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.  Distribution center costs for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $64.4 million, $59.0 million and $52.8 million, respectively.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are carried at cost.  Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.  Leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the term of the lease (including the first renewal option, if the renewal is reasonably assured) or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.  The following estimated useful lives are generally applied:

Life

Buildings

30 – 35 years

Leasehold and building improvements

5 – 35 years

Furniture, fixtures and equipment

5 – 10 years

Computer software and hardware

3 –   5 years

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution center and corporate assets.  Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets.

Capitalized Software Costs

The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years.  These costs are included in computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.

Leases

Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with our normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Certain leases include rent increases during the initial lease term.  For these leases, we recognize the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement) and record the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability.

We occasionally receive reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.  Reimbursements are primarily for the purpose of performing work required to divide a much larger location into smaller segments, one of which we will use for our store.  This work could include the addition of demising walls, separation of plumbing, utilities, electric work, entrances (front and back) and other work as required.  Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs including items reimbursed by landlords.  Related reimbursements are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the initial lease term.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.  The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.  If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the ass
et’s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset.



In fiscal 2010, the company recognized impairment charges of $1.1 million related to the write-off of certain capitalized software development costs.  These assets were not expected to provide any future benefit to the Company and were determined to have no significant fair value.  During fiscal year 2009 impairment charges of $0.8 million were recorded representing the amount required to write-down the carrying value of certain leasehold improvements to the assets’ estimated fair value. Impairment charges are included in SG&A expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2008.

Goodwill

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized.  We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate.  All goodwill at December 25, 2010 is associated with the Company as a whole.  At December 26, 2009 all goodwill was associated with the Del’s business and, for purposes of the fiscal 2009 impairment testing, Del’s was considered the reporting unit.  In October 2010, we reevaluated the Del’s reporting unit and concluded that since Del’s has be
come closely aligned in terms of management, infrastructure, philosophy and performance, we now have only one reporting unit for goodwill impairment evaluation.

The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process.  The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.  The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.  If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to our operations.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and determined there was no impairment. We determined that the fair value of the reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary.  In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a market approach.  Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars, television and radio, as well as direct mail, newspaper advertisements and other promotions.  Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.  Advertising expenses for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $48.6 million, $45.7 million and $58.0 million, respectively.

Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Net Income Per Share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  Diluted shares are computed using the treasury stock method for options and restricted stock units.

Note 2 - Share-Based Compensation:

Share-based compensation includes stock option and restricted stock unit awards and certain transactions under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”).   Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on grant date fair value of all options and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.  The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the grant date market value and the employee’s purchase price.

Share-based compensation expense including reductions in expense for modifications of awards was $11.8 million, $12.1 million and $12.3 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.

Effective May 7, 2009, the Company adopted the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan replacing the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.  Following the adoption of the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, no further grants may be made under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.

Under our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to officers, non-employee directors and other employees.  The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.  Also, the aggregate fair market value of the stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable on a tax deferred basis for the first time by an individual in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000.  Vesting of options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.

Under the terms of the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, a maximum of 6,200,000 shares are available for grant as stock options or other awards.  At December 25, 2010, we had 5,146,530 shares available for future equity awards under the Company’s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.



The fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each vesting date.  The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.  We have estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a

Black-Scholes

pricing valuation model.  The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.  The weighted averages for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:

Expected Price Volatility

—

This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. We use actual historical changes in the market value of the stock to calculate expected price volatility because we believe that this is the best indicator of future volatility.  We calculate daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.  An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.

Risk-Free Interest Rate —

This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.

Weighted Average Expected Lives —

This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience. Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years. An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.

Forfeiture Rate —

This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully vested. This estimate is based on historical experience. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.

Dividend Yield —

This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.

For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements that we pay on behalf of our employees.  We issued 90,203, 10,896, and 2,020 shares as a result of vested restricted stock units during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The 2010 amount is net of 28,981 shares, withheld to satisfy $0.8 million of employees’ tax obligations.  Although shares withheld are not issued, they are treated similar to common stock repurchases as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting.

There were no material modifications to restricted stock units in 2010, 2009, or 2008.

As of December 25, 2010, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units is $4,705,000 with a weighted average expense recognition period of 1.7 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The ESPP provides our employees the opportunity to purchase, through payroll deductions, shares of common stock at a 15% discount.  Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, we issued 74,788, 101,470 and 122,696 shares of common stock during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  The total cost related to the ESPP, including the compensation expense calculations, was approximately $439,000, $449,000 and $485,000 in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  In connection with the stock split, the number of shares of our common stock that are reserved under the ESPP increased from 4,000,000 shares to 8,000,000 shares.  At December 25, 2010, there were 6,299,852 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.

There were no significant modifications to the Company's share-based compensation plans during fiscal 2010.

Note 3 - Credit Agreement:

We are party to a Senior Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group (the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for borrowings up to $350 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively).  The Credit Agreement has an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments).  The Credit Agreement is unsecured and matures in February 2012, with proceeds expected to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases.

At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.  There were $27.4 million and $35.2 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively.  Borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate (3.25% at December 25, 2010) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (0.26% at December 25, 2010) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.40% at December 25, 2010).  We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, for unused capacity (0.075% at December 25, 2010).   There are no 
compensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants:  a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.  The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares consolidated EBITDAR to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding straight-line rent).  The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.  The Credit Agreement also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.  We were in compliance with all covenants at December 25, 2010.



Note 4 - Leases:

We lease the majority of our office space and retail store locations, certain distribution centers, transportation equipment and other equipment under various noncancellable operating leases.  The leases have varying terms and expire at various dates through 2029 and 2025 for capital leases and operating leases, respectively.  Store leases typically have initial terms of between 10 and 15 years, with two to four optional renewal periods of five years each.  Some leases require the payment of contingent rent that is based upon store sales above agreed-upon sales levels for the year.  The sales levels vary for each store and are established in the lease agreements.  Generally, most of the leases also require that we pay associated taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.

Total rent expense for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $169.4 million, $162.2 million and $144.4 million, respectively.  Total contingent rent expense for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was insignificant.

Future minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more consist of the following (in thousands):

Note 5 - Capital Stock:

The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of common stock and preferred stock.  The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock.  The Company is also authorized to issue 40,000 shares of Preferred Stock, with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.

Note 6 - Treasury Stock:

We have a Board-approved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2011. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.  Repurchased shares will be held in treasury.  The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.

We repurchased 0.8 million, 0.4 million and 1.6 million shares under the share repurchase program for a total cost of $38.2 million, $15.3 million and $53.9 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  As mentioned in Note 1, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split.  As of December 25, 2010, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $142.8 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.

The Company and its affiliates file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and local jurisdictions.  With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005.  Various states have completed an examination of our income tax returns for 2001 through 2008.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate, is $3.7 million at December 25, 2010. In addition, we recognize current interest and penalties accrued related to these uncertain tax positions as interest expense, and the amount is not material to the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Note 9 - Retirement Benefit Plans:

We have a defined contribution benefit plan, the Tractor Supply Company 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the “Plan”), which provides retirement benefits for our employees.  Employees become eligible on the first month following their fulfillment of the eligibility requirements.  To be eligible, an employee must be at least 21 years of age, have completed 12 months of employment, and performed 1,000 hours of service in a year of service as defined by the Plan.  We match (in cash) 100% of the employee’s elective contributions up to 3% of the employee’s eligible compensation plus 50% of the employee’s elective contributions from 3% to 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation.  In no event shall the total Company match made on behalf of the employee exceed 4.5% of
 the employee’s eligible compensation.  All current contributions are immediately 100% vested.  Company contributions to the Plan during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, were approximately $3.7 million, $3.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

We offer, through a deferred compensation program, the opportunity for certain qualifying employees to elect a deferral of up to 40% of their annual base salary and up to 100% of their annual incentive bonus under their respective incentive bonus programs.  To be eligible for the salary deferral, each participant must contribute the maximum amount of salary to the Plan subject to the Company’s match.  Under the deferred compensation program, the participants’ salary deferral is matched by the Company, 100% on the first $3,000 of base salary contributed and 50% on the next $3,000 of base salary contributed limited to a maximum annual matching contribution of $4,500.  Each participant’s account earns simple annual interest at the prime rate as in effect on January 1 each year.  Ea
ch participant is fully vested in all amounts credited to their deferred compensation account.  Payments under the program, which are made in cash and paid in ten annual installments or in a single lump sum payment at the election of the participant, are made within 30 days following the earlier of the participant’s (i) death, (ii) retirement, plus six months if the participant is a key employee, (iii) total and permanent disability, (iv) separation from service, plus six months if the participant is a key employee, or (v) some other date designated by the participant at the time of the initial deferral. The Company’s contributions, including accrued interest, were $0.3 million in each of the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies:

Construction and Real Estate Commitments

At December 25, 2010, we had commitments related to construction projects for new stores and a distribution center totaling approximately $32.2 million.

Litigation

The Company received and responded to a Request for Information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) relating to certain recreational vehicles and non-road spark ignition engines sold by the Company.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Environmental Enforcement Section of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), on behalf of the EPA, informed the Company that it believed the Company had violated the Clean Air Act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines not covered by certificates of conformity issued by the EPA, and that unless the DOJ and the Company were able to reach a settlement, the DOJ was prepared to commence a civil action. The Company is currently engaged in settlement discussions with the DOJ that would call for the payment of a civil penalty and c
ertain injunctive relief.  The engines were purchased by the Company pursuant to agreements with vendors under which the vendors represented that their products complied with all applicable laws and regulations and under which the vendors agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities or costs relating to, among other matters, the noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of their products.  The Company has notified these vendors of the EPA’s position and expects to be reimbursed for any liabilities or costs relating to this matter.   The Company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

We are also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.  Management expects these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  We believe that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.  It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings.

Note 11 - Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810 (originally issued as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, “Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 46(R)”).  Among other items, ASC 810 responds to concerns about an enterprise’s application of certain key provisions of FIN 46(R), including those regarding the transparency of the enterprise’s involvement with variable interest entities.  ASC 810 is effective for the first annual period that begins after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period.  The Company adopted the standard for the interim period ended March 27, 2010.  There was no impact on the C
ompany’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures.

In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-09 (ASU No. 2010-09), “Subsequent Events (Topic 855):  Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements.”  The amendments remove the requirements for an SEC filer to disclose a date, in both issued and revised financial statements, through which subsequent events have been reviewed.  Revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of U.S. GAAP.  ASU No. 2010-09 was effective upon issuance.  The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 12 – Subsequent Events:

On February 4, 2011, we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of the Company’s common stock.  The dividend will be paid on March 8, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2011.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act) as of December 25, 2010.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow 
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 25, 2010, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act.  The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework.  Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 25, 2010, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
