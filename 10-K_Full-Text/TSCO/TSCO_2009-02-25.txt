PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview

Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States
and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who
enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. We operate retail stores
under the names

Tractor Supply Company

and

Del’s Farm Supply

and operate a website under the name

TractorSupply.com

. References to our website do not constitute incorporation by reference of the
information contained on the website. Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan
markets and in rural communities and offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise:

•

Equine, pet and animal products, including items necessary for their health, care,
growth and containment;

•

Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use;

•

Hardware and tool products;

•

Seasonal products, including lawn and garden power equipment;

•

Truck and towing products; and

•

Work/recreational clothing and footwear for the entire family.

Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,500 square feet to 18,500 square feet of
inside selling space and additional outside selling space. We are developing stores using several
standard prototypes as well as existing building structures.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del’s Farm Supply, LLC (“Del’s”), which operated 28 stores as of
December 27, 2008 primarily in the Pacific Northwest, offers a wide selection of products
(primarily in the equine, pet and animal category) tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle.
Del’s stores currently range in size from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 square feet of inside
selling space plus additional outside and covered/sheltered selling space.

Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment — farm and ranch retail sales, both at
our retail locations and online.

At December 27, 2008, we operated 855 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states.

Seasonality and Weather

Our business is seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second
and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable
weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales. We
believe, however, that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the
geographic dispersion of our stores.

We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during the first fiscal quarter
each year for purchases of seasonal products in anticipation of the spring selling season and again
during the third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season.

Business Strategy

We believe our sales and earnings growth is a result of focused execution of our business strategy,
which includes the following key components:

Market Niche

We have identified a specialized market niche: supplying the lifestyle needs of
recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we
refer to as the “

Out Here

” lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
By focusing our product mix on these core customers, we believe we are
differentiated from general merchandise, home center and other specialty retailers.



Customer Service

We are committed to providing our customers a high level of in-store service through
our motivated, well-trained store employees. We believe the ability of our store
employees to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps to promote
strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping. As such, we seek to provide our store
employees with decision-making authority, product knowledge and training to enable
them to meet our customers’ needs.

We endeavor to staff our stores with courteous, highly motivated employees and
devote considerable resources to training store employees, often in cooperation with
our vendors. Our training programs include (i) a full management training program
which covers all aspects of our operations, (ii) product knowledge modules produced
in conjunction with key vendors, (iii) frequent management skills training classes,
(iv) semi-annual store manager meetings with vendor product presentations, (v)
vendor sponsored in-store training programs and (vi) ongoing product information
updates from our management headquarters, the Store Support Center. We seek to hire
and train store employees with farming and ranching backgrounds, with particular
emphasis on general maintenance, equine and welding.

In fiscal 2007, we established our first online shopping site,

TractorSupply.com

.
The availability of many of our products online provides our customers the ability
to purchase products and have them shipped to their homes or offices. This
capability further enhances customer service and extends our market to areas where
retail stores are not currently located.

We offer proprietary, private label credit cards for individuals and business
customers. In addition, we accept cash, checks, debit cards, Visa, MasterCard,
American Express and Discover credit cards and gift cards.

Store Environment

Our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to
maximize sales and operating efficiencies. Stores utilize several layouts, designed
to provide an open environment, optimal product placement and visual display
locations. In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily
reallocated and visual displays to be easily changed for seasonal products and
promotions. Display and product placement information is sent to stores weekly to
ensure quality and uniformity among the stores. Informative signs are located
throughout each store to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise
location by comparison of “good, better, best” qualities, clear pricing and useful
information regarding product benefits and suggestions for appropriate accessories.
The general uniformity of our store layouts and visual displays afford our customers
a feeling of familiarity and enhances the shopping experience. To further enhance
the shopping experience, all of our store employees wear highly visible red vests,
aprons or smocks and nametags, and our customer service and checkout counters are
conveniently located.

Merchandising

We offer a differentiated assortment of products for our customers. Our broad
product assortment is tailored to meet the regional and geographic needs of our
markets, as well as the physical store size. Our full line of product offerings is
supported by a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of 12,500 to
15,000 unique products per store. No one product accounted for more than 10% of our
sales during 2008.



Our stores carry a wide selection of high quality, nationally recognized, name brand
merchandise. We also market a growing list of products under our “private-label
programs,” i.e. products manufactured by a number of vendors at our direction and
specifically for our sole benefit. The trademarks in the private label brand names
are owned by us with the exception of a very limited number of brands over which we
have sole control but have not yet opted to own (“control brands”). Our private
label brands include:

•

Masterhand

and

JobSmart

(tools and tool chests)

•

Dumor

and

Producers Pride

(livestock feed)

•

Retriever

and

Paws ‘n Claws

(pet foods)

•

Royal Wing

(bird feeding supplies)

•

Milepost

(equine products)

•

Groundwork

(lawn and garden supplies)

•

Huskee

(outdoor power equipment)

•

Countyline

(livestock, farm and ranch equipment)

•

Traveller

(truck/automotive products)

•

C.E. Schmidt

(apparel and footwear)

•

Bit & Bridle

(apparel)

•

Red Shed

(gifts and collectibles)

Our control brands include

Morgan Creek

(lifestyle clothing) and

Farm Hand

(air
compressors). We believe that the availability of top quality private label
products at great prices provides superior value for our customers, a strategic
advantage for us, and positions us as a destination store.

Purchasing and Distribution

We offer a differentiated assortment of products that are sourced through domestic
and international vendors for those seeking to enjoy the “

Out Here

” lifestyle. Our
business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors. We
purchase our products from a core group of approximately 850 vendors, with no one
vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2008.
Approximately 250 vendors accounted for approximately 90% of our purchases during
fiscal 2008. We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining
satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products and we believe that
adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for substantially
all of our products. We have no material long-term contractual commitments with any
of our vendors.

We maintain a dedicated inventory management team to focus exclusively on all
replenishment and forecasting functions. This centralized direction permits our
buying teams to focus more strategic attention toward vendor line reviews,
assortment planning and testing of new products and programs. Through the combined
efforts of these teams, we have improved our overall inventory productivity and
in-stock position.

Over 97% of our purchase orders are transmitted through an electronic data
interchange (“EDI”) system, and approximately 93% of merchandise vendor invoices are
transmitted through EDI. We are expanding the percentage of vendors who
electronically transmit invoices and increasing the amount of sales history
transmitted.

We currently operate a distribution network for supplying our stores with
merchandise and in fiscal 2008 our stores received approximately 64% of our
merchandise through this network. Our six distribution centers are located in
Indiana, Georgia, Maryland, Texas, Nebraska, and Washington, representing total
distribution capacity of 2.9 million square feet. This capacity increased by
approximately 347,000 square feet in 2008 due to an expansion of our Waco, Texas
distribution center. In 2009, we are not planning any additional distribution
center square footage as we concentrate on increasing the utilization of our
existing space.



We manage our inbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a
web-based transportation management system. We outsource the operation of our
dedicated fleet to two third-party logistics providers and utilize several common
carriers as required. The third-party logistics providers are responsible for
managing drivers and tractors contracted to us. We control our transportation costs
through the monitoring of transportation routes and scheduling of deliveries and
backhauls while minimizing empty miles.

Marketing

We utilize an “everyday low prices” strategy to consistently offer our products at
competitive prices complemented by promotions to enhance peak selling seasons. We
regularly monitor prices at competing stores and adjust our prices as appropriate.
We believe that by avoiding a “sale-oriented” marketing strategy, we attract
customers on a regular basis rather than only in response to promotional sales.

To generate store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote
broad selections of merchandise, primarily advertised at our regular everyday low
price, with printed color circulars. We also run periodic special events promoted
through circulars and direct mail advertising. We supplement our print marketing
programs and further position our brand with national cable and local television
advertising in select markets. Due to the geographic dispersion of our stores, the
use of national cable advertising is generally more cost-effective and additionally
serves to promote our stores prior to entering a new market.

Due to the relatively small size of our stores, increased traffic in the store
ensures increased exposure to our products. Our vendors are committed to helping us
promote our brand and position ourselves as a destination store. Our vendors
provide assistance with product presentation and rack design, brochures,
point-of-purchase materials for customers’ education and product education for our
employees. We also receive funding through contributions and incentives on
purchases to promote new stores and earn rebates from vendors on product purchases
based on volume.

Competition

We operate in a competitive market. The principal competitive factors include
location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency,
merchandise assortment and presentation and customer service. We compete with
general merchandise retailers, home center retailers and other specialty and
discount retailers, as well as independently owned retail farm and ranch stores,
numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives. Some of
these competitors are units of national or regional chains and may have
substantially greater resources and financial capacities than we do. However, we
believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from these entities by
focusing on our specialized market niche.

Management and Employees

As of December 27, 2008, we employed approximately 7,200 full-time and approximately
5,600 part-time employees. We also employ additional part-time employees during peak
periods. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.

Our store operations are organized by location into eight regions. Each region is
led by a regional manager and the region is further organized into districts, which
are led by a district manager. Our regional and district managers, store managers
and other distribution and support personnel have contributed significantly to our
performance. We have an internal advisory board comprised of store managers. This
group brings a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generates
chain-wide endorsement of proposed “best-practice” solutions. Additionally, we are
committed to a continuous improvement program called Tractor Value System (“TVS”).
TVS is a commitment to provide, through team member engagement, a business
management system that emphasizes
continuous improvement by embracing change of current practices to reduce cost,
shorten lead times, and drive innovation. We have implemented numerous TVS project
teams (comprised of employees from all areas of our operations) to evaluate key
operations and implement process changes that will both improve efficiency and
strengthen controls. Our management encourages the participation of all employees in
decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our employees and
responds to the suggestions.



All of our employees participate in one of various incentive programs, which provide
the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company
performance. We also provide our employees the opportunity to participate in an
employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement plan (we contribute to the
401(k) plan solely through a cash match). Additionally, we share in the cost of
health insurance provided to our employees, and employees receive a discount on
merchandise purchased at our stores.

We encourage a “promote from within” environment when internal resources permit. We
also provide internal leadership development programs designed to mentor our high
potential employees for continued progress and believe we have satisfactory
relationships with our employees. Our district managers and store managers have an
average length of service of approximately five years. Management believes internal
promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience,
will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned store growth.

Management Information and Control Systems

We have invested considerable resources in our management information and control
systems to ensure superior customer service, manage the purchase and distribution of
our merchandise and improve our operating efficiencies. Our management information
and control systems include a point-of-sale system, a supply chain management and
replenishment system, a radio frequency and voice picking system in the distribution
centers, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation
system. These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”)
system. This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale
and interfaces with our financial systems.

We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize
their effectiveness. Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations
and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance.
We plan to upgrade our information technology and implement other
efficiency-driving system enhancements (including a new point-of-sale system) in
2009. These efforts are directed toward constantly improving the overall business
processes and achieving the most efficient and effective use of the systems to
manage our operations while ensuring a secure and reliable environment.

Growth Strategy

Our current and long-term growth strategy is to (1) expand geographic market presence through
opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases,
achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday low prices” philosophy and
supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through assortment management,
vendor management, sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs, (4)
leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead, (5) expand
market opportunities via internet sales, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such
opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary
strategy to organic growth.

We have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years, with a compounded annual
growth rate of approximately 15.4%. We project an increase in our unit count of approximately 8 to
9% for 2009. We believe this unit count increase will contribute substantially to our future
growth. The acquisition of Del’s enabled us to establish an initial presence in the Pacific
Northwest, primarily in Washington and develop a smaller market format.

We operated 855 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 27, 2008 and have plans to
open 70 to 80 stores in fiscal 2009. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites
and have identified over 575 potential
additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores (excluding Del’s) in the United States. We have
slowed the growth of Del’s as we refine the concept, and we do not plan to open any additional
Del’s stores in fiscal 2009.

Item 1A

.

Risk Factors

Our business faces many risks. These risks include those described below and may include
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial.
If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business,
financial condition or results of operations may suffer, and the trading price of our common stock
could decline. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this
Form 10-K.

General economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.

Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact
consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Future economic conditions affecting
disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax
rates, fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or
acts of terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift
their spending to lower-priced competitors. A general reduction in the level of discretionary
spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our
growth and profitability. Additionally, changes in the mix of products sold to a mix with a lower
overall gross margin or other increased cost of sales, along with slower inventory turnover and
greater markdowns on inventory, could adversely affect our operations and operating results.

Purchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures may adversely affect
our financial performance.

Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we
believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both. We are subject to market risk
with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items,
steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services.
Moreover, in the last few years, energy prices have risen dramatically, which has resulted in
increased fuel costs for our business and utility costs for our stores. While the cost of certain
store products and services have decreased during the latter half of 2008, if the cost of these
products and services resume their increase, consumer demand may fall and/or we may not be able to
pass all such increases on to our customers and, as a result, sales and/or gross margins could
decline. Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of inflation and deflation principally
by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of
purchases, increasing retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors
without sacrificing quality. Due to the competitive environment, such conditions have and may
continue to adversely impact our financial performance.



There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase sales at our existing stores.

We experience fluctuations in our same-store sales, which are defined as stores which have
completed twelve months of sales. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to improve sales
at our existing stores. Various factors affect same-store sales, including the general retail
sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, changes in our
merchandise mix, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of release of new merchandise
and promotional events, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. These factors
may cause our same-store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from
expectations. Past same-store sales are not necessarily an indication of future results, and there
can be no assurance that our same-store sales will not decrease in the future. Any failure to meet
the same-store sales expectations of investors and security analysts in one or more future periods
could adversely affect our results of operations and result in a reduction in the market price of
our common stock.

Our failure to effectively manage growth could impair our business.

Even if we are able to implement, to a significant degree, our key business strategy of expanding
our store base, we may experience managerial or operational problems, which may prevent any
significant increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow. To manage our planned
expansion, we must ensure the continuing adequacy of our existing systems, controls and procedures,
including product distribution facilities, store management, financial controls and information
systems. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the
new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be
profitable.

Capital requirements for growth may not be available.

The construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and the development of new production and
distribution facilities, along with the remodeling and renovation of existing stores, require
significant amounts of capital. In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through bank
borrowings and internally generated cash flow.

Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, as have been experienced during 2008, could
adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments. Our access to funds under the
credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet
their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if
they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of
borrowing requests within a short period of time.

Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or
increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could
adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us
to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit
arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include
deferring capital expenditures, and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases or other
discretionary uses of cash.

Failure to open new stores in the manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our
financial performance.

An integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our base of stores by opening
new stores. This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we
face competition from many retailers for such sites. If we are unable to implement this strategy,
our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly. To
the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to site approval
or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.

New stores may negatively impact our results.

There can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales
and profitability for the Company. New stores build their sales volumes and refine their
merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher
operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores. As we continue to open new
stores and the new stores become a larger percentage of our store base, there may be a negative
impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels
ramp to chain average, as well as the impact of related pre-opening costs.

Competition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely
affect our operations.

We operate in a very competitive market. The principal competitive factors include location of
stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and
presentation, and customer service. We believe we have successfully differentiated ourselves from
general merchandise, home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing
on our specialized market niche. However, we do face competition from these entities, as well as
competition from independently-owned retail farm and ranch stores, several privately-held regional
farm store
chains and farm cooperatives. Some of our competitors are units of national or regional chains
that have substantially greater financial and other resources.



Weather conditions may have a significant impact on our financial results.

Historically, weather conditions have had a significant impact on our operating results. Weather
conditions affect the demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an
impact on prices. In recent years, we have experienced unusually severe weather conditions,
including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes and droughts in some
states. Weather conditions also directly affect the demand for seasonal products, particularly
during the winter heating season. Accordingly, the weather can have a material effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

There are certain risks associated with the seasonal nature of our business.

Our working capital needs and borrowings generally peak in our first and third fiscal quarters
because lower sales are generated while expenses are incurred in preparation for the spring and
winter selling seasons. If cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities are ever
insufficient to meet the seasonal needs or if cash flow generated during the spring and winter is
insufficient to repay associated borrowings on a timely basis, this seasonality could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

There is no assurance that our merchandising initiatives and marketing emphasis will provide
expected results.

We believe our past performance has been based on, and future success will depend upon, in part,
the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing. There is no
assurance that we will be successful, or that new initiatives will be executed in a timely manner
to satisfy our customers’ needs or expectations. Failure to execute and promote such initiatives
in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our success depends on
our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and
preferences for merchandise. If we misjudge the market, we may significantly overstock unpopular
products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns. Shortages of key items could also
have a materially adverse impact on operating results.

We face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.

The products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors. All of our
vendors must comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be
certified as meeting required vendor standards of conduct. We rely on foreign manufacturers for
various products that we sell. In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of
their products from foreign sources. We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but
have no long-term contracts with such suppliers. Our future success will depend in large measure
upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones. This
reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local
political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, restrictive
actions by foreign governments, or changes in United States laws and regulations affecting imports
or domestic distribution. Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their
operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which in some cases would make it difficult for us to
serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse affect on our business. As an importer,
our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as
foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, delays in shipments, transportation
capacity and costs, currency exchange rates and changes in political or economic conditions in
countries from which we purchase products. If any such factors were to render the conduct of
business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional United States quotas,
duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in
the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

Our failure to attract and retain qualified employees could adversely affect our financial
performance.

Our ability to continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large
and growing number of qualified employees. Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage
and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a
sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage
rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment
legislation. If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of
labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely
affected.



We may be subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.

Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of
business. We maintain general liability insurance with a $250,000 deductible for each occurrence
and a $29,500,000 aggregate retention
applicable to all general liability and workers compensation claims. We also maintain umbrella
limits above the primary general liability and product liability cover. In many cases, we have
indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability
insurance. Our ability to recover under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject
to the financial viability of the insurers and manufacturers and the specific allegations of a
claim. No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ indemnity will
be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.

Legal proceedings could materially impact our results.

From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and
employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property, and other proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business. Our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and
expenses related to pending or future proceedings.

If we experience difficulties with our management information systems, our financial performance
may be adversely affected.

We depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business. We could be
materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are
unable to improve, upgrade, maintain and expand systems, particularly in light of the contemplated
continued store growth.

Effective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially
impact our results.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than
historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results
in states where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are
subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other state
and local taxing authorities. Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and
expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing
authorities.

Failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could
materially impact our business and results.

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control
over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and
timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the
market price of our common stock.

Legal Proceedings

We are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We
expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations. Any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately
provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable. It is possible,
however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be
materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Overview

Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States
and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those
who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. Our stores are located in
towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and offer the following
comprehensive selection of merchandise:

•

Equine, pet and animal products, including items necessary for their health, care,
growth and containment;

•

Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use;

•

Hardware and tool products;

•

Seasonal products, including lawn and garden power equipment;

•

Truck and towing products; and

•

Work/recreational clothing and footwear for the entire family.

Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,500 square feet to 18,500 square feet of
inside selling space and additional outside selling space. We are developing stores using several
standard prototypes as well as existing building structures.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del’s, which operated 28 stores as of December 27, 2008 primarily in
the Pacific Northwest, offers a wide selection of products (primarily in the equine, pet and animal
category) tailored to those who enjoy the rural lifestyle. Del’s stores currently range in size
from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and
covered/sheltered selling space.

Our current and long-term growth strategy is to (1) expand geographic market presence through
opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases,
achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday low prices” philosophy and
supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through assortment management,
vendor management, sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs, (4)
leverage operating costs, especially occupancy, advertising and distribution, (5) expand market
opportunities via internet sales, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such
opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary
strategy to organic growth.

We have experienced considerable sales growth over the last five years, with a compounded annual
growth rate of approximately 15.4%. We project an increase in our unit count of approximately 8 to
9% for 2009. We believe this unit count increase will contribute substantially to our future
growth. The acquisition of Del’s enabled us to establish an initial presence in the Pacific
Northwest, primarily in Washington, with three additional stores in Hawaii.

We operated 855 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 27, 2008 and have plans to
open 70 to 80 stores in fiscal 2009. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites
and have identified over 575 potential additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores (excluding
Del’s) in the United States. We have slowed the growth of Del’s as we refine the concept, and we
do not plan to open any additional Del’s stores in fiscal 2009.

The net cash investment required to open a new leased retrofit store in fiscal 2008 was between
$0.9 to $2.0 million and $0.9 to $1.3 million to open a new leased prototype store. The average
net cash investment for new stores opened in 2008 was $1.2 million for retrofit stores and $1.0
million for prototype stores. A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of
inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment),
and approximately $107,000 for pre-opening costs.

We have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and
profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures
and modification of the overall product offerings. We believe these efforts, coupled with a strong
marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store employees, have enhanced our
sales and financial performance.



Seasonality and Weather

Our business is highly seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the
second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable
weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales. We
believe, however, that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the
geographic dispersion of our stores.

We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter
each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again
during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season.

Inflation

Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation on our operations, we believe our sales
and results of operations are affected by inflation. We are subject to market risk with respect to
the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain,
petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services. Moreover, in
the last few years, energy prices have risen dramatically, which has resulted in increased fuel
costs for our business and utility costs for our stores. If the cost of these products and
services continues to increase, consumer demand may fall and/or we may not be able to pass all such
increases on to our customers and, as a result, sales and/or gross margins could decline. Our
strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of inflation principally by taking advantage of
vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, increasing retail
prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality. Due
to the competitive environment, such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our gross
margin.

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based
upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements
requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when
reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such
policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts,
adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant
accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The
following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both
important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require
significant judgment or use of complex estimates.



Effect if Actual Results Differ From

Description

Judgments and Uncertainties

Assumptions

Revenue Recognition and
Sales Returns:

We recognize revenue
at the time the
customer takes
possession of
merchandise or
receives services.
If we receive
payment before the
customer has taken
possession of the
merchandise (as per
our special order
and layaway
programs), the
revenue is deferred
until the sale is
complete. Revenues
from the sale of
gift cards are
deferred and
recognized upon
redemption.

We estimate a liability
for sales returns based on
a one-year rolling average
of historical return
trends and we believe that
our estimate for sales
returns is an accurate
reflection of future
returns associated with
past sales. Our
estimation methodologies
have been consistently
applied from year to year,
however, as with any
estimates, refunds
activity may vary from
estimated amounts.

We recognize a benefit for
gift cards when: (i) the
gift card or merchandise
return card is redeemed by
the customer; (ii) the
likelihood of the gift
card being redeemed by the
customer is remote
(referred to as
“breakage”); or (iii) the
unredeemed merchandise
returns cards expire (one
year from issuance). The
gift card breakage rate is
based upon historical
redemption patterns and a
benefit is recognized for
unredeemed gift cards in
proportion to those
historical redemption
patterns.

We have not made
any material
changes in the
accounting
methodology used to
recognize sales
returns in the
financial periods
presented.

We do not believe
there is a
reasonable
likelihood that
there will be a
material change in
the future
estimates or
assumptions we use
to calculate sales
returns or gift
card breakage.
However, if actual
consumer return or
gift card
redemption patterns
are not consistent
with our estimates
or assumptions, we
may be exposed to
losses or gains
that could be
material.

A 10% change in our
sales return
reserve at December
27, 2008, would
have affected net
earnings by
approximately
$195,000 in fiscal
2008.

A 10% change in our
assumptions
regarding gift card
breakage would have
affected net
earnings by
approximately
$315,000 in fiscal
2008.

Inventory Valuation:

Impairment Risk

We identify
potentially excess
and slow-moving
inventory by
evaluating turn
rates, historical
and expected future
sales trends, age of
merchandise, overall
inventory levels,
current cost of
inventory and other
benchmarks. The
estimated inventory
valuation reserve to
recognize any
impairment in value
(i.e., an inability
to realize the full
carrying value) is
based on our
aggregate assessment
of these valuation
indicators under
prevailing market
conditions and
current
merchandising
strategies.

We do not believe our
merchandise inventories
are subject to significant
risk of obsolescence in
the near term. However,
changes in market
conditions or consumer
purchasing patterns could
result in the need for
additional reserves.

Our impairment reserve
contains uncertainties
because the calculation
requires management to
make assumptions and to
apply judgment regarding
forecasted consumer
demand, overall aging, the
promotional environment,
historical results and
current inventory loss
trends.

We have not made
any material
changes in the
accounting
methodology used to
recognize
impairment reserves
in the financial
periods presented.

We do not believe
there is a
reasonable
likelihood that
there will be a
material change in
the future
estimates or
assumptions we use
to calculate
impairment.
However, if
assumptions
regarding consumer
demand or clearance
potential for
certain products
are inaccurate, we
may be exposed to
losses or gains
that could be
material.

A 10% change in our
impairment reserve
at December 27,
2008, would have
affected net
earnings by
approximately
$465,000 in fiscal
2008.



Effect if Actual Results Differ From

Description

Judgments and Uncertainties

Assumptions

Shrinkage

Our stores perform
physical inventories
at least once a year
and we have
established reserves
for estimating
inventory shrinkage
between physical
inventory counts.
This is done by
assessing the
chain-wide average
shrinkage experience
rate, applied to the
related periods’
sales volumes. Such
assessments are
updated on a regular
basis for the most
recent individual
store experiences.

The estimated shrink rate
is based on historical
experience. We believe
historical rates are a
reasonably accurate
reflection of future
trends.

Our shrinkage reserve
contains uncertainties
because the calculation
requires management to
make assumptions and to
apply judgment regarding
historical trends, loss
prevention measures and
new merchandising
strategies.

We have not made
any material
changes in the
methodology used to
recognize shrinkage
in the financial
periods presented.

We do not believe
there is a
reasonable
likelihood that
there will be a
material change in
the future
estimates or
assumptions we use
to calculate our
shrinkage reserve.
However, if our
estimates regarding
inventory losses
are inaccurate, we
may be exposed to
losses or gains
that could be
material.

A 10% change in our
shrinkage reserve
at December 27,
2008, would have
affected net
earnings by
approximately
$878,000 in fiscal
2008.

Vendor Support

We receive funding
from substantially
all of our
significant
merchandise vendors
for the promotion of
our brand as well as
the sale of their
products through a
variety of programs
and arrangements,
including guaranteed
funding and volume
rebate programs.
The amounts received
are subject to terms
of vendor
agreements, which
have varying
expiration dates
ranging in duration
from several months
to several years.
Many agreements are
negotiated annually
and are based on
expected annual
purchases of the
vendor’s product.
Vendor funding is
initially deferred
as a reduction of
the purchase price
of inventory and
then recognized as a
reduction of cost of
merchandise as the
related inventory is
sold, which is in
compliance with
Emerging Issues Task
Force No. 02-16,
“Accounting by a
Customer (Including
a Reseller) for
Certain
Consideration
Received from a
Vendor” (“EITF
02-16”). The amount
of expected funding
is estimated based
upon initial
guaranteed
commitments, as well
as anticipated
purchase levels with
applicable vendors.

The estimated purchase
volume and related vendor
funding is based on our
current knowledge of
inventory levels, sales
trends and expected
customer demand, as well
as planned new store
openings and relocations.
Although we believe we can
reasonably estimate
purchase volume and
related vendor funding, it
is possible that actual
results could
significantly differ from
estimated amounts.

Our allocation methodology
contains uncertainties
because the calculation
requires management to
make assumptions and to
apply judgment regarding
purchasing activity,
target thresholds and
vendor attrition.

At the end of each
fiscal year, the
estimated support
is reconciled to
the actual amounts
earned based upon
actual purchase
activity.

We do not believe
there is a
significant
collectibility risk
related to vendor
support amounts due
us at the end of
fiscal 2008.

Although it is
unlikely that there
will be any
significant
reduction in
historical levels
of vendor support,
if such a reduction
were to occur, the
Company could
experience a higher
inventory balance
and higher cost of
sales.

If a 10% reserve
had been applied
against our
outstanding vendor
support due as of
December 27, 2008,
net earnings would
have been affected
by approximately
$1.2 million.

Freight

We incur various
types of
transportation and
delivery costs in
connection with
inventory purchases.
Such costs are
included as a
component of the
overall cost of
inventories (on an
aggregate basis) and
recognized as a
component of cost of
merchandise sold as
the related
inventory is sold.

We allocate freight as a
component of total cost of
sales without regard to
inventory mix or unique
freight burden of certain
categories. This
assumption has been
consistently applied for
all years presented.

If a 10% increase
or decrease had
been applied
against our current
inventory
capitalized freight
balance, net
earnings would have
been affected by
approximately
$3.1 million.

Share-Based Payments:

We have a
stock-based
compensation plan,
which includes
incentive and
non-qualified stock
options, nonvested
share awards, and an
employee stock
purchase plan. See
Note 1, Significant
Accounting Policies,
and Note 2,
Share-Based
Compensation, to the
Notes to
Consolidated
Financial
Statements, included
in Item 8,
Financial Statements
and Supplementary
Data, of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K,
for a complete
discussion of our
stock-based
compensation
programs.

We estimate the fair
value of our stock
option awards at the
date of grant
utilizing a
Black-Scholes option
pricing model. We
estimate the fair
value of our
market-based
nonvested share
awards at the date
of grant utilizing
average market price
of our stock on the
date of the related
award.

Management reviews
its assumptions and
the valuations
provided by
independent
third-party
valuation advisors
to determine the
fair value of
stock-based
compensation awards.

Option-pricing models and
generally accepted
valuation techniques
require management to make
subjective assumptions and
to apply judgment to
determine the fair value
of our awards. These
assumptions and judgments
include estimating the
future volatility of our
stock price, expected
dividend yield, future
employee turnover rates
and future employee stock
option exercise behaviors.
In addition to the key
assumptions used to
estimate the fair value,
the estimated forfeiture
rate of the awarded
options is a critical
assumption, as it reduces
expense ratably over the
vesting period. Changes
in these assumptions can
materially affect the fair
value estimate.

While we update our
assumptions
annually, we do not
believe there is a
reasonable
likelihood that
there will be a
material change in
the future
estimates or
assumptions we use
to determine
stock-based
compensation
expense. However,
if actual results
are not consistent
with our estimates
or assumptions, we
may be exposed to
changes in
stock-based
compensation
expense that could
be material. The
reported
stock-based
compensation
expense may not be
representative of
the actual economic
cost of the
stock-based
compensation.

A 10% change in our
stock-based
compensation
expense for the
year ended December
27, 2008, would
have affected net
earnings by
approximately
$753,000.

Self-Insurance Reserves:

We self-insure a
significant portion
of our employee
medical insurance,
workers’
compensation and
general liability
insurance plans. We
have stop-loss
insurance policies
to protect from
individual losses
over specified
dollar values
($200,000 for
employee health
insurance claims,
$350,000 for
workers’
compensation and
$250,000 for general
liability).

When estimating our
self-insured
liabilities, we
consider a number of
factors, including
historical claims
experience,
demographic factors,
severity factors and
valuations provided
by independent
third-party
actuaries.

Management reviews
its assumptions and
the valuations
provided by
independent
third-party
actuaries to
determine the
adequacy of our
self-insured
liabilities.

The full extent of certain
claims, especially
workers’ compensation and
general liability claims,
may not become fully
determined for several
years.

Our self-insured
liabilities contain
uncertainties because
management is required to
make assumptions and to
apply judgment to estimate
the ultimate cost to
settle reported claims and
claims incurred but not
reported as of the balance
sheet date.

We have not made
any material
changes in the
accounting
methodology used to
establish our
self-insurance
reserves in the
financial periods
presented.

We do not believe
there is a
reasonable
likelihood that
there will be a
material change in
the assumptions we
use to calculate
insurance reserves.
However, if we
experience a
significant
increase in the
number of claims or
the cost associated
with these claims,
we may be exposed
to losses or gains
that could be
material.

A 10% change in our
self-insurance
reserves at
December 27, 2008,
would have affected
net earnings by
approximately $1.4
million in fiscal
2008.

Sales Tax Audit Reserve:

A portion of our
sales are to
tax-exempt
customers. We
obtain exemption
information as a
necessary part of
each tax-exempt
transaction. Many
of the states in
which we conduct
business will
perform audits to
verify our
compliance with
applicable sales tax
laws. The business
activities of our
customers and the
intended use of the
unique products sold
by us create a
challenging and
complex environment
of compliance.
These circumstances
also create some
risk that we could
be challenged as to
the propriety of our
sales tax
compliance.

While we believe we
reasonably enforce
sales tax compliance
with our customers
and endeavor to
fully comply with
all applicable sales
tax regulations,
there can be no
assurance that we,
upon final
completion of such
audits, would not
have a significant
liability for
disallowed
exemptions.

We review our past audit
experience and assessments
with applicable states to
determine if we have
potential exposure for
non-compliance. Any
estimated liability is
based on an initial
assessment of compliance
risk and our to-date
experience with each
audit. As each audit
progresses, we quantify
the exposure based on
preliminary assessments
made by the state
auditors, adjusted for
additional documentation
that may be provided to
reduce the assessment.

Our sales tax audit
reserve contains
uncertainties because
management is required to
make assumptions and to
apply judgment regarding
the regulatory support for
SKU-specific
agricultural-based
exemptions, ambiguity in
state tax regulations,
and the level of
exemptions support
required by applicable
states.

We have not made
any material
changes in the
methodology used to
establish the sales
tax audit reserve
in the financial
periods presented.

We do not believe
there is a
reasonable
likelihood that
there will be a
material change in
the future
estimates or
assumptions we use
to calculate the
sales tax liability
reserve for current
audits. However,
if our estimates
regarding the
ultimate sales tax
liability are
inaccurate, we may
be exposed to
losses or gains
that could be
material.

A 10% change in our
sales tax liability
reserve at December
27, 2008, would
have affected net
earnings by
approximately
$144,000 in fiscal
2008.

Tax Contingencies:

Our income tax
returns are
periodically audited
by U.S. federal and
state tax
authorities. These
audits include
questions regarding
our tax filing
positions, including
the timing and
amount of deductions
and the allocation
of income among
various tax
jurisdictions. At
any one time,
multiple tax years
are subject to audit
by the various tax
authorities. In
evaluating the
exposures associated
with our various tax
filing positions, we
record reserves for
probable exposures.
A number of years
may elapse before a
particular matter,
for which we have
established a
reserve, is audited
and fully resolved
or clarified. We
adjust our tax
contingencies
reserve and income
tax provision in the
period in which
actual results of a
settlement with tax
authorities differs
from our established
reserve, the statute
of limitations
expires for the
relevant tax
authority to examine
the tax position or
when more
information becomes
available.

Effective December
31, 2006, we adopted
Financial Accounting
Standards Board
(“FASB”)
Interpretation
No. 48,

Accounting
for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, an
Interpretation of
FASB Statement
No. 109

(“FIN 48”)

.

Accordingly, we
recognize a
liability for
certain tax benefits
that do not meet the
minimum requirements
for recognition in
the financial
statements. See
Note 9,
Income
Taxes, to
Consolidated
Financial
Statements, included
in Item 8, Financial
Statements and
Supplementary Data,
of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K
for a complete
discussion on our
unrecognized tax
benefit reserve.

Our tax contingencies
reserve contains
uncertainties because
management is required to
make assumptions and to
apply judgment to estimate
the exposures associated
with our various filing
positions and whether or
not the minimum
requirements for
recognition of tax
benefits have been met.

Our effective income tax
rate is also affected by
changes in tax law, the
tax jurisdiction of new
stores or business
ventures, the level of
earnings and the results
of tax audits.

We do not believe
there is a
reasonable
likelihood that
there will be a
material change in
the reserves
established for tax
benefits not
recognized.

Although management
believes that the
judgments and
estimates discussed
herein are
reasonable, actual
results could
differ, and we may
be exposed to
losses or gains
that could be
material.

To the extent we
prevail in matters
for which reserves
have been
established, or are
required to pay
amounts in excess
of our reserves,
our effective
income tax rate in
a given financial
statement period
could be materially
affected. An
unfavorable tax
settlement would
require use of our
cash and would
result in an
increase in our
effective income
tax rate in the
period of
resolution. A
favorable tax
settlement would be
recognized as a
reduction in our
effective income
tax rate in the
period of
resolution.

A 10% change in our
unrecognized tax
benefit reserve at
December 27, 2008
would have affected
net earnings by
approximately
$187,000 in fiscal
2008.

Goodwill:

Goodwill and
intangible assets
with indefinite
lives are not
amortized. We
evaluate goodwill
for impairment
annually and
whenever events or
changes in
circumstances
indicate the
carrying value of
the goodwill may not
be recoverable. We
complete our
impairment
evaluation by
performing internal
valuation analyses,
considering other
publicly available
market information
and using an
independent
valuation firm, as
appropriate. All
goodwill at
December 27, 2008
and December 29,
2007 is associated
with the Del’s
business and for
purposes of
impairment testing,
Del’s is considered
the reporting unit.

The test for
goodwill impairment
is a two step
process. The first
step of the goodwill
impairment test,
used to identify the
potential for
impairment, compares
the fair value of a
reporting unit with
the carrying value
of its net assets,
including goodwill.
If the fair value of
the reporting unit
is less than the
carrying value of
the reporting unit,
the second step of
the goodwill
impairment test is
performed to measure
the amount of
impairment loss to
be recorded, if any.
The second step, if
required, would
compare the implied
fair value of
goodwill with the
current carrying
amount of goodwill.
If the implied fair
value of goodwill is
less than the
carrying value, an
impairment charge
would be recorded as
a charge to our
operations.

In the fourth
quarter of fiscal
2008, we completed
our annual
impairment testing
of goodwill using
the methodology
described herein,
and determined there
was no impairment.
We performed the
first step of the
goodwill impairment
analysis with the
assistance of a
third party
valuation specialist
and determined that
the fair value of
the Del’s reporting
unit (including
goodwill) was in
excess of the
carrying value of
the reporting unit
and as such, the
second step was not
necessary. In
reaching this
conclusion, the fair
value of the Del’s
reporting unit was
determined based on
a weighting of
income and market
approaches. Under
the income approach,
the fair value of
the Del’s reporting
unit is calculated
as the present value
of estimated future
cash flows. Under
the market approach,
the fair value is
based on observed
market multiples for
comparable
businesses and
guideline
transactions.

We determine fair value
using widely accepted
valuation techniques,
including discounted cash
flow and market multiple
analyses. These types of
analyses contain
uncertainties because they
require management to make
assumptions and to apply
judgment to estimate
industry economic factors
and the profitability of
future business
strategies. Estimates
include revenues, gross
margins, operating costs
and cash flows. We
considered historical and
estimated future results,
economic and market
conditions and the impact
of planned business and
operational strategies in
deriving these estimates.

We have not made
any material
changes in our
impairment loss
assessment
methodology in the
financial periods
presented.

In developing the
key judgments and
assumptions used to
assess impairment,
we consider
economic,
operational and
market conditions
that could impact
the fair value of
the Del’s reporting
unit. These
estimates and the
judgments and
assumptions upon
which the estimates
are based may
differ in some
respects from
actual results.
Should a
significant or
prolonged
deterioration in
economic conditions
persist, then key
judgments and
assumptions may be
impacted. Thus, if
actual results are
not consistent with
our current
estimates or
assumptions, we may
be exposed to an
impairment charge
that could be
material.

Long-Lived Assets:

Long-lived assets
other than goodwill
and indefinite-lived
intangible assets,
which are separately
tested for
impairment, are
evaluated for
impairment whenever
events or changes in
circumstances
indicate that the
carrying value may
not be recoverable.

When evaluating
long-lived assets
for potential
impairment, we first
compare the carrying
value of the asset
to the asset’s
estimated future
cash flows
(undiscounted and
without interest
charges). If the
estimated future
cash flows are less
than the carrying
value of the asset,
we calculate an
impairment loss. The
impairment loss
calculation compares
the carrying value
of the asset to the
asset’s estimated
fair value, which
may be based on an
estimated future
cash flow model. We
recognize an
impairment loss if
the amount of the
asset’s carrying
value exceeds the
asset’s estimated
fair value. If we
recognize an
impairment loss, the
adjusted carrying
amount of the asset
becomes its new cost
basis. For a
depreciable
long-lived asset,
the new cost basis
will be depreciated
(amortized) over the
remaining useful
life of that asset.

Our impairment loss
calculations contain
uncertainties because they
require management to make
assumptions and to apply
judgment to estimate
future cash flows and
asset fair values,
including forecasting
useful lives of the assets
and selecting the discount
rate that reflects the
risk inherent in future
cash flows.

We have not made
any material
changes in our
impairment loss
assessment
methodology in the
financial periods
presented.

We do not believe
there is a
reasonable
likelihood that
there will be a
material change in
the estimates or
assumptions we use
to calculate
long-lived asset
impairment losses.
However, if actual
results are not
consistent with our
estimates and
assumptions used in
estimating future
cash flows and
asset fair values,
we may be exposed
to losses that
could be material.

Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007

Net sales increased 11.3% to $3,007.9 million in fiscal 2008 from $2,703.2 million in fiscal 2007.
This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of
1.4%. Our average transaction value increased 2.2% to $44.55 and same-store transaction value
increased 1.3% for fiscal 2008. The same-store average daily transaction count increased 0.1%.
The average daily transaction count for the Company decreased 3.8% to 230. The decrease is a
result of the new stores opened during the year which have lower transaction volumes until their
sales ramp to chain average.

Same-store sales improvements of 1.4% compared to 3.4% in the prior year were strongest in core
consumable categories including animal and pet-related products, clothing and footwear.

In fiscal 2008, we opened 91 new stores (compared to 89 new stores in fiscal 2007), relocated one
store (compared to 12 in fiscal 2007) and closed no stores (compared to selling our only Del’s
store located in Canada in fiscal 2007).

Gross margin increased 7.0% to $912.3 million compared to $852.7 million in 2007. As a percent of
sales, gross margin decreased to 30.3% for fiscal 2008 compared to 31.5% for fiscal 2007. The
decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from a substantial increase in the LIFO provision. The
LIFO provision increased 123 basis points from the prior year due to significant inflation
(increases in costs for certain commodities, petroleum-based products and steel), a shift in the
product mix towards higher turning, higher inflationary items and clearance activity.

As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 10 basis
points to 23.8% in fiscal 2008 from 23.7% in fiscal 2007. This increase was due largely to
occupancy and payroll expenses relating to new stores, which generally have higher costs in
relation to sales volume than the chain average, offset by an aggressive expense management
program. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 18.9% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 due
mainly to costs associated with new stores.

Net interest expense decreased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to $2.1 million in fiscal 2008
from $5.0 million in fiscal 2007. This decrease is directly related to a lower average debt
balance primarily due to a reduction in stock repurchase activity in 2008, as compared to 2007.

Our effective tax rate increased to 38.6% for fiscal 2008 compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2007,
resulting primarily from increases in state tax rates.

As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2008 decreased 14.9% to $81.9 million,
or $2.19 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $96.2 million, or $2.40 per diluted share,
in fiscal 2007. During 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of stock for $53.9
million as part of our previously announced $400
million share repurchase program. In 2007, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a
total cost of $150.0 million.



Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

Net sales increased 14.1% to $2,703.2 million in fiscal 2007 from $2,369.6 million in fiscal 2006.
This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of
3.4%. Our average transaction value increased 1.1% to $43.60 while same-store transaction value
decreased 0.1% for fiscal 2007. Average daily transaction count per store increased 0.6% to 239,
and same-store transaction count increased 3.5%.

Same-store sales improvements of 3.4% compared to 1.6% in the prior year were strongest in the
livestock/pet and truck/towing categories, but were partially offset by lower than expected
performance in seasonal and hardware/tool products.

In fiscal 2007, we opened 89 new stores (compared to 82 new stores in fiscal 2006), relocated 12
stores (compared to 15 in fiscal 2006) and sold our only Del’s store located in Canada (compared to
one closed store in fiscal 2006).

As a percent of sales, gross margin was unchanged at 31.5% compared with the prior year.
Reductions in direct product costs were achieved through improved sourcing and mix of sales, but
were offset by slightly higher transportation costs and increased shrinkage.

As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 20 basis points to 23.7% in fiscal 2007 from 23.5%
in fiscal 2006. The increase is primarily attributable to increased occupancy and payroll costs
from new stores, which generally have higher costs in relation to sales volume than the chain
average. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 20.7% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 due
mainly to costs associated with new stores.

Net interest expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales to $5.0 million in fiscal 2007
from $2.7 million in fiscal 2006. This increase is due largely to borrowings related to the stock
repurchase program.

Our effective tax rate increased to 37.9% for fiscal 2007 compared to 37.4% in fiscal 2006,
resulting primarily from state taxes relating to the composition of income among the states and the
adoption of FIN 48 relating to uncertainties in income tax positions. This interpretation
prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions that meet a “more-likely-than-not”
recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized.
We are no longer subject to federal examination for years before 2005, and state and local income
tax examinations for years before 2002.

We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 in fiscal 2007, as required. As a result, we charged
approximately $1.9 million to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of adoption including
interest. Interest and penalties were immaterial at the date of adoption. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $2.3 million.
In addition, we recognize current interest accrued related to these uncertain tax positions as
interest expense.

As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2007 increased 5.8% to $96.2 million,
or $2.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $91.0 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, in
fiscal 2006. During 2007, the Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of its stock for $150.0
million as part of our previously announced $400 million (as amended in August 2008) share
repurchase program.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion,
remodeling and relocation programs, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures. Our
primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations, commitments available
under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. Our
inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in
anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons, respectively.



Working Capital

At December 27, 2008, we had working capital of $283.5 million, a $28.6 million decrease from
December 29, 2007. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in the following components
of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):

The decrease in inventories resulted primarily from a decrease in average inventory per store due
to planned inventory management initiatives to reduce inventory levels coupled with more aggressive
clearance efforts. The accounts payable increase is due to improved vendor financing. Trade
credit arises from our vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases. Payment
terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product. We experienced an
increase in our financed inventory from approximately 38.3% in 2007 to 43.0% in 2008. (The
calculated financed inventory assumes average inventory, excludes in-transit inventories and
includes only unopened stores with significant inventory).

Borrowings and Credit Facilities

On February 22, 2007 we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A, as
agent for a lender group (the “Credit Agreement”), allowing us to borrow up to $250 million (with
sublimits of $75 million and $10 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively).
The Credit Agreement is unsecured and has a five year term, with proceeds expected to be used for
working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases.

In February 2008, we exercised the increase option on our Credit Agreement increasing the overall
capacity from $250 million to $350 million. Each of the nine lenders within our Credit Agreement
bank group participated in the increase. Simultaneously, definitions within the Credit Agreement
were modified as follows: (1) added an additional Increase Option for $150 million (subject to
additional lender group commitments); (2) modified the definition of swingline committed amount
from $10 million to $20 million; and (3) revised the definition of the fixed charge coverage ratio
covenant to remove certain defined fixed charges. All pricing terms and the term of the facility
remained the same.

At December 27, 2008, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and there
were $55.0 million in borrowings outstanding at December 29, 2007. There were an additional $25.1
million and $25.0 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 27, 2008 and December 29,
2007, respectively. Borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate (3.25% at December 27,
2008) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) (0.46% at December 27, 2008) plus an additional
amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.50% at
December 27, 2008). We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging
from 0.06% to 0.18% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, for unused capacity
(0.10% at December 27, 2008). There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the
Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital
expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of
assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. The Credit Agreement requires
quarterly compliance with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios. We were in
compliance with all covenants at December 27, 2008.



Sources and Uses of Cash

Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for
investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt and
repurchase of the Company’s common stock. The following table presents a summary of cash flows
from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):

The improvement in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was
primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments. Inventory levels
decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, due to an increased focus on inventory management in 2008.
Additionally, we achieved an increase in financed inventory to 43.0% in 2008 from 38.3% in 2007,
resulting in an increase in accounts payable while decreasing inventory.

The $67.5 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 is
primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):

The improvement in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was
primarily due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments. Inventory levels
increased less in 2007 compared to 2006, due to the timing of imports and a focus on inventory
management in 2007. Additionally, we achieved a slight increase in financed inventory, resulting
in a higher increase in accounts payable relative to inventory. The change in cash used for income
taxes relates to the timing of quarterly payments caused by annualized proration requirements.



Investing Activities

Investing activities used $88.4 million, $82.6 million and $80.8 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures.

Our significant store expansion, coupled with required investment in infrastructure, resulted in
the following capital expenditures, including capital leases (in millions):

Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further
concentration within existing markets. This growth will also require continuing investment in
information technology and people. The costs reflected above are typically building improvements,
as we lease the majority of our facilities. We currently estimate that capital expenditures will
range between $95 million and $100 million in fiscal 2009. While we plan to open fewer stores in
2009, we expect to replace those investments with store refurbishment, an upgrade in IT hardware,
and other efficiency-driving system enhancements in 2009.

Financing Activities

Financing activities used $105.5 million, used $85.1 million, and provided $10.1 million in fiscal
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2008 is mainly
the result of share repurchase activity and net repayments under the Senior Credit Facility.

We have a Board-approved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to $400
million of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such
repurchases, through December 2011. In August 2008, the board of directors authorized a $200
million increase to the existing $200 million share repurchase program and extended the program
term from February 2010 to December 2011. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares
repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and
regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares
will be held in treasury. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior
notice. As of December 27, 2008, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program
of $196.2 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.

We repurchased approximately 1.6 million and 3.2 million shares at a total cost of $53.9 million
and $150.0 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Repurchased shares are accounted for at
cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.

We believe that our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under the Credit Agreement, and
normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs,
including store openings, relocations and renovations, over the next several years.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.
The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. We typically lease buildings for retail
stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital
to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets. Letters of credit allow us to purchase
inventory, primarily sourced overseas, and support certain risk management programs in a timely
manner.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”, (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, “Effective Date
of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP 157-2”), which amended SFAS 157 and delayed its effective date for
all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually).
FSP 157-2 defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008,
and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of FSP 157-2. The
adoption of SFAS 157 and FSP 157-2 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations,
or cash flow.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a
Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. This FSP clarifies the application
of Statement No. 157 in an inactive market. The FASB also issued a joint press release with the
Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC on September 30, 2008 that addresses similar guidance to
what is contained in FSP FAS 157-3. The guidance in these two releases clarifies that observable
transactions in inactive markets may not be indicative of fair value, and in such instances, the
use of a reporting entity’s own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted
discount rates may provide a better estimate of an asset’s fair value. The application of this
guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible
financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates. Such election, which may be applied on
an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected. We adopted SFAS 159
effective December 30, 2007 (fiscal 2008). The adoption of SFAS 159 did not impact our financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flow.

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (“SFAS 141R”),
which replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (“SFAS 141”) issued in 2001

.

Whereas its
predecessor applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring
consideration, the revised standard applies to all transactions or other events in which one entity
obtains control over another. SFAS 141R defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control
over one or more other businesses and defines the acquisition date as the date the acquirer
achieves control. SFAS 141R requires the acquirer to recognize assets acquired, liabilities assumed
and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their respective fair values as of the
acquisition date. The revised standard changes the treatment of acquisition-related costs,
restructuring costs related to an acquisition that the acquirer expects but is not obligated to
incur, contingent consideration associated with the purchase price and preacquisition contingencies
associated with acquired assets and liabilities. SFAS 141R retains the guidance in SFAS 141 for
identifying and recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill. The revised standard applies
prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning
of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Thus we will be
required to apply the provisions of SFAS 141R to any business acquisition which occurs on or after
December 28, 2008, but this standard will have no effect on prior acquisitions.



Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets”, which amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension
assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized
intangible asset under SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” The FSP requires an entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of
the term of the arrangement, consistent with its expected use of the asset, and is an attempt to
improve consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the
period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141, “Business
Combinations.” The FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and the
guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied
prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The FSP is not expected to
have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles” (“SFAS 162”). The statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying
a consistent hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial
statements that are prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles.
SFAS 162 was effective November 15, 2008 and did not have any impact on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flow.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Credit Agreement. The Credit
Agreement bears interest at either the bank’s base rate (3.25% and 7.25% at December 27, 2008 and
December 29, 2007, respectively) or LIBOR (0.46% and 4.86% at December 27, 2008 and December 29,
2007, respectively) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted
quarterly, based on our performance (0.50% at both December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007). We
are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% based
on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.10% at both December 27, 2008 and
December 29, 2007). A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move (increase) in interest rates along
the entire interest rate yield curve would result in approximately $535,000 of additional annual
interest expense and would not impact the fair market value of the long-term debt.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Tractor Supply Company

We have audited Tractor Supply Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
27, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Tractor
Supply Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 27, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December 27,
2008 and December 29, 2007 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 27, 2008 and our report
dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Tractor Supply Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of
December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 27,
2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply Company at December 27, 2008 and
December 29, 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 27, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2007 the Company changed its
method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Tractor Supply Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 27, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February
24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies:

Nature of Business

Tractor Supply Company (the “Company”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) is the largest operator of retail
farm and ranch stores in the United States. We are focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of
recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and
small businesses. Stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural
communities. At December 27, 2008, we operated 855 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states and
also offered a number of products online at

TractorSupply.com

.

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year and includes 52 or 53 weeks. The
fiscal years ended December 27, 2008, December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 consist of 52 weeks.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Segment Information

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, “Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” Tractor Supply Company has one reportable
industry segment — the operation of farm and ranch retail stores and also offers a number of
products online at

TractorSupply.com

.

Management Estimates

Our preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States inherently requires estimates and assumptions by us that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related
disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial
statement areas:

Revenue Recognition and Sales Returns

We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives
services. If we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise
(as per our layaway program), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete.

We are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government
agencies and remit these back to the applicable governmental entity on a periodic basis.
These taxes are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in
net sales. We record a liability upon collection from the customer and relieve the
liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency.

We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a one-year rolling average of historical
return trends, and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection
of future returns associated with past sales. Our estimation methodologies have been
consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimate, refund activity may
vary from estimated amounts. At December 27, 2008 we had a liability of $3.2 million
reserved for sales returns, compared to $3.0 million at December 29, 2007.

We recognize a benefit for gift cards when: (i) the gift card or merchandise return card is
redeemed by the customer; (ii) the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the
customer is remote (referred to as “breakage”); or (iii) the unredeemed merchandise returns
cards expire (one year from issuance). The gift card breakage rate is based upon historical
redemption patterns and a benefit is recognized for unredeemed gift cards in proportion to
those historical redemption patterns. We recognized a benefit of $1.4 million, $1.2 million
and $2.4 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Inventory Valuation

Impairment Risk

We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates,
historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels,
current cost of inventory and other benchmarks. The estimated inventory valuation reserve
to recognize any impairment in value (i.e. an inability to realize the full carrying value)
is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market
conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise
inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However,
changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for
additional reserves.

Shrinkage

We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year and we have established
reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts. The reserve
is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the
related periods’ sales volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the
most recent individual store experiences. The estimated shrink rate is based on historical
experience. We believe historical rates are an accurate reflection of future trends.

Vendor Support

We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the
promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs
and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs. The amounts
received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates
ranging in duration from several months to several years. Many agreements are negotiated
annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor’s product. Vendor funding
is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized
as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold, which is in
compliance with

EITF 02-16.

The amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as
well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume
and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales
trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.
Although we believe we have the ability to reasonably estimate purchase volume and related
vendor funding, it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the
estimated amounts.

Freight

We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory
purchases and distribution. Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of
inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise
sold as the related inventory is sold.

Share-Based Payments

We have share-based compensation plans covering certain members of management and non-employee
directors. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payments” (“SFAS 123(R)”) using the modified prospective
transition method. (See Note 2).

We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified

Black-Scholes

option pricing model. The

Black-Scholes

option valuation model was developed for
use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. However, key assumptions used in the

Black-Scholes

model are
adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards. Option valuation
models require the input of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility,
risk- free interest rate and expected life. We rely on historical volatility trends to estimate
future volatility assumptions. The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S. Treasury
Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant.
The expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on our historical
experience for similar options.

In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture
rate at the time of valuation (which is based on historical experience for similar options) is a
critical assumption, as it reduces expense
ratably over the vesting period. We adjust this estimate annually, based on the extent to which
actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We believe our estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience. The impact of
adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of
share-based payments granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option
exercises.

Sales Tax Audit Reserve

A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. We obtain exemption information as a
necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction. Many of the states in which we conduct business
will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business
activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a
challenging and complex compliance environment. These circumstances also create some risk that
we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance. While we believe we
reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all
applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of
such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions.

We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we
have potential exposure for non-compliance. Any estimated liability is based on an initial
assessment of compliance risk and our to-date experience with each audit. As each audit
progresses, we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state
auditors, adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.
The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the
complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of
ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.

Self-Insurance Reserves

We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers’ compensation
and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from
individual losses over specified dollar values ($200,000 for employee health insurance claims,
$350,000 for workers’ compensation and $250,000 for general liability). The full extent of
certain claims, especially workers’ compensation and general liability claims, may not become
fully determined for several years. Therefore, we estimate potential obligations for liabilities
that have been incurred but not yet reported based upon use of outside actuarial consultants,
historical data, and experience. Although we believe the reserves established for these
obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant increase in the number of claims or costs
associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our
financial results. At December 27, 2008, we had recorded net insurance reserves of $22.6
million, compared to $21.7 million at December 29, 2007.

Tax Contingencies

Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These
audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of
deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple
tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures
associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures. A
number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve,
is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income
tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs
from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority
to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.

In accordance with FIN 48, we recognize a liability for certain tax benefits that do not meet
the minimum requirements for recognition in the financial statements

Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make
assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing
positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been
met.

Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of
new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Credit Cards/Accounts Receivable

Sales generated through our private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.
Under an agreement with Citi Commerce Solutions, a division of Citigroup (“Citigroup”), consumer
and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup. All credit program and related
services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup.

Pre-opening Costs

Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new store and distribution centers,
primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred. Preopening costs were approximately $8.7
million, $9.4 million and $9.4 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Store Closing Costs

We regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are
under-performing. We recognize store closing costs in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” which requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability
is incurred, usually in the period the store closes. Store closing costs were not significant to
results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered
to be cash equivalents. The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit card
transactions process within 24-48 hours and are accordingly classified as cash and cash
equivalents.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables and payables
and long-term debt instruments, including capital leases. The carrying values of cash and cash
equivalents, receivables and trade payables equal current fair value. The terms of our Credit
Agreement include variable interest rates, which approximate current market rates.

Inventories

Inventories are stated using the lower of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market. Inventories are
not in excess of market value. Quarterly inventory determinations under LIFO are based on
assumptions as to projected inventory levels at the end of the fiscal year, sales for the year and
the rate of inflation/deflation for the year. If the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of
accounting for inventory had been used, inventories would have been approximately $68.3 million and
$25.5 million higher than reported at December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007, respectively.

Vendor Concentration

Approximately 250 vendors accounted for 90% of our purchases for fiscal 2008, with no one vendor
representing more than 10% of purchases during the year.

Warehousing and Distribution Costs

Costs incurred at our distribution centers for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for
delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses
in the Consolidated Statements of Income.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Improvements to leased premises are
amortized using the straight-line method over the initial term of the lease or the useful life of
the improvement, whichever is less. Leasehold improvements added late in the
lease term are amortized over the term of the lease (including the first renewal option, if the
renewal is reasonably assured) or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less. The
following estimated useful lives are generally applied:

Life

Buildings

30 – 35 years

Leasehold and building improvements

5 – 15 years

Furniture, fixtures and equipment

5 – 10 years

Computer software and hardware

3 – 5 years

Capitalized Software Costs

The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and
amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
software, which is three to five years. These costs are included in Computer software and hardware
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain software costs not meeting the criteria
for capitalization are expensed as incurred.

Leases

Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with our normal depreciation policy for
owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included
in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Certain leases include rent increases during the initial lease term. For these leases, we
recognize the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease (which
includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement)
and record the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a rent
liability.

We occasionally receive reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related
store to be leased. Reimbursements are primarily for the purpose of performing work required to
divide a much larger location into smaller segments, one of which we will use for our store. This
work could include the addition of demising walls, separation of plumbing, utilities, electric
work, entrances (front and back) and other work as required. Leasehold improvements are recorded
at their gross costs including items reimbursed by landlords. Related reimbursements are amortized
on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the initial lease term.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately
tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”.

When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of
the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges).
If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an
impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the
asset’s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. We
recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s
estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset
becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be
depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset.

No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Goodwill

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. We evaluate goodwill for
impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of
the goodwill may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other
publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate. All
goodwill at December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007 is associated with the Del’s business and, for
purposes of impairment testing, Del’s is considered the reporting unit.

The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment
test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit
with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting
unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill
impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. The
second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current
carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying
value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to our operations.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we performed the first step of the goodwill impairment
analysis with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist and determined that the fair
value of the Del’s reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the
reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary. In reaching this conclusion, the
fair value of the Del’s reporting unit was determined based on a weighting of income and market
approaches. Under the income approach, the fair value of the Del’s reporting unit is calculated as
the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is
based on observed market multiples for comparable businesses and guideline transactions. Both of
these approaches involve the use of significant estimates as to revenues, gross margin, operating
costs and cash flows. We considered historical and estimated future results, economic and market
conditions and the impact of planned business and operational strategies in deriving these
estimates.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars, television
and radio, as well as direct mail, newspaper advertisements and other promotions. Costs are
expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail
promotions, which are expensed upon first showing. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006 were approximately $58.0 million, $58.6 million and $53.2 million, respectively. Prepaid
advertising costs were approximately $0.4 million and $1.3 million at December 27, 2008 and
December 29, 2007, respectively.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Net Income Per Share

As provided by SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share”, basic earnings per share is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares
outstanding. Diluted shares are computed using the treasury stock method for options.

Foreign Currency Translation

Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S.
dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated
other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity. The assets and liabilities of our store in
British Columbia, which was sold in fiscal 2007, were translated into United States dollars at
year-end rates of exchange, while revenues and expense items were translated at average rates for
the period.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 2 — Share-Based Compensation:

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123(R), using the modified prospective method and began
recognizing compensation expense for share-based payments based on the fair value of the awards.
Share-based payments include
stock option grants and certain transactions under our other stock plans. SFAS 123(R) requires
share-based compensation expense to be recognized based on the following: a) grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), for unvested options granted prior to the adoption date; b) grant date
fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based payments
granted subsequent to the adoption date; and c) the discount on shares sold to employees subsequent
to the adoption date, which represents the difference between the grant date fair value and the
employee purchase price.

Share-based compensation expense lowered pre-tax income by $12.3 million, $10.6 million (including
a reduction in expense of approximately $0.5 million related to the modification of certain board
members and officers upon resignation) and $9.7 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Under SFAS 123(R), forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably
over the vesting period. This estimate is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual
forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate. Under SFAS 123, we
elected to account for forfeitures at the time of valuation and reduce the pro-forma expense
ratably over the period.

Effective May 4, 2006, we adopted the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, which replaced the 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan. Following the adoption of the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, no further grants may be
made under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan.

Under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to officers, non-employee directors and
other employees. The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years
from the date of grant. In the case of a stockholder owning more than 10% of the outstanding
voting stock of the Company, the exercise price of an incentive stock option may not be less than
110% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no
later than five years from the date of grant. Also, the aggregate fair market value of the stock
with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable on a tax deferred basis for the first
time by an individual in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. Vesting of options commences
at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant.

Under the terms of the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, a maximum of 2,750,000 shares are available for
grant as stock options or other awards. At December 27, 2008, we had 1,436,023 shares available
for future equity awards under the Company’s 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.

The fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each vesting date. The fair value
of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. We have
estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a
modified

Black-Scholes

pricing valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves
assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.
The weighted averages for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted
during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each
assumption, are as follows:

Expected Price Volatility —

This is a measure of the amount by which a price has
fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. We use actual historical changes in the
market value of the stock to calculate expected price volatility because we believe
that this is the best indicator of future volatility. Prior to July 2006, we
calculated weekly market value changes from the date of grant over a past period
representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.
Beginning in July 2006, we calculated daily market value changes from the date of
grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the
options to determine volatility. An increase in the expected volatility will
increase compensation expense.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Risk-Free Interest Rate —

This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a
term equal to the expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest
rate will increase compensation expense.

Weighted Average Expected Lives —

This is the period of time over which the options
granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience.
Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years. An increase in the
expected life will increase compensation expense.

Forfeiture Rate —

This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are
expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully vested. This estimate is
based on historical experience. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease
compensation expense.

Dividend Yield —

We have not made any dividend payments nor do we plan to pay
dividends in the foreseeable future. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease
compensation expense.

According to the terms of the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, in the case of a stockholder owning more than 10% of the
outstanding voting stock, the exercise price of an incentive stock option may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the
stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than five years from the date of grant.

During 2007, certain options were modified to immediately vest and extend the related exercise
period, effectively resulting in a cancellation of existing options and grant of new options (there
were no modifications in 2008). The options retained the original exercise price and, as a result,
the modified options had exercise prices both above and below the modification date fair market
value. The following summarizes the activity related to these modifications:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) whereby all our employees have the opportunity
to purchase, through payroll deductions, shares of common stock at a 15% discount. Pursuant to the
terms of the ESPP, we issued 61,348, 46,654 and 38,354 shares of common stock during fiscal 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. The total cost related to the ESPP, including the compensation
expense calculation under SFAS 123(R), was approximately $485,000, $556,000 and $430,000 in fiscal
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 27, 2008, there were 3,238,055 shares of common
stock reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.

There were no significant modifications to the Company’s share-based compensation plans during
fiscal 2008.

Note 3 — Credit Agreement:

On February 22, 2007 we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A, as
agent for a lender group (the “Credit Agreement”), allowing us to borrow up to $250 million (with
sublimits of $75 million and $10 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively).
The Credit Agreement is unsecured and has a five year term, with proceeds expected to be used for
working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases.

In February 2008, we exercised the Increase Option on our Credit Agreement increasing the overall
capacity from $250 million to $350 million. Each of the nine lenders within our bank group
participated in the increase. Simultaneously, definitions within the Credit Agreement were
modified as follows: (1) added an additional Increase Option for $150 million (subject to
additional lender group commitments); (2) modified the definition of swingline committed amount
from $10 million to $20 million; and (3) revised the definition of the fixed charge coverage ratio
covenant to remove certain defined fixed charges. All pricing terms and the term of the Credit
Agreement remained the same.

At December 27, 2008, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement and $55
million in borrowings outstanding at December 29, 2007. There were an additional $25.1 million and
$25.0 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007,
respectively. Borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate (3.25% at December 27, 2008)
or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (0.46% at December 27, 2008) plus an additional amount ranging
from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.50% at December 27,
2008). We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to
0.18% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, for unused capacity (0.10% at
December 27, 2008). There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Credit
Agreement.

The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital
expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of
assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. The Credit Agreement requires
quarterly compliance with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios. We were in
compliance with all covenants at December 27, 2008.

Note 4 — Leases:

We lease the majority of our office space and retail store locations, certain distribution centers,
transportation equipment and other equipment under various noncancellable operating leases. The
leases have varying terms and expire at various dates through 2029 and 2025 for capital leases and
operating leases, respectively. Store leases typically have initial terms of between 10 and 15
years, with two to four optional renewal periods of five years each. Some leases require the
payment of contingent rent that is based upon store sales above agreed-upon sales levels for the
year. The sales levels vary for each store and are established in the lease agreements.
Generally, most of the leases also require that we pay associated taxes, insurance and maintenance
costs.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Total rent expense for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $133.3 million, $124.0 million
and $104.3 million respectively. Total contingent rent expense for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
insignificant.

Note 5 — Capital Stock:

The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of common stock and preferred stock. The
Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock. The Company is also authorized
to issue 40,000 shares of Preferred Stock, with such designations, rights and preferences as may be
determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.

Note 6 — Treasury Stock:

We have a Board-approved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to $400
million of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such
repurchases, through December 2011. In August 2008, the board of directors authorized a $200
million increase to the existing $200 million share repurchase program and extended the program
term from February 2010 to December 2011. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares
repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and
regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares
will be held in treasury. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior
notice.

We repurchased 1,598,114 and 3,216,187 shares under the share repurchase program during 2008 and
2007, respectively. The total cost of the share repurchases was $53.9 million and $150.0 million
during 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December 27, 2008, we had remaining authorization under
the share repurchase program of $196.2 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other
expenses.

The Company and its affiliates file income tax returns in the U. S. and various state and local
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state and local income
tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2002. Various states have completed an
examination of our income tax returns for 2001 through 2006. Our reserve was reduced due to audit
settlements. These adjustments were not material to our results of operations.

We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on December 31, 2006. As a result of the implementation of FIN
48, we recognized a $1.9 million increase (net of applicable federal tax benefit) in the liability
for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, which was accounted for as a reduction to the
December 30, 2006 balance of retained earnings. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits
that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate, is $2.0 million. In addition, we will
recognize current interest and penalties accrued related to these uncertain tax positions as
interest expense, (a component of total operating expenses) and the amount is not material to the
Consolidated Statements of Income. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of

Note 10 — Retirement Benefit Plans:

We have a defined contribution benefit plan, the Tractor Supply Company 401(k) Retirement Savings
Plan (the “Plan”), which provides retirement and other benefits for our employees. Employees
become eligible at the first quarterly entry period following their fulfillment of the eligibility
requirements. To be eligible, an employee must be at least 21 years of age, have completed 12
months of employment, and performed 1,000 hours of service in a year of service as defined by the
Plan. We match (in cash) 100% of the employee’s elective contributions up to 3% of the employee’s
eligible compensation plus 50% of the employee’s elective contributions from 3% to 6% of the
employee’s eligible compensation. In no event shall the total Company match made on behalf of the
employee exceed 4.5% of the employee’s eligible compensation. All current contributions are
immediately 100% vested. Company contributions to the Plan during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, were
approximately $2,750,000, $2,595,000 and $2,278,000, respectively.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We offer, through a deferred compensation program, the opportunity for certain qualifying employees
to elect a deferral of up to 40% of their annual base salary and up to 100% of their annual
incentive bonus under their respective incentive bonus programs. To be eligible for the salary
deferral, each participant must contribute the maximum amount of salary to the Tractor Supply
Company 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan subject to the Company’s match. Under the deferred
compensation program, the participants’ salary deferral is matched by the Company, 100% on the
first $3,000 of base salary contributed and 50% on the next $3,000 of base salary contributed
limited to a maximum annual matching contribution of $4,500. Each participant’s account earns
simple annual interest at the prime rate as in effect on January 1 each year. Each participant is
fully vested in all amounts credited to their deferred compensation account. Payments under the
program, which are made in cash and paid in ten annual installments or in a single lump sum payment
at the election of the participant, are made within 30 days following the earlier of the
participant’s (i) death, (ii) retirement, (iii) total and permanent disability, (iv) separation
from service, or (v) some other date designated by the participant at the time of the initial
deferral. The Company’s contributions, including accrued interest, were $298,614, $464,902 and
$403,305 for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies:

Construction and Real Estate Commitments

We had commitments for new store construction projects totaling approximately $2.6 million at
December 27, 2008.

Litigation

We are involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. After
consultation with legal counsel, we expect these matters will be resolved without material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Any estimated loss related
to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and
reasonably estimable. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any
particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances
relating to these proceedings.

Note 12 — Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

Fair Value Measurements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”, (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, “Effective Date
of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP 157-2”), which amended SFAS 157 and delayed its effective date for
all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually).
FSP 157-2 defers the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008,
and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of FSP 157-2. We adopted
the remaining provisions of SFAS 157 effective December 30, 2007 (fiscal 2008). The adoption of
SFAS 157 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. The adoption
of FSP 157-2 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of
a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active”. This FSP clarifies the
application of SFAS 157 in an inactive market. The FASB also issued a joint press release with the
Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC on September 30, 2008 that addresses similar guidance to
what is contained in FSP FAS 157-3. The guidance in these two releases clarifies that observable
transactions in inactive markets may not be indicative of fair value, and in such instances, the
use of a reporting entity’s own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted
discount rates may provide a better estimate of an asset’s fair value. The application of this
guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible
financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates. Such election, which may be applied on
an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable
once elected. We adopted SFAS 159 effective December 30, 2007 (fiscal 2008). The adoption of SFAS
159 did not impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141R, which replaces SFAS 141. Whereas its predecessor
applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration,
the revised standard applies to all transactions or other events in which one entity obtains
control over another. SFAS 141R defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control over one or
more other businesses and defines the acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control.
SFAS 141R requires the acquirer to recognize assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date.
The revised standard changes the treatment of acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs
related to an acquisition that the acquirer expects but is not obligated to incur, contingent
consideration associated with the purchase price and preacquisition contingencies associated with
acquired assets and liabilities. SFAS 141R retains the guidance in SFAS 141 for identifying and
recognizing intangible assets apart from goodwill. The revised standard applies prospectively to
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Thus, we will be required to apply
the provisions of SFAS 141R to any business acquisition which occurs on or after December 28, 2008,
but this standard will have no effect on prior acquisitions.

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets”, which amends the factors that must be considered in developing renewal or extension
assumptions used to determine the useful life over which to amortize the cost of a recognized
intangible asset under SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”). The FSP
requires an entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of the term of the
arrangement, consistent with its expected use of the asset, and is an attempt to improve
consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period
of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141, “Business
Combinations.” The FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and the
guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied
prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The FSP is not expected to
have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles” (“SFAS 162”). The statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying
a consistent hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial
statements that are prepared in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles.
SFAS 162 was effective November 15, 2008 and did not have any impact on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash flow.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934
Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of December 27, 2008.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that, as of December 27, 2008, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the 1934 Act. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 27, 2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 27, 2008,
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the
Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued a report on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting, which is included herein.

Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

On January 16, 2009, we identified a material weakness in internal controls related to the LIFO
inventory valuation for each of the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal 2008. The actual LIFO
valuation is dependent upon end-of-year inventories, specifically the quantity and mix of product
and the inflation rate for the various categories of products. Since the actual valuation can only
be calculated at year-end, we record an estimated LIFO provision at the end of each interim
quarter. At year-end, when the key variables are known, the LIFO provision is adjusted to the
actual year-end calculation.

We developed a new interim LIFO projection model at the beginning of fiscal 2008 in an effort to
facilitate improved forecasting of both inventory mix and price inflation. At the end of fiscal
2008, an error was discovered in the LIFO projection model which resulted in an understatement of
the inflation indices. As a result, the quarterly LIFO provision to cost of merchandise sold for
each of the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal 2008 was understated.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

We did not have a sufficient review process for the new model used to forecast expected
inflation/deflation among the product categories, which led to a material misstatement of our
interim financial statements for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2008. We determined
that this was a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. In order to
remediate this material weakness, we have taken the following steps:

(1)

Corrected the LIFO projection model to properly calculate estimated annual
inflation rates and the projected end-of-year indices,

(2)

Performed additional analyses on the derivation of projected indices in each
interim LIFO calculation,

(3)

Expanded the review process for all input assumptions used in each interim LIFO
calculation, and

(4)

Further documented the procedures to review, approve and manage changes in the
process of estimating LIFO cost for interim periods.

Based on the implementation of the above steps, we have determined that the material weakness
related to the interim LIFO process has been remedied as of December 27, 2008.
