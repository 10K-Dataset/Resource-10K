PART I

Item 1.

Business

Our
    Company

Verisk Analytics, Inc. enables risk-bearing businesses to better
    understand and manage their risks. We provide value to our
    customers by supplying proprietary data that, combined with our
    analytic methods, creates embedded decision support solutions.
    We are the largest aggregator and provider of detailed actuarial
    and underwriting data pertaining to United States, or U.S.,
    property and casualty, or P&C, insurance risks. We offer
    solutions for detecting fraud in the U.S. P&C
    insurance, healthcare and mortgage industries, and sophisticated
    methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging
    from natural catastrophes to health insurance.

Our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions
    with greater efficiency and discipline. We refer to these
    products and services as ‘solutions’ due to the
    integration among our services and the flexibility that enables
    our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive
    package. These ‘solutions’ take various forms,
    including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all
    designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions. We
    believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our
    customers’ revenues and help them better manage their
    costs. In 2010, our U.S. customers included all of the top
    100 P&C insurance providers, numerous health plans and
    third-party administrators, five of the six leading mortgage
    insurers, and 16 of the top 20 mortgage lenders. We believe that
    our commitment to our customers and the embedded nature of our
    solutions serve to strengthen and extend our relationships.



We help those businesses address what we believe are the four
    primary decision making processes essential for managing risk as
    set forth below in the Verisk Risk Analysis Framework:

The
    Verisk Risk Analysis Framework

These four processes correspond to various functional areas
    inside our customers’ operations:

•

our loss prediction solutions are typically used by P&C
    insurance and healthcare actuaries, advanced analytics groups
    and loss control groups to help drive their own assessments of
    future losses;

•

our risk selection and pricing solutions are typically used by
    underwriters as they manage their books of business;

•

our fraud detection and prevention tools are used by P&C
    insurance, healthcare and mortgage underwriters to root out
    fraud prospectively and by claims departments to speed claims
    and find fraud retroactively; and

•

our tools to quantify loss are primarily used by claims
    departments, independent adjustors and contractors.

We add value by linking our solutions across these four key
    processes; for example, we use the same modeling methods to
    support the pricing of homeowner’s insurance policies and
    to quantify the actual losses when damage occurs to insured
    homes.

We offer our solutions and services primarily through annual
    subscriptions or long-term agreements, which are typically
    pre-paid and represented approximately 70.0% of our revenues in
    2010. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we had revenues
    of $1,138.3 million and net income of $242.6 million.
    For the five year period ended December 31, 2010, our
    revenues and net income grew at a Compound Annual Growth Rate,
    or CAGR, of 11.7% and 14.9%, respectively.

Our
    History

We trace our history to 1971, when Insurance Services Office,
    Inc., or ISO, started operations as a

not-for-profit

advisory and rating organization providing services for the
    U.S. P&C insurance industry. ISO was formed as an
    association of insurance companies to gather statistical data
    and other information from insurers and report to regulators, as
    required by law. ISO’s original functions also included
    developing programs to help insurers define and manage insurance
    products and providing information to help insurers determine
    their own independent premium rates. Insurers used and continue
    to use our offerings primarily in their product development,
    underwriting and rating functions. Today, those businesses form
    the core of our Risk Assessment segment.

Over the past decade, we have transformed our business beyond
    its original functions by deepening and broadening our data
    assets, developing a set of integrated risk management solutions
    and services and addressing new markets through our Decision
    Analytics segment.

Our expansion into analytics began when we acquired the American
    Insurance Services Group, or AISG, and certain operations and
    assets of the National Insurance Crime Bureau in 1997 and 1998,
    respectively. Those organizations brought to the company large
    databases of insurance claims, as well as expertise in detecting
    and preventing claims fraud. To further expand our Decision
    Analytics segment, we acquired AIR Worldwide, or AIR, in 2002,
    the technological leader in catastrophe modeling. In 2004, we
    entered the healthcare space by acquiring several businesses
    that now offer web-based analytical and reporting systems for
    health insurers, provider organizations and self-insured
    employers. In 2005 we entered the mortgage sector, acquiring the
    first of several businesses that now provide automated fraud
    detection,



compliance and decision support solutions for the
    U.S. mortgage industry. In 2006, to bolster our position in
    the claims field we acquired Xactware, a leading supplier of
    estimating software for professionals involved in building
    repair and reconstruction. In 2010, we acquired 3E Company,
    creating a scale presence in supply chain and environmental
    health and safety.

These acquisitions have added scale, geographic reach, highly
    skilled workforces, and a wide array of new capabilities to our
    Decision Analytics segment. They have helped to make us a
    leading provider of information and decision analytics for
    customers involved in the business of risk in the U.S. and
    selectively around the world.

Our senior management operating team, which includes our chief
    executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating
    officer, general counsel, and three senior officers who lead our
    business units, have been with us for an average of almost
    twenty years. This team has led our transformation to a
    successful for-profit entity, focused on growth with our
    U.S. P&C insurer customers and expansion into a
    variety of new markets.

On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our initial public
    offering, or IPO, ISO formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or Verisk,
    a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for our
    business. Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of ISO. On October 6, 2009, in connection with
    our IPO, the company effected a reorganization whereby ISO
    became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk. Verisk Class A
    common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on
    October 7, 2009 under the symbol “VRSK.”

Segments

We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and
    Decision Analytics.

Risk
    Assessment Segment

Our Risk Assessment segment serves our P&C insurance
    customers and focuses on the first two decision making processes
    in our Risk Analysis Framework: loss prediction and selection
    and pricing of risk. Within this segment, we also provide
    solutions to help our insurance customers comply with their
    reporting requirements in each U.S. state in which they
    operate. Our customers include most of the P&C insurance
    providers in the U.S.

Industry-Standard
    Insurance Programs

We are the recognized leader in the U.S. for
    industry-standard insurance programs that help P&C insurers
    define coverages and issue policies. Our policy language,
    prospective loss cost information and policy writing rules can
    serve as integrated turnkey insurance programs for our
    customers. Insurance companies need to ensure that their policy
    language, rules, and rates comply with all applicable legal and
    regulatory requirements. Insurers must also make sure their
    policies remain competitive by promptly changing coverages in
    response to changes in statutes or case law. To meet their
    needs, we process and interface with state regulators on average
    over 4,000 filings each year, ensuring smooth implementation of
    our rules and forms. When insurers choose to develop their own
    alternative programs, our industry-standard insurance programs
    also help regulators make sure that such insurers’ policies
    meet basic coverage requirements.

Standardized coverage language, which has been tested in
    litigation and tailored to reflect judicial interpretation,
    helps to ensure consistent treatment of claimants. As a result,
    our industry-standard language also simplifies claim settlements
    and can reduce the occurrence of costly litigation, because our
    language causes the meaning of coverage terminology to become
    established and known. Our policy language includes standard
    coverage language, endorsements and policy writing support
    language that assist our customers in understanding the risks
    they assume and the coverages they are offering. With these
    policy programs, insurers also benefit from economies of scale.
    We have over 200 specialized lawyers and insurance experts
    reviewing changes in each state’s insurance rules and
    regulations, including on average over 11,200 legislative bills,



1,100 regulatory actions and 2,000 court cases per year, to make
    any required changes to our policy language and rating
    information.

To cover the wide variety of risks in the marketplace, we offer
    a broad range of policy programs. For example, in the
    homeowner’s line of insurance, we maintain policy language
    and rules for six basic coverages, 178 national endorsements,
    and 495 state-specific endorsements. Overall, we provide
    policy language, prospective loss costs, policy writing rules,
    and a variety of other solutions for 25 lines of insurance.

Property-Specific
    Rating and Underwriting Information

We gather information on individual properties and communities
    so that insurers can use our information to evaluate and price
    personal and commercial property insurance, as well as
    commercial liability insurance. Our property-specific rating and
    underwriting information allow our customers to understand,
    quantify, underwrite, mitigate, and avoid potential loss for
    residential and commercial properties. Our database contains
    loss costs and other vital information on approximately
    3.0 million commercial buildings in the United States and
    also holds information on approximately 5.8 million
    individual businesses occupying those buildings. We have a staff
    of approximately 600 field representatives strategically located
    around the United States who observe and report on conditions at
    commercial and residential properties, evaluate community
    fire-protection capabilities and assess the effectiveness of
    municipal building-code enforcement. Each year, our field staff
    visits over 350,000 commercial properties to collect information
    on new buildings and verify building attributes.

We also provide proprietary analytic measures of the ability of
    individual communities to mitigate losses from important perils.
    Nearly every property insurer in the U.S. uses our
    evaluations of community firefighting capabilities to help
    determine premiums for fire insurance throughout the country. We
    provide field-verified and validated data on the fire protection
    services for more than 46,000 fire response jurisdictions. We
    also offer services to evaluate the effectiveness of community
    enforcement of building codes and the efforts of communities to
    mitigate damage from flooding. Further, we provide information
    on the insurance rating territories, premium taxes, crime risk,
    and hazards of windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, and other
    perils. To supplement our data on specific commercial properties
    and individual communities, we have assembled, from a variety of
    internal and third-party sources, information on hazards related
    to geographic locations representing every postal address in the
    U.S. Insurers use this information not only for policy
    quoting but also for analyzing risk concentration in
    geographical areas.

Statistical
    Agent and Data Services

The P&C insurance industry is heavily regulated in the
    U.S. P&C insurers are required to collect statistical
    data about their premiums and losses and to report that data to
    regulators in every state in which they operate. Our statistical
    agent services have enabled P&C insurers to meet these
    regulatory requirements for over 30 years. We aggregate the
    data and, as a licensed “statistical agent” in all
    50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, we
    report these statistics to insurance regulators. We are able to
    capture significant economies of scale given the level of
    penetration of this service within the U.S. P&C
    insurance industry.

To provide our customers and the regulators the information they
    require, we maintain one of the largest private databases in the
    world. Over the past four decades, we have developed core
    expertise in acquiring, processing, managing, and operating
    large and comprehensive databases that are the foundation of our
    Risk Assessment segment. We use our proprietary technology to
    assemble, organize and update vast amounts of detailed
    information submitted by our customers. We supplement this data
    with publicly available information.

Each year, P&C insurers send us approximately
    2.8 billion detailed individual records of insurance
    transactions, such as insurance premiums collected or losses
    incurred. We maintain a database of over 15.8 billion
    statistical records, including approximately 5.9 billion
    commercial lines records and approximately 9.9 billion
    personal lines records. We collect unit-transaction detail of
    each premium and loss record, which enhances the validity,
    reliability and accuracy of our data sets and our actuarial
    analyses. Our proprietary quality process includes almost 2,500
    separate checks to ensure that data meet our high standards of
    quality.



Actuarial
    Services

We provide actuarial services to help our customers price their
    risks as they underwrite. We project future losses and loss
    expenses utilizing a broad set of data. These projections tend
    to be more reliable than if our customers used solely their own
    data. We provide loss costs by coverage, class, territory, and
    many other categories. Our customers can use our estimates of
    future loss costs in making independent decisions about the
    prices charged for their policies. For most P&C insurers,
    in most lines of business, we believe our loss costs are an
    essential input to rating decisions. We make a number of
    actuarial adjustments, including loss development and loss
    adjustment expenses before the data is used to estimate future
    loss costs. Our actuarial services are also used to create the
    analytics underlying our industry-standard insurance programs
    described below.

Using our large database of premium and loss data, our actuaries
    are able to perform sophisticated analyses using our predictive
    models and analytic methods to help our P&C insurance
    customers with pricing, loss reserving, and marketing. We
    distribute a number of actuarial products and offer flexible
    services to meet our customers’ needs. In addition, our
    actuarial consultants provide customized services for our
    clients that include assisting them with the development of
    independent insurance programs, analysis of their own
    underwriting experience, development of classification systems
    and rating plans, and a wide variety of other business
    decisions. We also supply information to a wide variety of
    customers in other markets including reinsurance, government
    agencies and real estate.

Decision
    Analytics Segment

In the Decision Analytics segment, we support all four phases of
    our Risk Analysis Framework. We develop predictive models to
    forecast scenarios and produce both standard and customized
    analytics that help our customers better predict loss, select
    and price risk, detect fraud before and after a loss event, and
    quantify losses.

As we develop our models to quantify loss and detect fraud, we
    improve our ability to predict the loss and prevent the fraud
    from happening. We believe this provides us with a significant
    competitive advantage over firms that do not offer solutions
    which operate both before and after loss events.

Fraud
    Identification and Detection Solutions

P&C
    Insurance

We are a leading provider of fraud-detection tools for the
    P&C insurance industry. Our fraud solutions improve our
    customers’ profitability by both predicting the likelihood
    that fraud is occurring and detecting suspicious activity after
    it has occurred. When a claim is submitted, our system searches
    our database and returns information about other claims filed by
    the same individuals or businesses (either as



claimants or insurers) that help our customers determine if
    fraud has occurred. The system searches for matches in
    identifying information fields, such as name, address, Social
    Security number, vehicle identification number, driver’s
    license number, tax identification number, or other parties to
    the loss. Our system also includes advanced name and address
    searching to perform intelligent searches and improve the
    overall quality of the matches. Information from match reports
    speeds payment of meritorious claims while providing a defense
    against fraud and can lead to denial of a claim, negotiation of
    a reduced award or further investigation by the insurer or law
    enforcement.

We have a comprehensive system used by claims adjusters and
    investigations professionals to process claims and fight fraud.
    Claims databases are one of the key tools in the fight against
    insurance fraud. The benefits of a single all-claims database
    include improved efficiency in reporting data and searching for
    information, enhanced capabilities for detecting suspicious
    claims and superior information for investigating fraudulent
    claims, suspicious individuals and possible fraud rings. Our
    database contains information on more than 700 million
    claims and is the world’s largest database of claims
    information. Insurers and other participants submit new claim
    reports, more than 239,000 a day on average, across all
    categories of the U.S. P&C insurance industry.

We also provide a service allowing insurers to report thefts of
    automobiles and property, improving the chances of recovering
    those items; a service that helps owners and insurers recover
    stolen heavy construction and agricultural equipment; an expert
    scoring system that helps distinguish between suspicious and
    meritorious claims; and products that use link-analysis
    technology to help visualize and fight insurance fraud.

Mortgage

We are a leading provider of automated fraud detection,
    compliance and decision-support tools for the mortgage industry.
    Utilizing our own loan level application database combined with
    actual mortgage loan performance data, we have established a
    risk scoring system which increases our customers’ ability
    to detect fraud. We provide solutions that detect fraud through
    each step of the mortgage lifecycle and provide regulatory
    compliance solutions that perform instant compliance reviews of
    each mortgage application. Our fraud solutions can improve our
    customers’ profitability by predicting the likelihood that
    a customer account is experiencing fraud. Our solution analyzes
    customer transactions in real time and generates recommendations
    for immediate action which are critical to stopping fraud and
    abuse. These applications can also detect some organized fraud
    schemes that are too complex and well-hidden to be identified by
    other methods.

Effective fraud detection relies on pattern identification,
    which in turn requires us to identify, isolate and track
    mortgage applications through time. Histories of multiple loans,
    both valid and fraudulent, are required to compare a submitted
    loan both to actual data and heuristic analyses. For this
    reason, unless fraud detection solutions are fueled by
    comprehensive data, their practicality is limited. Our
    proprietary database contains more than 18 million current
    and historical loan applications collected over the past ten
    years. This database contains data from loan applications as
    well as supplementary third-party data.

Our technology employs sophisticated models to identify patterns
    in the data. Our solution provides a score, which predicts
    whether the information provided by a mortgage applicant is
    correct. Working with data obtained through our partnership with
    a credit bureau, we have demonstrated a strong correlation
    between fraudulent information in the application and the
    likelihood of both foreclosure and early payment default on
    loans. We believe our solution is based upon a more
    comprehensive set of loan level information than any other
    provider in the mortgage industry.

We also provide forensic audit services for the mortgage
    origination and mortgage insurance industries. Our predictive
    screening tools predict which defaulted loans are the most
    likely candidates for full audits for the purpose of detecting
    fraud. We then generate detailed audit reports on defaulted
    mortgage loans. Those reports serve as a key component of the
    loss mitigation strategies of mortgage loan insurers. The recent
    turmoil in the mortgage industry has created an opportunity for
    growth in demand for our services, as we believe most mortgage
    insurers do not have the in-house capacity to respond to and
    properly review all of their defaulted loans for evidence of
    fraud.



Healthcare

We offer solutions that help healthcare claims payors detect
    fraud, abuse and overpayment. Our approach combines
    computer-based modeling and profiling of claims with analysis
    performed by clinical experts. We run our customers’ claims
    through our proprietary analytic system to identify potential
    fraud, abuse and overpayment, and then a registered nurse,
    physician or other clinical specialist skilled in coding and
    reimbursement decisions reviews all suspect claims and billing
    patterns. This combination of system and human review is unique
    in the industry and we believe offers improved accuracy for
    paying claims.

We analyze the patterns of claims produced by individual
    physicians, physicians’ practices, hospitals, dentists, and
    pharmacies to locate the sources of fraud. After a suspicious
    source of claims is identified, our real-time analytic solutions
    investigate each claim individually for particular violations,
    including upcoding, multiple billings, services claimed but not
    rendered, and billing by unlicensed providers. By finding the
    individual claims with the most cost-recovery potential and also
    minimizing the number of false-positive indications of fraud, we
    enable the special investigation units of healthcare payors to
    efficiently control their claims costs while maintaining high
    levels of customer service to their insurers.

We also offer web-based reporting tools that let payors take
    definitive action to prevent overpayments or payment of
    fraudulent claims. The tools provide the documentation that
    helps to identify, investigate and prevent abusive and
    fraudulent activity by providers.

Loss
    Prediction

P&C
    Insurance

We pioneered the field of probabilistic catastrophe modeling
    used by insurers, reinsurers and financial institutions to
    manage their catastrophe risk. Our models of global natural
    hazards, which form the basis of our solutions, enable companies
    to identify, quantify and plan for the financial consequences of
    catastrophic events. We have developed models, covering natural
    hazards, including hurricanes, earthquakes, winter storms,
    tornadoes, hailstorms, and flood, for potential loss events in
    more than 50 countries. We have also developed and introduced a
    probabilistic terrorism model capable of quantifying the risk in
    the U.S. from this emerging threat, which supports pricing
    and underwriting decisions down to the level of an individual
    policy.

Healthcare

We are a leading provider of healthcare business intelligence
    and predictive modeling. We provide analytical and reporting
    systems to health insurers, provider organizations and
    self-insured employers. Those organizations use our solutions to
    review their healthcare data, including information on claims,
    membership, providers and utilization, and provide cost trends,
    forecasts and actuarial, financial and utilization analyses.

For example, our solutions allow our customers to predict
    medical costs and improve the financing and organization of
    health services. Our predictive models help our customers
    identify high-cost cases for care- and disease-management
    intervention, compare providers adjusting for differences in
    health, predict resource use for individuals and populations,
    establish health-based and performance-based payments, negotiate
    payments and incentives, negotiate premium rates, and measure
    return on investment.

We also provide our customers healthcare consulting services
    using complex clinical analyses to uncover reasons behind cost
    and utilization increases. Physicians and hospitals are adopting
    and acquiring new technologies, drugs and devices more rapidly
    than ever before. We provide financial and actuarial consulting,
    clinical consulting, technical and implementation services and
    training services to help our customers manage costs and risks
    to their practices.



Loss
    Quantification

P&C
    Insurance

We provide data, analytic and networking products for
    professionals involved in estimating all phases of building
    repair and reconstruction. We provide solutions for every phase
    of a building’s life, including:

•

estimating replacement costs during the insurance underwriting
    process;

•

quantifying the ultimate cost of repair or reconstruction of
    damaged or destroyed buildings;

•

aiding in the settlement of insurance claims; and

•

tracking the process of repair or reconstruction and
    facilitating communication among insurers, adjusters,
    contractors and policyholders.

To help our customers estimate repair costs, we also provide a
    solution that assists contractors and insurance adjusters to
    estimate repairs using a patented plan-sketching program. The
    program allows our customers to sketch floor plans, roof plans
    and wall-framing plans and automatically calculates material and
    labor quantities for the construction of walls, floors, footings
    and roofs.

We also offer our customers access to wholesale and retail price
    lists, which include structural repair and restoration pricing
    for 467 separate economic areas in North America. We revise this
    information monthly and, in the aftermath of a major disaster,
    we can update the price lists as often as weekly to reflect
    rapid price changes. Our structural repair and cleaning database
    contains more than 13,000 unit-cost line items. For each
    line item such as smoke cleaning, water extraction and hazardous
    cleanup, we provide time and material pricing, including labor,
    labor productivity rates (for new construction and restoration),
    labor burden and overhead, material costs, and equipment costs.
    We improve our pricing data by analyzing the actual claims
    experience of our customers to verify our estimates. We estimate
    that more than 75.0% of all homeowners’ claims settled in
    the U.S. annually use our solution. Such a large percentage
    of the industry’s claims leads to accurate pricing
    information, which we believe is unmatched in the industry.

Our estimates allow our customers to set loss reserves, deploy
    field adjusters and verify internal company estimates. Our
    estimates also keep insurers, their customers, regulators, and
    other interested parties informed about the total costs of
    disasters. We also provide our customers access to daily reports
    on severe weather and catastrophes and we maintain a database of
    information on catastrophe losses in the U.S. since 1950.

Our
    Growth Strategy

Over the past five years, we have grown our revenues at a CAGR
    of 11.7% through the successful execution of our business plan.
    These results reflect strong organic revenue growth, new product
    development and selected acquisitions. We have made, and
    continue to make, investments in people, data sets, analytic
    solutions, technology, and complementary businesses. The key
    components of our strategy include:

Increase Sales to Insurance
    Customers.

We expect to expand the
    application of our solutions in insurance customers’
    internal risk and underwriting processes. Building on our deep
    knowledge of, and embedded position in, the insurance industry,
    we expect to sell more solutions to existing customers tailored
    to individual insurance segments. By increasing the breadth and
    relevance of our offerings, we believe we can strengthen our
    relationships with customers and increase our value to their
    decision making in critical ways.

Develop New, Proprietary Data Sets and Predictive
    Analytics.

We work with our customers to
    understand their evolving needs. We plan to create new solutions
    by enriching our mix of proprietary data sets, analytic
    solutions and effective decision support across the markets we
    serve. We constantly seek to add new data sets that can further
    leverage our analytic methods, technology platforms and
    intellectual capital.



Leverage Our Intellectual Capital to Expand into Adjacent
    Markets and New Customer Sectors.

Our
    organization is built on nearly four decades of intellectual
    property in risk management. We believe we can continue to
    profitably expand the use of our intellectual capital and apply
    our analytic methods in new markets, where significant
    opportunities for long-term growth exist. We have already
    demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy with our
    expansion into healthcare and non-insurance financial services.
    We also continue to pursue growth through targeted international
    expansion.

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions that Complement Our
    Leadership Positions.

We will continue to
    expand our data and analytics capabilities across industries.
    While we expect this will occur primarily through organic
    growth, we have and will continue to acquire assets and
    businesses that strengthen our value proposition to customers.
    We have developed an internal capability to source, evaluate and
    integrate acquisitions that have created value for shareholders.

Our
    Customers

Risk
    Assessment Customers

The customers in our Risk Assessment segment include the top 100
    P&C insurance providers in the United States. Our
    statistical agent services are used by a substantial majority of
    P&C insurance providers in the U.S. to report to
    regulators. Our actuarial services and industry-standard
    insurance programs are used by the majority of insurers and
    reinsurers in the U.S. In addition, certain agencies of the
    federal government, as well as county and state governmental
    agencies and organizations, use our solutions to help satisfy
    government needs for risk assessment and emergency response
    information. In 2010 our largest Risk Assessment customer
    accounted for 4.8% of segment revenues and our top ten customers
    accounted for 26.9% of segment revenues. See Item 13.
    “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and
    Director Independence — Customer Relationships”
    for more information on our relationship with our principal
    stockholders.

Decision
    Analytics Customers

In the Decision Analytics segment, we provide our P&C
    insurance solutions to the majority of the P&C insurers in
    the U.S. Specifically, our claims database serves thousands
    of customers, representing nearly 93.0% of the P&C
    insurance industry by premium volume, 26 state
    workers’ compensation insurance funds, 607 self-insurers,
    455 third-party administrators, several state fraud bureaus, and
    many law-enforcement agencies involved in investigation and
    prosecution of insurance fraud. Also, P&C insurance
    companies using our building and repair solutions represent over
    75.0% of the property market in the U.S. We estimate that
    more than 80.0% of insurance repair contractors and service
    providers in the U.S. and Canada with computerized
    estimating systems use our building and repair pricing data.

In the U.S. healthcare industry, our customers include
    numerous health plans and third party administrators. In the
    U.S. mortgage industry, we have more than 900 customers. We
    provide our solutions to 16 of the top 20 mortgage lenders and
    five of the top six mortgage insurers. We have been providing
    services to mortgage insurers for over 20 years. In 2010,
    our largest customer in the Decision Analytics segment accounted
    for 9.0% of segment revenues and our top ten Decision Analytics
    customers accounted for 29.6% of segment revenues.

Our
    Competitors

We believe no single competitor currently offers the same scope
    of services and market coverage we provide. The breadth of
    markets we serve exposes us to a broad range of competitors.

Risk
    Assessment Competitors

Our Risk Assessment segment operates primarily in the
    U.S. P&C insurance industry, where we enjoy a leading
    market presence. We have a number of competitors in specific
    lines or services.



We encounter competition from a number of sources, including
    insurers who develop internal technology and actuarial methods
    for proprietary insurance programs. Competitors also include
    other statistical agents, including the National Independent
    Statistical Service, the Independent Statistical Service and
    other advisory organizations, providing underwriting rules,
    prospective loss costs and coverage language such as the
    American Association of Insurance Services and Mutual Services
    Organization, although we believe none of our competitors has
    the breadth or depth of data we have.

Competitors for our property-specific rating and underwriting
    information are primarily limited to a number of regional
    providers of commercial property inspections and surveys,
    including Overland Solutions, Inc. and Regional Reporting, Inc.
    We also compete with a variety of organizations that offer
    consulting services, primarily specialty technology and
    consulting firms. In addition, a customer may use its own
    internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these
    services. Our competitors also include information technology
    product and services vendors including CDS, Inc., management and
    strategy consulting firms including Deloitte Consulting LLP, and
    smaller specialized information technology firms and analytical
    services firms including Pinnacle Consulting and EMB.

Decision
    Analytics Competitors

In the P&C insurance claims market and catastrophe modeling
    market, certain products are offered by a number of companies,
    including Risk Management Solutions (catastrophe modeling),
    LexisNexis/ChoicePoint (loss histories and motor vehicle records
    for personal lines underwriting), MSB (property value and claims
    estimator), and Explore Information Services (personal
    automobile underwriting). We believe that our P&C insurance
    industry expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple
    applications, services and integrated solutions to individual
    customers, enhances our competitiveness against these
    competitors with more limited offerings. In the healthcare
    market, certain products are offered by a number of companies,
    including Computer Sciences Corporation (evaluation of bodily
    injury and workers’ compensation claims), Fair Isaac
    Corporation (workers’ compensation and healthcare claims
    cost containment) and Ingenix, McKesson and Medstat (healthcare
    predictive modeling and business intelligence). Competitive
    factors include application features and functions, ease of
    delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain,
    enhance and support the applications or services and price. In
    the mortgage analytics solutions market, our competitors include
    CoreLogic and DataVerify Corporation (mortgage lending fraud
    identification). We believe that none of our competitors in the
    mortgage analytics market offers the same combination of
    expertise in fraud detection analytics and forensic audit
    capabilities.

Development
    of New Solutions

We take a market-focused team approach to developing our
    solutions. Our operating units are responsible for developing,
    reviewing and enhancing our various products and services. Our
    data management and production team designs and manages our
    processes and systems for market data procurement, proprietary
    data production and quality control. Our Enterprise Data
    Management, or EDM, team supports our efforts to create new
    information and products from available data and explores new
    methods of collecting data. EDM is focused on understanding and
    documenting

business-unit

and corporate data assets and data issues; sharing and combining
    data assets across the enterprise; creating an enterprise data
    strategy; facilitating research and product development; and
    promoting cross-enterprise communication. Our ISO Innovative
    Analytics, or IIA, team is a center of excellence inside the
    corporation for developing analytical methods in applying
    modeling techniques to predict risk outcomes.

Our software development team builds the technology used in many
    of our solutions. As part of our product-development process, we
    continually solicit feedback from our customers on the value of
    our products and services and the market’s needs. We have
    established an extensive system of customer advisory panels,
    which meet regularly throughout the year to help us respond
    effectively to the needs of our markets. In addition, we use
    frequent sales calls, executive visits, user group meetings, and
    other industry forums to gather information to match the needs
    of the market with our product development efforts. We also use
    a variety of market research techniques to enhance our
    understanding of our clients and the markets in which they
    operate.



We also add to our offerings through an active acquisition
    program. Since 2006, we have acquired 15 businesses, which have
    allowed us to enter new markets, offer new products and enhance
    the value of existing products with additional proprietary
    sources of data.

When we find it advantageous, we augment our proprietary data
    sources and systems by forming alliances with other leading
    information providers and technology companies and integrating
    their product offerings into our offerings. This approach gives
    our customers the opportunity to obtain the information they
    need from a single source and more easily integrate the
    information into their workflows.

Sales,
    Marketing and Customer Support

We sell our products and services primarily through direct
    interaction with our clients. We employ a three-tier sales
    structure that includes salespeople, product specialists and
    sales support. As of December 31, 2010, we had a sales
    force of 268 people. Within the company, several areas have
    sales teams that specialize in specific products and services.
    These specialized sales teams sell specific, highly technical
    product sets to targeted markets.

To provide account management to our largest customers, we
    segment the insurance carrier market into three groups.
    Tier One or “National” Accounts constitutes our
    largest customers, Tier Two or “Strategic”
    Accounts represents both larger carrier groups and middle-market
    carriers. Tier Three are the small insurance companies that
    may represent one line of business

and/or

regional writers for a few states. A Sales Generalist is
    assigned to every insurer account and is responsible for our
    overall relationship with these insurance companies. Our senior
    executives are also involved with the senior management of our
    customers.

Salespeople participate in both customer-service and sales
    activities. They provide direct support, interacting frequently
    with assigned customers to assure a positive experience using
    our services. Salespeople primarily seek out new sales
    opportunities and work with the various sales teams to
    coordinate sales activity and provide the best solutions for our
    customers. We believe our salespeople’s product knowledge
    and local presence differentiates us from our competition.
    Product specialists are subject-matter experts and work with
    salespeople on specific opportunities for their assigned
    products. Both salespeople and product specialists have
    responsibility for identifying new sales opportunities. A team
    approach and a common customer relationship management system
    allow for effective coordination between the two groups.

Sources
    of our Data

The data we use to perform our analytics and power our solutions
    are sourced through six different kinds of data arrangements.
    First, we gather data from our customers within agreements that
    also permit our customers to use the solutions created upon
    their data. These agreements remain in effect unless the data
    contributor chooses to opt out and represent our primary method
    of data gathering. It is very rare that contributors elect not
    to continue providing us data. Second, we have agreements with
    data contributors in which we specify the particular uses of
    their data and provide to the data contributors their required
    levels of privacy, protection of data and where necessary
    de-identification of data. These agreements represent no cost to
    us and generally feature a specified period of time for the data
    contributions and require renewal. Third, we “mine”
    data found inside the transactions supported by our solutions;
    as an example, we utilize the claims settlement data generated
    inside our repair cost estimating solution to improve the cost
    factors used in our models. Again, these arrangements represent
    no cost to us and we obtain the consent of our customers to make
    use of their data in this way. Fourth, we source data generally
    at no cost from public sources including federal, state and
    local governments. Fifth, we gather data about the physical
    characteristics of commercial properties through the direct
    observation of our field staff that also perform property
    surveys at the request of, and facilitated by, property
    insurers. Lastly, we purchase data from data aggregators under
    contracts that reflect prevailing market pricing for the data
    elements purchased, including county tax assessor records,
    descriptions of hazards such as flood plains and professional
    licenses. In all our modes of data collection, we are the owners
    of whatever derivative solutions we create using the data. Our
    costs of data received from our customers were 1.7% and 1.9% of
    revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.



Information
    Technology

Technology

Our information technology systems are fundamental to our
    success. They are used for the storage, processing, access and
    delivery of the data which forms the foundation of our business
    and the development and delivery of our solutions provided to
    our clients. Much of the technology we use and provide to our
    customers is developed, maintained and supported by
    approximately 1,050 employees. We generally own or have
    secured ongoing rights to use for the purposes of our business
    all the customer-facing applications which are material to our
    operations. We support and implement a mix of technologies,
    focused on implementing the most efficient technology for any
    given business requirement or task.

Data
    Centers

We have two primary data centers in Jersey City, New Jersey and
    Orem, Utah. In addition, we have data centers dedicated to
    certain business units, including AIR and Verisk Health in
    Boston and AISG Claimsearch in Israel. In addition to these key
    data centers, we also have a number of smaller data centers
    located in other states.

Disaster
    Recovery

We are committed to a framework for business continuity
    management and carry out annual reviews of the state of
    preparedness of each business unit. All of our critical
    databases, systems and contracted client services are also
    regularly recovered. We also have documented disaster recovery
    plans in place for each of our major data centers and each of
    our solutions. Our primary data center recovery site is in New
    York State, approximately 50 miles northwest of Jersey
    City, New Jersey.

Security

We have adopted a wide range of measures to ensure the security
    of our IT infrastructure and data. Security measures generally
    cover the following key areas: physical security; logical
    security of the perimeter; network security such as firewalls;
    logical access to the operating systems; deployment of virus
    detection software; and appropriate policies and procedures
    relating to removable media such as laptops. All laptops are
    encrypted and media leaving our premises that is sent to a
    third-party storage facility is also encrypted. This commitment
    has led us to achieve certification from CyberTrust (an industry
    leader in information security certification) since 2002.

Intellectual
    Property

We own a significant number of intellectual property rights,
    including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents.
    Specifically, our policy language, insurance manuals, software
    and databases are protected by both registered and common law
    copyrights, and the licensing of those materials to our
    customers for their use represents a large portion of our
    revenue. We also own in excess of 500 trademarks in the
    U.S. and foreign countries, including the names of our
    products and services and our logos and tag lines, many of which
    are registered. We believe many of our trademarks, trade names,
    service marks and logos to be of material importance to our
    business as they assist our customers in identifying our
    products and services and the quality that stands behind them.
    We consider our intellectual property to be proprietary, and we
    rely on a combination of statutory (e.g., copyright, trademark,
    trade secret and patent) and contractual safeguards in a
    comprehensive intellectual property enforcement program to
    protect them wherever they are used.

We also own several software method and processing patents and
    have several pending patent applications in the U.S. that
    complement our products. The patents and patent applications
    include claims which pertain to technology, including a patent
    for our Claims Outcome Advisor software, and for our Xactware
    Sketch product. We believe the protection of our proprietary
    technology is important to our success and we will continue to
    seek to protect those intellectual property assets for which we
    have expended substantial research and development capital and
    which are material to our business.



In order to maintain control of our intellectual property, we
    enter into license agreements with our customers, granting each
    customer a license to use our products and services, including
    our software and databases. This helps to maintain the integrity
    of our proprietary intellectual property and to protect the
    embedded information and technology contained in our solutions.
    As a general practice, employees, contractors and other parties
    with access to our proprietary information sign agreements that
    prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary
    rights, information and technology.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we employed 4,706 full-time
    and 184 part-time employees. None of our employees are
    represented by unions. We consider our relationship with our
    employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of
    operations due to labor disagreements.

Our employees include over 200 actuarial professionals,
    including 43 Fellows and 27 Associates of the Casualty Actuarial
    Society, as well as 143 Chartered Property Casualty
    Underwriters, 17 Certified and 22 Associate Insurance Data
    Managers, and over 565 professionals with advanced degrees,
    including PhDs in mathematics and statistical modeling who
    review both the data and the models.

Regulation

Because our business involves the distribution of certain
    personal, public and non-public data to businesses and
    governmental entities that make eligibility, service and
    marketing decisions based on such data, certain of our solutions
    and services are subject to regulation under federal, state and
    local laws in the United States and, to a lesser extent,
    foreign countries. Examples of such regulation include the Fair
    Credit Reporting Act, which regulates the use of consumer credit
    report information; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which regulates
    the use of non-public personal financial information held by
    financial institutions and applies indirectly to companies that
    provide services to financial institutions; the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act, which restricts the public
    disclosure of patient information and applies indirectly to
    companies that provide services to healthcare businesses; the
    Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits the public
    disclosure, use or resale by any state’s department of
    motor vehicles of personal information about an individual that
    was obtained by the department in connection with a motor
    vehicle record, except for a “permissible purpose” and
    various other federal, state and local laws and regulations.

These laws generally restrict the use and disclosure of personal
    information and provide consumers certain rights to know the
    manner in which their personal information is being used, to
    challenge the accuracy of such information

and/or

to
    prevent the use and disclosure of such information. In certain
    instances, these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding
    personal information through the issuance of data security
    standards or guidelines. Certain state laws impose similar
    privacy obligations, as well as obligations to provide
    notification of security breaches in certain circumstances.

We are also licensed as a rating, rate service, advisory or
    statistical organization under state insurance codes in all
    fifty states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and the
    District of Columbia. As such an advisory organization, we
    provide statistical, actuarial, policy language development and
    related products and services to property/casualty insurers,
    including advisory prospective loss costs, other prospective
    cost information, manual rules and policy language. We also
    serve as an officially designated statistical agent of state
    insurance regulators to collect policy-writing and loss
    statistics of individual insurers and compile that information
    into reports used by the regulators.

Many of our products, services and operations as well as insurer
    use of our services are subject to state rather than federal
    regulation by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. As a result,
    many of our operations and products are subject to review

and/or

approval by state regulators. Furthermore, our operations
    involving licensed advisory organization activities are subject
    to periodic examinations conducted by state regulators and our
    operations and products are subject to state antitrust and trade
    practice statutes within or outside state insurance codes, which
    are typically enforced by state attorneys general

and/or

insurance regulators.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

You should carefully consider the following risks and all of
    the other information set forth in this annual report on

Form 10-K

before deciding to invest in shares of our Class A common
    stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our
    business, financial condition or results of operations would
    likely suffer. In such case, the trading price of our
    Class A common stock could decline due to any of these
    risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

We
    could lose our access to data from external sources which could
    prevent us from providing our solutions.

We depend upon data from external sources, including data
    received from customers and various government and public record
    services, for information used in our databases. In general, we
    do not own the information in these databases, and the
    participating organizations could discontinue contributing
    information to the databases. Our data sources could withdraw or
    increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and
    we could also become subject to legislative or judicial
    restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data
    is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us
    to legally use

and/or

process the data. In addition, some of our customers are
    significant stockholders of our company. Specifically, all of
    our outstanding Class B common stock is owned by insurers
    who are also our customers and provide us with a significant
    percentage of our data. If our customers’ percentage of
    ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can
    be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data
    to the same extent or on the same terms. If a substantial number
    of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be
    unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to
    data due to government regulation or if the collection of data
    became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our
    customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely
    affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating
    results and cash flows.

Agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements.
    Some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us
    vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some
    suppliers not to renew certain agreements. Our competitors could
    also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. If
    our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be
    precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or
    restricted in our use of such data, which would give our
    competitors an advantage. Such a termination or exclusive
    contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial position, and operating results if we were unable to
    arrange for substitute sources.

We
    derive a substantial portion of our revenues from U.S. P&C
    primary insurers. If the downturn in the U.S. insurance industry
    continues or that industry does not continue to accept our
    solutions, our revenues will decline.

Revenues derived from solutions we provide to U.S. P&C
    primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total
    revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    approximately 57% of our revenue was derived from solutions
    provided to U.S. P&C primary insurers. Also, sales of
    certain of our solutions are tied to premiums in the
    U.S. P&C insurance market, which may rise or fall in
    any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and
    other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control. In
    addition, our



revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not
    continue to accept our solutions. Factors that might affect the
    acceptance of these solutions by P&C primary insurers
    include the following:

•

changes in the business analytics industry;

•

changes in technology;

•

our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data
    in our insurance solutions;

•

saturation of market demand;

•

loss of key customers;

•

industry consolidation; and

•

failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach.

A continued downturn in the insurance industry or lower
    acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could
    result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flows.

Our
    revenue from customers in the mortgage vertical is largely
    transactional and subject to changing conditions of the U.S.
    mortgage market.

Revenue derived from solutions we provide the U.S. mortgage
    and mortgage-related industries accounted for approximately 13%
    of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Our forensic audit business and business with
    government-sponsored entities in the mortgage business accounted
    for approximately 65% of our total mortgage and mortgage-related
    revenue in 2010. Because our business relies on transaction
    volumes based on both new mortgage applications and forensic
    audit of funded loans, reductions in either the volume of
    mortgage loans originated or the number or quality of funded
    loans could reduce our revenue. Mortgage origination volumes in
    2010 declined versus 2009 and may continue to decline based on
    the changes in the mortgage market related to the
    U.S. mortgage crisis.

Recently there have been proposals to restructure or eliminate
    the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The restructuring or
    elimination of either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could have a
    negative effect on the U. S. mortgage market and on our revenue
    derived from the solutions we provide to the mortgage industry.
    If origination volumes and applications for mortgages decline,
    our revenue in this part of the business may decline if we are
    unable to increase the percentage of mortgages examined for
    existing customers or add new customers. Our forensic audit
    business has benefited from the high amount of bad loans to be
    examined by mortgage insurers and other parties as a result of
    the U.S. mortgage crisis. Two customers represent the
    majority of our mortgage revenue in 2010 and if their volumes
    decline and we are not able to replace them with new customers,
    our revenue may decline.

There
    may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would
    reduce the use of our services.

Mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the
    number of our customers and potential customers. This could
    adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce
    the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the
    consolidated entities. If our customers merge with or are
    acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that
    use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their
    use of our services. The adverse effects of consolidation will
    be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon,
    for example, in the P&C insurance services sector. Any of
    these developments could materially and adversely affect our
    business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

If we
    are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we
    experience defects, failures and delays associated with the
    introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious
    harm.

Our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and
    sell new solutions. If we are unable to develop new solutions,
    or if we are not successful in introducing

and/or

obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions,
    we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur
    more slowly



than we anticipate. In addition, significant undetected errors
    or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our
    solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or
    results of operations. In the past, we have experienced delays
    while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to
    difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting
    to particular operating environments. Errors or defects in our
    solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be
    significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage
    to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development
    resources, an increase in product liability claims, and
    increases in service and support costs and warranty claims.

We
    will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if
    we are unable to protect them, our business could be
    harmed.

Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property
    rights. To date, we have relied primarily on a combination of
    copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and
    nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and
    distribution to protect our proprietary technology. This
    protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our
    proprietary technology could be used by others without our
    consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to
    our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may
    not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of
    competitive products. Any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or
    failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively
    impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business.
    Our protection of our intellectual property rights in the United
    States or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our
    competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our
    consent. Furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our
    intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or
    to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of
    others. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and
    diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We
    could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which
    if successful could restrict us from using and providing our
    technologies and solutions to our customers.

There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings,
    particularly in the United States, regarding patent and other
    intellectual property rights in the information technology
    industry. There is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the
    future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third
    parties. We monitor third-party patents and patent applications
    that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we
    carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate.
    However, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is
    unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be
    possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent
    applications. Since the patent application process can take
    several years to complete, there may be currently pending
    applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued
    patents that cover our products and technologies. As a result,
    we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which
    we are not aware. As we expand our operations there is a higher
    risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property
    rights of third parties.

Third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any
    resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or
    providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict
    us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or
    operating our business generally, or require changes to be made
    to our technologies and solutions. Even if we prevail,
    litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would
    result in the diversion of management’s time and attention.

If a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and
    we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or
    to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this
    could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation,
    financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

Regulatory
    developments could negatively impact our business.

Because personal, public and non-public information is stored in
    some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government
    regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data.
    We provide many types of data and services that already are
    subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Driver’s Privacy Protection Act,
    Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the



European Union’s Data Protection Directive and to a lesser
    extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and
    regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect
    the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal
    information in the marketplace. However, many consumer
    advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe
    that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect
    privacy. They have become increasingly concerned with the use of
    personal information, particularly social security numbers,
    department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. As a
    result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the
    dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the
    public and private sectors. Similar initiatives are under way in
    other countries in which we do business or from which we source
    data. The following legal and regulatory developments also could
    have a material adverse affect on our business, financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows:

•

amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations
    which restrict the access and use of personal information and
    reduce the supply of data available to customers;

•

changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further
    restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may
    lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our
    solutions;

•

failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and
    regulations; and

•

failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory
    environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner.

Fraudulent
    data access and other security breaches may negatively impact
    our business and harm our reputation.

Security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and
    databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and
    result in a loss of customers. Our systems may be vulnerable to
    physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and
    similar disruptive problems. Third-party contractors also may
    experience security breaches involving the storage and
    transmission of proprietary information. If users gain improper
    access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish,
    delete or modify confidential third-party information that is
    stored or transmitted on our networks.

In addition, customers’ misuse of our information services
    could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in
    loss of customers. Any such misappropriation

and/or

misuse of our information could result in us, among other
    things, being in breach of certain data protection and related
    legislation.

A security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways:

•

deterring customers from using our solutions;

•

deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us;

•

harming our reputation;

•

exposing us to liability;

•

increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the
    breach;

•

affecting our ability to meet customers’
    expectations; or

•

causing inquiry from governmental authorities.

We may detect incidents in which consumer data has been
    fraudulently or improperly acquired. The number of potentially
    affected consumers identified by any future incidents is
    obviously unknown. Any such incident could materially and
    adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition,
    operating results and cash flows.



We
    typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that
    requires significant resource commitments, which result in a
    long lead time before we receive revenues from new
    relationships.

We typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract
    and there is generally a long preparation period in order to
    commence providing the services. We typically incur significant
    business development expenses during the selling cycle and we
    may not succeed in winning a new customer’s business, in
    which case we receive no revenues and may receive no
    reimbursement for such expenses. Even if we succeed in
    developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may
    not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the
    selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after
    the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

We may
    lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity
    or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet,
    or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability
    to do business.

Our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of
    third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several
    critical functions, to protect data centers and related
    technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, power
    loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches
    in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural
    disasters, or other disasters. The on-line services we provide
    are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. In
    addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues
    through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the
    acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and
    services and responding to customer inquiries. We may not have
    sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in
    all of these areas in a timely manner. Certain of our customer
    contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be
    unavailable for specified periods of time. Any damage to our
    data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or
    inability to access these telesales centers or websites could
    cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely
    affect our ability to meet customers’ requirements,
    resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings
    per share.

We are
    subject to competition in many of the markets in which we
    operate and we may not be able to compete
    effectively.

Some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide
    growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are
    expected to remain highly competitive. We compete on the basis
    of quality, customer service, product and service selection and
    price. Our competitive position in various market segments
    depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment
    and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. Due to
    their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater
    resources to a particular market segment than we can. As a
    result, these competitors may be in a better position to
    anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences,
    emerging technologies and market trends. In addition, new
    competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away.
    We may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our
    market segments, especially against larger competitors. We may
    also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete.
    If we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial
    position and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Acquisitions
    could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other
    harmful consequences.

Our long-term business strategy includes growth through
    acquisitions. Future acquisitions may not be completed on
    acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not
    be successfully integrated into our operations. Any acquisitions
    or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly
    encountered in acquisitions of businesses. Such risks include,
    among other things:

•

failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and
    policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired
    companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls,
    procedures and policies;

•

paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or
    assets;



•

failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the
    acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner;

•

assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company;

•

managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business;

•

distracting management focus from our core businesses;

•

difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses;

•

impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic
    partners;

•

incurring expenses associated with the amortization of
    intangible assets;

•

incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a
    portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes
    in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive
    markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize
    expected benefits; and

•

diluting the share value and voting power of existing
    stockholders.

The anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not
    materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in
    the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization
    expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets,
    any of which could harm our financial condition.

We typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities.
    Although we have capacity under our uncommitted facilities,
    lenders are not required to loan us any funds under such
    facilities. Therefore, future acquisitions may require us to
    obtain additional financing, which may not be available on
    favorable terms or at all.

To the
    extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive
    information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may
    decrease.

Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information
    have become increasingly available recently, particularly
    through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue.
    Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of
    information to which they provide free public access. Public
    sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce
    demand for our solutions. To the extent that customers choose
    not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information
    obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our
    business and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Our
    senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and
    the loss of such personnel could harm our
    business.

Our future success substantially depends on the continued
    service and performance of the members of our senior leadership
    team. These personnel possess business and technical
    capabilities that are difficult to replace. Members of our
    senior management operating team have been with us for an
    average of almost twenty years. However, with the exception of
    Frank J. Coyne, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, we do
    not have employee contracts with the members of our senior
    management operating team. If we lose key members of our senior
    management operating team, we may not be able to effectively
    manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future
    business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect
    on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may
    fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support
    our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our
    ability to expand our business and service our
    customers.

Our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and
    our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain
    a sufficient number of qualified employees. If our attrition
    rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may
    decrease. We compete for employees not only with other companies
    in our industry but also with companies in other industries,
    such as software services, engineering services and



financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of
    employees who have the skills and training needed to do our
    work. If our business continues to grow, the number of people we
    will need to hire will increase. We will also need to increase
    our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate
    through our current recruiting and retention policies. Increased
    competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our
    ability to expand our business and service our customers, as
    well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and
    training costs.

We are
    subject to antitrust and other litigation, and may in the future
    become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in
    such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, revenues and profitability.

We participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related
    businesses and services) that are subject to substantial
    litigation, including antitrust litigation. We are subject to
    the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust
    lawsuit brought by various state Attorneys General and private
    plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to
    insurer involvement in our governance and business. We currently
    are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it
    is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have
    conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of
    insurance claims. See “Item 3. Legal
    Proceedings.” Our failure to successfully defend or settle
    such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent
    not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability.
    Given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar
    litigation in the future. Even if the direct financial impact of
    such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments
    arising out of such litigation could include further
    restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including
    potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which
    could increase our cost of doing business and limit our
    prospects for future growth.

Our
    liquidity, financial position and profitability could be
    adversely affected by further deterioration in U.S. and
    international credit markets and economic
    conditions.

Deterioration in the global capital markets has caused financial
    institutions to seek additional capital, merge with larger
    financial institutions and, in some cases, fail. These
    conditions have led to concerns by market participants about the
    stability of financial markets generally and the strength of
    counterparties, resulting in a contraction of available credit,
    even for the most credit-worthy borrowers. Due to recent market
    events, our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be
    negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our revolving
    credit facilities or existing shelf arrangements fails to meet
    its funding obligations. In such an event, we may not be able to
    draw on all, or a substantial portion, of our uncommitted credit
    facilities, which would adversely affect our liquidity. Also, if
    we attempt to obtain future financing in addition to, or
    replacement of, our existing credit facilities to finance our
    continued growth through acquisitions or otherwise, the credit
    market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain
    such financing.

General
    economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond
    our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our
    business.

The demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and
    international factors that are beyond our control, including
    macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability
    of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and
    volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and
    inflation. The United States economy recently experienced
    periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global
    economic environments may continue to be less favorable than
    those of prior years. Any one or more of these factors may
    contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities
    markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for
    our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results
    of operations and financial condition. A significant additional
    decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in
    market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand
    for our solutions. In addition, the decline of the credit
    markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators, and
    therefore, the immediate demand for our related mortgage
    solutions. Specifically, certain of our fraud identification and
    detection solutions are directed at the mortgage market. This
    decline in asset value and originations and an increase in
    foreclosure



levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage
    originations and securitizations. Any new regulatory regime may
    change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and
    other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related
    derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our
    solutions to new regulation.

If
    there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price
    could decline.

The market price of our common stock could decline as a result
    of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the
    market, or the perception that these sales could occur. These
    sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might
    make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the
    future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive.

As of December 31, 2010, our stockholders, who owned our
    shares prior to the IPO and follow-on offering, continue to
    beneficially own in the aggregate approximately
    24,577,690 shares of our Class A common stock,
    primarily owned by our ESOP, 12,225,480 shares of our
    Class B (Series 1), or

Class B-1,

common stock and 14,771,340 shares of our Class B
    (Series 2), or

Class B-2,

common stock, representing in aggregate approximately 30.33% of
    our outstanding common stock. Such stockholders will be able to
    sell their common stock in the public market from time to time
    without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing,
    amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. If
    any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their
    common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline
    significantly. In addition, the perception in the public markets
    that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the
    market price of our common stock.

Certain members of our management are subject to

lock-up

agreements with us whereby they are not be permitted to sell any
    of their common stock, subject to certain conditions, for a
    period of time. Restrictions under these

lock-up

agreements expire in part on April 6, 2011 and expire
    completely on October 6, 2011. Also, pursuant to our
    amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our
    Class B stockholders are not able to sell any of their
    common stock, subject to certain conditions, to the public for a
    period of time. Each share of

Class B-1

common stock shall convert automatically, without any action by
    the holder, into one share of Class A common stock on
    April 6, 2011. Each share of

Class B-2

common stock shall convert automatically, without any action by
    the holder, into one share of Class A common stock on
    October 6, 2011.

Our board of directors may approve exceptions to the limitation
    on transfers of our Class B common stock in their sole
    discretion, in connection with the sale of such Class B
    common stock in a public offering registered with the Securities
    and Exchange Commission or in such other limited circumstances
    as our board of directors may determine. Any Class B common
    stock sold to the public will first be converted to Class A
    common stock. Such further resale of our common stock could
    cause the price of our common stock to decline.

Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase
    approximately 23,018,745 shares of Class A common
    stock were outstanding as of February 25, 2011. We filed a
    registration statement under the Securities Act, which covers
    the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive
    plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares
    held for resale by our existing stockholders that were
    previously issued under our equity incentive plans. Such further
    issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of
    our common stock to decline.

Also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection
    with investments and acquisitions. The amount of our common
    stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition
    could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding
    common stock.

The
    holders of our Class B common stock have the right to elect
    up to three out of eleven of our directors and their interests
    in our business may be different than yours.

Until no Class B common stock remains outstanding, the
    holders of our Class B common stock will have the right to
    elect up to three of our directors. Stockholders of the
    Class B common stock may not have the same incentive to
    approve a corporate action that may be favorable for the holders
    of Class A common



stock, or their interests may otherwise conflict with those of
    Class A stockholders. For example, holders of our
    Class B common stock may seek to cause us to take courses
    of action that, in their judgment, could enhance their
    investment in us or the use of our solutions, but which might
    involve risks to holders of our Class A common stock,
    including a potential decrease in the price of our Class A
    common stock.

Our
    capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of
    anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law and in our amended
    and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could
    diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger,
    tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an
    attempt to replace or remove our directors.

We are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions
    of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or
    prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a
    business combination with an interested stockholder for a period
    of three years after the person becomes an interested
    stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to
    our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of
    incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a
    change in our management or control over us that stockholders
    may consider favorable or make it more difficult for
    stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider
    it beneficial to do so. Our certificate of incorporation and
    bylaws:

•

authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred
    stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase
    the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt;

•

prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which
    would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the
    stock to elect some directors;

•

require that vacancies on the board of directors, including
    newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote
    of directors then in office;

•

limit who may call special meetings of stockholders;

•

authorize the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of
    common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval,
    subject to the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Global Select
    Market;

•

prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all
    stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the
    stockholders; and

•

establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates
    for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters
    that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us.
    As a public company, we are subject to Section 203, which
    regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a
    holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of
    our stock. Under Delaware law a corporation may opt out of the
    anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so.

These provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the
    benefit from any premium over the market price of our common
    stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the
    absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a
    takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the
    prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed
    as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of
    matters in the ordinary course of business, including those
    matters described below. We are unable, at the present time, to
    determine the ultimate resolution of or provide a reasonable
    estimate of the range of possible loss attributable to these
    matters or the impact they may have on our results of
    operations, financial position or cash flows. This is primarily
    because many of these cases remain in their early stages and
    only limited discovery has taken place. Although we believe we
    have strong defenses and intend to vigorously defend the
    litigation proceedings described below, we could in the future
    incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
    financial position or cash flows.

Claims
    Outcome Advisor Litigation

Hensley, et al. v. Computer Sciences Corporation et al.

was a putative nationwide class action complaint, filed in
    February 2005, in Miller County, Arkansas state court.
    Defendants include numerous insurance companies and providers of
    software products used by insurers in paying claims. We are
    among the named defendants. Plaintiffs allege that certain
    software products, including our Claims Outcome Advisor product
    and a competing software product sold by Computer Sciences
    Corporation, improperly estimated the amount to be paid by
    insurers to their policyholders in connection with claims for
    bodily injuries.

We entered into settlement agreements with plaintiffs asserting
    claims relating to the use of Claims Outcome Advisor by
    defendants Hanover Insurance Group, Progressive Car Insurance
    and Liberty Mutual Insurance Group. Each of these settlements
    was granted final approval by the court and together the
    settlements resolve the claims asserted in this case against us
    with respect to the above insurance companies, who settled the
    claims against them as well. A provision was made in 2006 for
    this proceeding and the total amount we paid in 2008 with
    respect to these settlements was less than $2.0 million. A
    fourth defendant, The Automobile Club of California, which is
    alleged to have used Claims Outcome Advisor, was dismissed from
    the action. On August 18, 2008, pursuant to the agreement
    of the parties the Court ordered that the claims against us be
    dismissed with prejudice.

Subsequently, Hanover Insurance Group made a demand for
    reimbursement, pursuant to an indemnification provision
    contained in a December 30, 2004 License Agreement between
    Hanover and the Company, of its settlement and defense costs in
    the

Hensley

class action. Specifically, Hanover demanded
    $2.5 million including $0.6 million in attorneys’
    fees and expenses. We dispute that Hanover is entitled to any
    reimbursement pursuant to the License Agreement. In July 2010,
    the Company and Hanover were unable to



resolve the dispute in mediation, Hanover served a summons and
    complaint seeking indemnity and contribution from us. At this
    time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of
    or estimate the liability related to this matter.

Xactware
    Litigation

The following two lawsuits have been filed by or on behalf of
    groups of Louisiana insurance policyholders who claim, among
    other things, that certain insurers who used products and price
    information supplied by our Xactware subsidiary (and those of
    another provider) did not fully compensate policyholders for
    property damage covered under their insurance policies. The
    plaintiffs seek to recover compensation for their damages in an
    amount equal to the difference between the amount paid by the
    defendants and the fair market repair/restoration costs of their
    damaged property.

Schafer v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co.

,

et al.

was a putative class action pending against us and
    State Farm Fire & Casualty Company filed in March 2007
    in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The complaint alleged
    antitrust violations, breach of contract, negligence, bad faith,
    and fraud. The court dismissed the antitrust claim as to both
    defendants and dismissed all claims against us other than fraud,
    which will proceed to the discovery phase along with the
    remaining claims against State Farm. Judge Duval denied
    plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class with respect to the
    fraud and breach of contract claims on August 3, 2009 and
    the time to appeal that decision has expired. The matter now a
    single action was reassigned to Judge Africk. The plaintiffs
    agreed to settle the matter with the Company and State Farm and
    a Settlement Agreement and a Release was executed by all parties
    in June 2010.

Mornay v. Travelers Ins. Co.

,

et al.

is a
    putative class action pending against us and Travelers Insurance
    Company filed in November 2007 in the Eastern District of
    Louisiana. The complaint alleged antitrust violations, breach of
    contract, negligence, bad faith, and fraud. As in Schafer, the
    court dismissed the antitrust claim as to both defendants and
    dismissed all claims against us other than fraud. Judge Duval
    stayed all proceedings in the case pending an appraisal of the
    lead plaintiff’s insurance claim. The matter has been
    re-assigned to Judge Barbier, who on September 11, 2009
    issued an order administratively closing the matter pending
    completion of the appraisal process. At this time, it is not
    possible to determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate the
    liability related to this matter.

iiX
    Litigation

In March 2007, our subsidiary, Insurance Information Exchange,
    or iiX, as well as other information providers and insurers in
    the State of Texas, were served with a summons and class action
    complaint filed in the United States District Court for the
    Eastern District of Texas alleging violations of the Driver
    Privacy Protection Act, or the DPPA, entitled

Sharon Taylor,
    et al. v. Acxiom Corporation, et al

. Plaintiffs brought
    the action on their own behalf and on behalf of all similarly
    situated individuals whose personal information is contained in
    any motor vehicle record maintained by the State of Texas and
    who have not provided express consent to the State of Texas for
    the distribution of their personal information for purposes not
    enumerated by the DPPA and whose personal information has been
    knowingly obtained and used by the defendants. The class
    complaint alleges that the defendants knowingly obtained
    personal information for a purpose not authorized by the DPPA
    and seeks liquidated damages in the amount of two thousand five
    hundred dollars for each instance of a violation of the DPPA,
    punitive damages and the destruction of any illegally obtained
    personal information. The Court granted iiX’s motion to
    dismiss the complaint based on failure to state a claim and for
    lack of standing. Oral arguments on the plaintiffs’ appeal
    of that dismissal were held on November 4, 2009. The Court
    of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Court affirmed the District
    Court’s dismissal of the complaint on July 14, 2010.
    Plaintiffs filed a petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the
    United States Supreme Court on October 12, 2010, which was
    denied on January 10, 2011.

Similarly, in April 2010, our subsidiary, iiX, as well as other
    information providers in the State of Missouri were served with
    a summons and class action complaint filed in the United States
    District Court for the Western District of Missouri alleging
    violations of the DPPA entitled

Janice Cook, et al. v.
    ACS State & Local Solutions, et al.

Plaintiffs
    brought the action on their own behalf and on behalf of all
    similarly situated



individuals whose personal information is contained in any motor
    vehicle record maintained by the State of Missouri and who have
    not provided express consent to the State of Missouri for the
    distribution of their personal information for purposes not
    enumerated by the DPPA and whose personal information has been
    knowingly obtained and used by the defendants. The class
    complaint alleges that the defendants knowingly obtained
    personal information for a purpose not authorized by the DPPA
    and seeks liquidated damages in the amount of two thousand five
    hundred dollars for each instance of a violation of the DDPA,
    punitive damages and the destruction of any illegally obtained
    personal information. The court granted iiX’s motion to
    dismiss the complaint based on a failure to state a claim on
    November 19, 2010. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on
    December 17, 2010. At this time, it is not possible to
    determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate the liability
    related to these matters.

Interthinx
    Litigation

In September 2009, our subsidiary, Interthinx, Inc., or
    Interthinx, was served with a putative class action entitled

Renata Gluzman v. Interthinx, Inc.

The plaintiff, a
    former Interthinx employee, filed the class action on
    August 13, 2009 in the Superior Court of the State of
    California, County of Los Angeles on behalf of all Interthinx
    information technology employees for unpaid overtime and missed
    meals and rest breaks, as well as various related claims
    claiming that the information technology employees were
    misclassified as exempt employees and, as a result, were denied
    certain wages and benefits that would have been received if they
    were properly classified as non-exempt employees. The pleadings
    include, among other things, a violation of Business and
    Professions Code 17200 for unfair business practices, which
    allows plaintiffs to include as class members all information
    technology employees employed at Interthinx for four years prior
    to the date of filing the complaint. The complaint seeks
    compensatory damages, penalties that are associated with the
    various statutes, restitution, interest costs, and attorney
    fees. On June 2, 2010, plaintiffs agreed to settle their
    claims with Interthinx. The court granted preliminary approval
    to the settlement on November 10, 2010 and scheduled the
    final approval hearing for February 23, 2011. Although no
    assurance can be given concerning the outcome of this matter, in
    the opinion of management the lawsuit is not expected to have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

    Information

Verisk trades under the ticker symbol “VRSK” on the
    NASDAQ Global Select Market. Our common stock was first publicly
    traded on October 7, 2009. As of February 25, 2011,
    the closing price of our Class A common stock was $32.49
    per share, as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market. There
    is no established public trading market for our Class B
    common stock. As of February 25, 2011 there were
    approximately 17 Class A and 39 Class B stockholders
    of record. We believe the number of beneficial owners is
    substantially greater than the number of record holders for
    Class A common stock, because a large portion of
    Class A common stock is held in “street name” by
    brokers.

We have not paid or declared any cash dividends on our
    Class A,

Class B-1,

or

Class B-2

common stock during the two most recent fiscal years and we
    currently do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A,

Class B-1,

or

Class B-2

common stock. We do have a publicly announced share repurchase
    plan and have repurchased 15,069,452 shares since our IPO.
    As of December 31, 2010, we had 372,107,352 shares of
    treasury stock.



The following table shows the quarterly range of the closing

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with
    our historical financial statements and the related notes
    included elsewhere in this annual report on

Form 10-K,

as well as the discussion under “Selected Consolidated
    Financial Data.” This discussion contains forward-looking
    statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual
    results may differ materially from those discussed in or implied
    by any of the forward-looking statements as a result of various
    factors, including but not limited to those listed under
    “Risk Factors” and “Special Note Regarding
    Forward-Looking Statements.”

We enable risk-bearing businesses to better understand and
    manage their risks. We provide value to our customers by
    supplying proprietary data that, combined with our analytic
    methods, creates embedded decision support solutions. We are the
    largest aggregator and provider of data pertaining to
    U.S. property and casualty, or P&C, insurance risks.
    We offer solutions for detecting fraud in the U.S. P&C
    insurance, mortgage and healthcare industries and sophisticated
    methods to predict and quantify loss in diverse contexts ranging
    from natural catastrophes to health insurance.

Our customers use our solutions to make better risk decisions
    with greater efficiency and discipline. We refer to these
    products and services as ‘solutions’ due to the
    integration among our products and the flexibility that enables
    our customers to purchase components or the comprehensive
    package of products. These solutions take various forms,
    including data, statistical models or tailored analytics, all
    designed to allow our clients to make more logical decisions. We
    believe our solutions for analyzing risk positively impact our
    customers’ revenues and help them better manage their costs.

On May 23, 2008, in contemplation of our IPO, Insurance
    Service Office, Inc., or ISO, formed Verisk Analytics, Inc., or
    Verisk, a Delaware corporation, to be the holding company for
    our business. Verisk was initially formed as a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of ISO. On October 6, 2009 in connection with
    our IPO, we effected a reorganization whereby ISO became a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Verisk. We did not receive any
    proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering.

On October 1, 2010, we completed a follow-on public
    offering of 21,885,092 shares of Class A common stock
    sold by selling stockholders. We did not receive any proceeds
    from the sale of common stock in the offering. The primary
    purpose of the offering was to manage and organize the sale by
    Class B insurance company shareholders while providing
    incremental public float. Concurrently with the closing of the
    follow-on public offering, we repurchased 7.3 million
    shares of Class B common stock, for an aggregate purchase
    price of $192.5 million.

We organize our business in two segments: Risk Assessment and
    Decision Analytics. Our Risk Assessment segment provides
    statistical, actuarial and underwriting data for the
    U.S. P&C insurance industry.



Our Risk Assessment segment revenues represented approximately
    47.6% and 51.0% of our revenues for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our Decision
    Analytics segment provides solutions our customers use to
    analyze the processes of the Verisk Risk Analysis Framework:
    Loss Prediction, Fraud Identification and Detection, and Loss
    Quantification. Our Decision Analytics segment revenues
    represented approximately 52.4% and 49.0% of our revenues for
    the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Executive
    Summary

Key
    Performance Metrics

We believe our business’s ability to generate recurring
    revenue and positive cash flow is the key indicator of the
    successful execution of our business strategy. We use year over
    year revenue growth and EBITDA margin as metrics to measure our
    performance. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial
    measures, see Note 4 within Item 6. Selected Financial
    Data included in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Revenue growth.

We use year over year revenue
    growth as a key performance metric. We assess revenue growth
    based on our ability to generate increased revenue through
    increased sales to existing customers, sales to new customers,
    sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new customers
    and strategic acquisitions of new businesses.

EBITDA margin.

We use EBITDA margin as a
    metric to assess segment performance and scalability of our
    business. We assess EBITDA margin based on our ability to
    increase revenues while controlling expense growth.

Revenues

We earn revenues through subscriptions, long-term agreements and
    on a transactional basis. Subscriptions for our solutions are
    generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly
    or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which
    is usually for one year and automatically renewed each year. As
    a result, the timing of our cash flows generally precedes our
    recognition of revenues and income and our cash flow from
    operations tends to be higher in the first quarter as we receive
    subscription payments. Examples of these arrangements include
    subscriptions that allow our customers to access our
    standardized coverage language, our claims fraud solution or our
    actuarial services throughout the subscription period. In
    general, we experience minimal revenue seasonality within the
    business. Our long-term agreements are generally for periods of
    three to seven years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions
    ratably over the term of the subscription and most long-term
    agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.

Certain of our solutions are also paid for by our customers on a
    transactional basis. For example, we have solutions that allow
    our customers to access fraud detection tools in the context of
    an individual mortgage application or loan, obtain
    property-specific rating and underwriting information to price a
    policy on a commercial building, or compare a P&C
    insurance, medical or workers’ compensation claim with
    information in our databases. For the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, 30.2% and 29.0% of our
    revenues, respectively, were derived from providing
    transactional solutions. We earn transactional revenues as our
    solutions are delivered or services performed. In general,
    transactions are billed monthly at the end of each month.

Approximately 84.0% and 83.8% of the revenues in our Risk
    Assessment segment for the years ended December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively, were derived from subscriptions and
    long-term agreements for our solutions. Our customers in this
    segment include most of the P&C insurance providers in the
    United States. Approximately 56.8% and 57.7% of the revenues in
    our Decision Analytics segment, for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were derived from
    subscriptions and long-term agreements for our solutions.



Principal
    Operating Costs and Expenses

Personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of
    revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses.
    Personnel expenses include salaries, benefits, incentive
    compensation, equity compensation costs (described under
    “Equity Compensation Costs” below), sales commissions,
    employment taxes, recruiting costs, and outsourced temporary
    agency costs, which represented 65.4% and 67.6% of our total
    expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The higher percentage of personnel expenses in
    2009 is primarily related to the accelerated ESOP allocation
    that occurred prior to our initial IPO. The accelerated ESOP
    allocation resulted in a one time, non-cash charge of
    $57.7 million. Excluding this accelerated ESOP allocation,
    personnel expenses represented 64.8% of our total expenses for
    the year ended December 31, 2009.

We allocate personnel expenses between two categories, cost of
    revenues and selling, general and administrative costs, based on
    the actual costs associated with each employee. We categorize
    employees who maintain our solutions as cost of revenues, and
    all other personnel, including executive managers, sales people,
    marketing, business development, finance, legal, human
    resources, and administrative services, as selling, general and
    administrative expenses. A significant portion of our other
    operating costs, such as facilities and communications, are also
    either captured within cost of revenues or selling, general and
    administrative expense based on the nature of the work being
    performed.

While we expect to grow our headcount over time to take
    advantage of our market opportunities, we believe that the
    economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow
    our personnel expenses at a lower rate than revenues.
    Historically, our EBITDA margin has improved because we have
    been able to increase revenues without a proportionate
    corresponding increase in expenses.

Cost of Revenues.

Our cost of revenues
    consists primarily of personnel expenses. Cost of revenues also
    includes the expenses associated with the acquisition and
    verification of data, the maintenance of our existing solutions
    and the development and enhancement of our next-generation
    solutions. Our cost of revenues excludes depreciation and
    amortization.

Selling, General and Administrative
    Expense.

Our selling, general and administrative
    expense also consists primarily of personnel costs. A portion of
    the other operating costs such as facilities, insurance and
    communications are also allocated to selling, general and
    administrative costs based on the nature of the work being
    performed by the employee. Our selling, general and
    administrative expenses excludes depreciation and amortization.

Description
    of Acquisitions

We have acquired six businesses since January 1, 2009. As a
    result of these acquisitions, our consolidated results of
    operations may not be comparable between periods. The
    acquisitions noted below are all integrated within our Decision
    Analytics segment.

On December 16, 2010, we acquired 100% of the common stock
    of 3E Company, or 3E, a global source for a comprehensive suite
    of environmental health and safety compliance solutions for a
    net cash purchase price of approximately $107.3 million, of
    which $7.7 million was used to fund indemnity escrows. We
    are still evaluating the allocation of purchase price. Within
    our Decision Analytics segment, 3E overlaps the customer sets
    served by our other supply chain risk management solutions and
    helps our customers across a variety of vertical markets address
    their environmental health and safety issues. See Note 10
    to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual
    report on

Form 10-K

for the preliminary purchase allocation.

On December 14, 2010, we acquired 100% of the common stock
    of Crowe Paradis Services Corporation, or CP, a leading provider
    of claims analysis and compliance solutions for the
    property/casualty insurance industry, for a net cash purchase
    price of approximately $90.3 million, of which
    $6.8 million was used to fund indemnity escrows. We are
    still evaluating the allocation of purchase price. Within our
    Decision Analytics segment, CP offers solutions for complying
    with the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) Act, provides services
    to many of the largest worker’s compensation insurers,
    third-party administrators (TPAs),



and self-insured companies which enhances solutions we currently
    offer. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements
    included in this annual report on

Form 10-K

for the preliminary purchase allocation.

On February 26, 2010, we acquired 100% of the common stock
    of Strategic Analytics, Inc., or SA, a privately owned provider
    of credit risk and capital management solutions to consumer and
    mortgage lenders, for a net cash purchase price of
    $7.9 million of which $1.5 million was used to fund
    indemnity escrows. Within our Decision Analytics segment,
    SA’s solutions and application set will allow our customers
    to take advantage of

state-of-the-art

loss forecasting, stress testing, and economic capital
    requirement tools to better understand and forecast the risk
    associated within their credit portfolios. See Note 10 to
    our consolidated financial statements included in this annual
    report on

Form 10-K

for the purchase allocation.

On October 30, 2009, we acquired the net assets of Enabl-u
    Technology Corporation, Inc, or Enabl-u, a privately owned
    provider of data management, training and communication
    solutions to companies with regional, national or global work
    forces. We believe this acquisition will enhance our ability to
    provide solutions for customers to measure loss prevention and
    improve asset management through the use of software and
    software services.

On July 24, 2009, we acquired the net assets of TierMed
    Systems, LLC, or TierMed, a privately owned provider of
    Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, or HEDIS,
    solutions to healthcare organizations that have HEDIS or
    quality-reporting needs. We believe this acquisition will
    enhance our ability to provide solutions for customers to
    measure and improve healthcare quality and financial performance
    through the use of software and software services.

On January 14, 2009, we acquired 100% of the stock of D2
    Hawkeye, Inc., or D2, a privately-owned provider of data mining,
    decision support, clinical quality analysis, and risk analysis
    tools for the healthcare industry. We believe this acquisition
    will enhance our position in the healthcare analytics and
    predictive modeling market by providing new market, cross-sell,
    and diversification opportunities for the Company’s
    expanding healthcare solutions.

Equity
    Compensation Costs

We have a leveraged ESOP, funded with intercompany debt that
    includes 401(k), ESOP and profit sharing components to provide
    employees with equity participation. We make quarterly cash
    contributions to the plan equal to the debt service
    requirements. As the debt is repaid, shares are released to the
    ESOP to fund 401(k) matching and profit sharing
    contributions and the remainder is allocated annually to active
    employees in proportion to their eligible compensation in
    relation to total participants’ eligible compensation.

We accrue compensation expense over the reporting period equal
    to the fair value of the shares to be released to the ESOP.
    Depending on the number of shares released to the plan during
    the quarter and the fluctuation in the fair value of the shares,
    a corresponding increase or decrease in compensation expense
    will



occur. The amount of our equity compensation costs recognized
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as
    follows:

In connection with our IPO, on October 6, 2009, we
    accelerated our future ESOP allocation contribution through the
    end of the ESOP in 2013, to all participants eligible for a
    contribution in 2009. This resulted in a non-recurring non-cash
    charge of approximately $57.7 million in the fourth quarter
    of 2009. As a result, subsequent to the offering, the non-cash
    ESOP allocation expense was substantially reduced for future
    periods. Excluding the ESOP allocation, expense relating
    specifically to our 401(k) and profit sharing plans were
    $11.6 million, $8.7 million and $9.7 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

In addition, the portion of the ESOP allocation expense related
    to the appreciation of the value of the shares in the ESOP above
    the value of those shares when the ESOP was first established is
    not tax deductible.

Prior to our IPO, we granted to key employees nonqualified stock
    options covered under the Insurance Services Office, Inc. 1996
    Incentive Plan, or the Option Plan. Subsequent to the IPO,
    nonqualified stock options granted to key employees are covered
    under the Verisk Analytics, Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, the
    Incentive Plan. All of the Company’s outstanding stock
    options are covered under the Incentive Plan or the Option Plan.
    See

Stock-Based Compensation

section within our Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 16 in our
    consolidated financial statements included in this annual report
    on

Form 10-K.

Prior to our IPO, our Class A stock and vested stock
    options were recorded within redeemable common stock at full
    redemption value at each balance sheet date, as the redemption
    of these securities was not solely within the control of the
    Company. Effective with the corporate reorganization that
    occurred on October 6, 2009, we are no longer obligated to
    redeem Class A stock and therefore are not required to
    present our Class A stock and vested stock options at
    redemption value. Our financial results for the fourth quarter
    of 2009 reflect a reversal of the redeemable common stock. The
    reversal of the redeemable common stock of $1,064.9 million
    on October 6, 2009 resulted in the elimination of
    accumulated deficit of $440.6 million, an increase of
    $0.1 million to Class A common stock at par value, an
    increase of $624.3 million to additional

paid-in-capital,

and a reclassification of the ISO Class A unearned common
    stock shares balance within the ISO 401(k) Savings and Employee
    Stock Ownership Plan, or KSOP, of $1.3 million to unearned
    KSOP contributions. See Note 14 in our consolidated
    financial statements included in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Public
    Company Expenses

Beginning in 2008, our selling, general and administrative costs
    increased as we prepared for our IPO. These costs were
    $7.0 million and $6.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 and negatively affected our
    EBITDA margins by 0.7% for each of the year ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. Following our IPO, we incurred
    additional selling, general and administrative expenses related
    to operating as a public company, such as increased legal and
    accounting expenses, the cost of an investor relations function,



costs related to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002, and increased director and officer insurance premiums.

Results
    of Operations

Year
    Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2009

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Revenues

Revenues were $1,138.3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to $1,027.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of
    $111.2 million or 10.8%. In 2010 and the latter half of
    2009, we acquired five companies, TierMed, Enabl-u, Strategic
    Analytics, CP, and 3E, collectively referred to as recent
    acquisitions, which we define as acquisitions not owned for a
    significant portion of both the current period

and/or

prior
    period and would therefore impact the comparability of the
    financial results. Recent acquisitions provided an increase of
    $10.5 million in revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. Excluding recent acquisitions, revenues
    increased $100.7 million, which included an increase in our
    Risk Assessment segment of $18.1 million and an increase in
    our Decision Analytics segment of $82.6 million. Refer to
    the Results of Operations by Segment within this section for
    further information regarding our revenues.

Cost of
    Revenues

Cost of revenues was $463.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to $491.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of
    $27.8 million or 5.7%. This decrease was primarily due to
    the accelerated ESOP allocation that occurred in 2009, which
    resulted in the elimination of substantially all future ESOP
    allocation expense. In 2010 and 2009, our ESOP allocation
    expense for the year was $0.0 million and
    $51.9 million, respectively. The reduction in our cost of
    revenues was offset by recent acquisitions, which provided an
    increase of $6.4 million in cost for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of the accelerated
    ESOP allocation in 2009 and the cost associated with our recent
    acquisitions, our cost of revenues increased $17.7 million
    or 4.0%. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries
    and employee benefits cost of $16.9 million;
    $4.1 million of data and consultants costs incurred in
    connection with the growth in our

property-specific

rating and underwriting information, and fraud identification
    and detection solutions; and other general expenses of
    $0.3 million. These increases in costs were partially
    offset by a $2.7 million increase in state employment tax
    credit and a reduction in office maintenance expense of
    $0.9 million.

The increase in salaries and employee benefits of
    $16.9 million includes an increase of $24.6 million in
    annual salaries and employee benefits such as medical costs and
    long-term incentive plan, and was partially offset by a decrease
    of $7.7 million in pension costs. The increase in salaries
    and benefit costs is related to a modest increase in employee
    headcount, primarily in Decision Analytics. The pension cost
    decreased $7.7 million primarily due to the partial
    recovery in 2009 of the fair value of our pension investments.

Selling,
    General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SGA, were
    $166.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to $162.6 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, an increase of $3.8 million or
    2.3%. Excluding the impact of the accelerated ESOP allocation in
    2009 of $15.4 million and costs associated with our recent
    acquisitions of $4.8 million, SGA increased
    $14.4 million or 9.8%. The increase was primarily due to an
    increase in salaries and employee benefits of
    $14.4 million, which includes annual salary increases,
    medical costs, commissions, and long-term incentive plan. Other
    increases were costs related to advertising and marketing of
    $2.5 million and other general expenses of
    $2.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a
    decrease in legal costs primarily related to our IPO in 2009 of
    $2.8 million and a reduction in pension cost of
    $1.8 million.



Depreciation
    and Amortization of Fixed Assets

Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was
    $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to $38.6 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, an increase of $2.1 million or
    5.6%. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets includes
    depreciation of furniture and equipment, software, computer
    hardware, and related equipment. The majority of the increase
    relates to software and hardware costs to support data capacity
    expansion and revenue growth.

Amortization
    of Intangible Assets

Amortization of intangible assets was $27.4 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $32.6 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of
    $5.2 million or 16.0%. This decrease was primarily related
    to a decrease of $6.3 million of amortization of intangible
    assets associated with prior acquisitions that have been fully
    amortized; partially offset by $1.1 million of amortization
    of intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions.

Acquisition
    Related Liabilities Adjustment

Acquisition related liabilities adjustment was a benefit of
    $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010;
    there was no such adjustment in 2009. This benefit was as a
    result of a reduction of $0.5 million to contingent
    consideration due to the reduced probability of TierMed, a
    recent acquisition, achieving the EBITDA and revenue earnout
    targets set at the time of the acquisition.

Investment
    Income and Realized Gains/(Losses) on Securities, Net

Investment income and realized gains/(losses) on securities,
    net, was a gain of $0.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 as compared to a loss of
    $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an
    increase of $2.5 million.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $34.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to $35.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of
    $0.6 million or 1.7%. This decrease was primarily due to
    reduced interest costs as a result of a decrease in average debt
    outstanding of approximately $605 million in 2010 compared
    to approximately $650 million in 2009, coupled with a
    decrease in our interest rate on borrowings from our syndicated
    revolving credit facility from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus
    1.75%. The decrease in borrowing rate was the result of an
    amendment to the facility on September 10, 2010. These
    reductions were partially offset by an increase in the
    amortization of debt issuance costs related to the syndicated
    credit facility, which had been entered into in July of 2009.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $164.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 compared to
    $138.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    an increase of $26.1 million or 18.9%. The effective tax
    rate was 40.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The
    effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 was
    lower due to a decrease in nondeductible expenses in 2010 versus
    2009 related to the KSOP.

EBITDA
    Margin

The EBITDA margin for our consolidated results was 44.7% for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 36.3% for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. Our EBITDA margin does not reflect
    any ESOP allocation expense in 2010 due to the accelerated ESOP
    allocation that occurred in 2009. The ESOP allocation expense of
    $67.3 million in 2009 negatively impacted our 2009 EBITDA
    margin by approximately 6.6%. Also included in the calculation
    of our 2009 EBITDA margin are costs of $7.0 million
    associated with the preparation of our IPO for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, which also negatively impacted our
    margin by



0.7%. For our 2010 EBITDA margin, a decrease in pension costs of
    $9.5 million positively impacted our margin by
    approximately 0.8%.

    of Operations by Segment

Risk
    Assessment

Revenues

Revenues were $542.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 as compared to $524.0 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of
    $18.1 million or 3.5%. The overall increase within this
    segment primarily resulted from an increase in prices derived
    from continued enhancements to the content of our
    industry-standard insurance programs’ solutions and the
    addition of new customers. The increase of $5.0 million or
    3.8% within property-specific rating and underwriting
    information revenues is due partially to growth in property
    appraisal solutions and community rating services.

Cost of
    Revenues

Cost of revenues for our Risk Assessment segment was
    $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to $230.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, a decrease of $35.8 million or
    15.5%. Excluding the impact of the accelerated ESOP allocation
    in 2009 of $29.7 million, our cost of revenues decreased by
    $6.1 million or 3.0%. This decrease was primarily due to
    decrease in salaries and employee benefits costs of
    $3.1 million, a $2.2 million increase in state
    employment tax credit, office maintenance expense of
    $1.1 million and $0.7 million of other general
    expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase
    in data and consultant costs of $1.0 million incurred
    primarily in connection with the revenues from our
    property-specific rating and underwriting information solutions.

The decrease in salaries and employee benefits of
    $3.1 million includes $6.5 million reduction in
    pension costs and was partially offset by an increase of
    $3.4 million in salary and employee benefit costs, which
    include annual salary increases and long-term incentive plans
    across a relatively constant employee headcount.

Selling,
    General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses for our Risk
    Assessment segment were $79.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to $82.5 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of
    $3.5 million or 4.3%. Excluding the impact of the
    accelerated ESOP allocation in 2009 of $8.7 million, SGA
    increased $5.2 million or 7.0%. The increase was primarily
    due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of
    $6.1 million, which includes annual salary increases,
    medical costs, commissions, and long-term incentive plan expense
    and an increase in other general expenses of $1.4 million.
    These increases were partially offset by a decrease in pension
    cost of $1.4 million and decrease in legal costs primarily
    related to our IPO in 2009 of $0.9 million.



EBITDA
    Margin

The EBITDA margin for our Risk Assessment segment was 49.5% for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 40.3% for the
    year ended December 31, 2009. The impact of the accelerated
    ESOP allocation of $38.4 million in 2009 negatively
    affected our margin by approximately 7.3%. In addition, included
    in our 2009 EBITDA margin are costs of $4.0 million
    associated with the preparation of our IPO for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, which negatively impacted our margin of
    0.8%. For our 2010 EBITDA margin, decreased pension costs of
    $7.9 million positively impacted our margin by
    approximately 1.5%.

Decision
    Analytics

Revenues

Revenues for our Decision Analytics segment were
    $596.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to $503.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, an increase of $93.1 million or
    18.5%. Recent acquisitions accounted for an increase of
    $10.5 million in revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. Our fraud identification and detection
    solutions revenue increased $47.7 million or 17.5%.
    Excluding the recent acquisitions, our fraud identification and
    detection solutions revenue increased $42.5 million
    primarily due to an increase in services sold in our fraud
    detection and forensic audit services for the mortgage lenders
    and mortgage insurance industries. Revenue increased in our loss
    prediction solutions of $21.1 million or 15.4%. Excluding
    the recent acquisitions, our loss prediction solutions increased
    $15.8 million primarily due to new customers and increased
    penetration of our existing customers. Our loss quantification
    solution revenues increased $24.3 million or 26.2%, as a
    result of new customer contracts and new solutions.

Cost of
    Revenues

Cost of revenues for our Decision Analytics segment was
    $268.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to $260.8 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, an increase of $8.0 million or
    3.0%. Excluding the impact of the accelerated ESOP allocation in
    2009 of $22.2 million and costs associated with recent
    acquisitions of $6.4 million, our cost of revenues
    increased by $23.8 million or 10.0%. This increase is
    primarily due to an increase in salary and employee benefits of
    $20.0 million; data and consultant costs of
    $3.1 million incurred primarily related to the revenue
    growth in our fraud identification and detection solutions;
    other general expenses of $1.0 million; and office
    maintenance expense of $0.2 million offset by a
    $0.5 million increase in state employment tax credit.

The increase in salaries and employee benefits of
    $20.0 million includes $21.2 million increase in
    salaries and employee benefit costs, medical expense, and
    long-term incentive plans, including the IPO stock option grant;
    and is partially offset by decreases in pension of
    $1.2 million. The increase in salaries and benefit costs is
    related to a modest increase in employee headcount relative to
    the 18.5% revenue growth in our Decision Analytic revenues.



Selling,
    General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses for our Decision
    Analytics segment were $87.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to $80.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of
    $7.3 million or 9.2%. Excluding the impact of the
    accelerated ESOP allocation in 2009 of $6.7 million and
    cost associated with recent acquisitions of $4.8 million,
    SGA increased $9.2 million or 12.5%. The increase was
    primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits
    of $8.3 million, which includes annual salary increases,
    medical costs, commissions, and long-term incentive plan. Other
    increases were costs related to advertising and marketing of
    $2.4 million and an increase in other general expenses of
    $0.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a
    decrease in legal costs primarily related to our IPO of
    $1.9 million and decreased pension cost of
    $0.4 million.

EBITDA
    Margin

The EBITDA margin for our Decision Analytics segment was 40.3%
    for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 32.3% for
    the year ended December 31, 2009. The impact of the
    accelerated ESOP allocation of $28.9 million in 2009
    negatively affected our margin by approximately 5.8%. In
    addition, included in our 2009 EBITDA margin are IPO related
    costs of $3.0 million, which negatively impacted our margin
    by 0.6%.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009 we
    acquired five businesses, which may affect the comparability of
    our financial statements.

Revenues

Revenues were $1,027.1 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to $893.6 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of
    $133.5 million or 14.9%. The acquisitions in the second
    half of 2008 and the three acquisitions in 2009 accounted for an
    increase of $33.2 million in revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Excluding these acquisitions, revenues
    increased $100.3 million, which included an increase in our
    Risk Assessment segment of $19.6 million and an increase in
    our Decision Analytics segment of $80.7 million.

Cost of
    Revenues

Cost of revenues was $491.3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to $386.9 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of
    $104.4 million or 27.0%. The increase was primarily due to
    the accelerated ESOP allocation, which resulted in a
    non-recurring non-cash charge of $44.4 million prior to our
    IPO and costs related to the newly acquired companies of
    $17.7 million. Excluding the accelerated ESOP allocation
    and the effect of the newly acquired companies, our cost of
    revenues increased $42.3 million or 10.9%. The increase was
    primarily due to costs related to an increase in salaries and
    employee benefits costs of $32.2 million, which include
    annual salary increases, medical costs, and pension cost.
    Pension cost represents $15.0 million of the salaries and
    employee benefit costs increase due to the decline in the market
    values of pension investments as a result of the global economic
    downturn in 2008. Other increases include third party data costs
    of $10.5 million primarily in our Decision Analytics
    segment and office maintenance fees of $1.4 million. These
    increases were partially offset by a decrease in other operating
    expenses of $1.8 million, which include travel and auto
    related costs.

Selling,
    General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $162.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to $131.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, an increase of $31.4 million or
    23.9%. The increase was primarily due to the accelerated ESOP
    allocation, which resulted in a non-recurring



non-cash charge of $13.3 million prior to our IPO and costs
    related to the newly acquired companies of $12.7 million.
    Excluding the accelerated ESOP allocation and the effect of the
    newly acquired companies, our selling, general and
    administrative expenses increased $5.4 million or 4.1%. The
    increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and
    employee benefits costs of $10.3 million, which include
    annual salary increases, medical costs, commissions and pension
    costs across a relatively constant employee headcount. Pension
    costs represent $3.1 million of the increases in salaries
    and employee benefit costs due to the decline in the market
    values of pension investments as a result of the global economic
    downturn in 2008. Other increases were attributed to other
    general expenses of $0.9 million. These increases were
    partially offset by a decrease in legal costs of
    $3.8 million and an insurance cost recovery of
    $2.0 million.

Depreciation
    and Amortization of Fixed Assets

Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was
    $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to $35.3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, an increase of $3.3 million or
    9.2%. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets includes
    depreciation of furniture and equipment, software, computer
    hardware, and related equipment.

Amortization
    of Intangible Assets

Amortization of intangible assets was $32.6 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $29.6 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of
    $3.0 million or 10.4%. The increase is the result of the
    amortization of intangibles from our new acquisitions, partially
    offset by certain intangible assets having been fully amortized
    in 2008. We amortize intangible assets obtained through
    acquisitions over the periods that we expect to derive benefit
    from such assets.

Investment
    Income and Realized (Losses)/Gains on Securities, Net

Investment income and realized (losses)/gains on securities, net
    was $(2.1) million for the year ended December 31,
    2009 compared to $(0.3) million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, an increased loss of $1.8 million.
    Investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009
    includes $0.3 million of investment income, partially
    offset by $2.4 million of other-than temporary impairment
    primarily related to a cost basis private equity investment in a
    telematics business. Investment income for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 consisted of $2.2 million of
    investment income, partially offset by a $(2.5) million
    realized loss on sale of securities. The decrease in investment
    income was primarily the result of the termination of the
    shareholder loan program in 2008.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $35.3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to $31.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of
    $4.0 million or 12.6%. This increase is primarily due to an
    increase in the weighted average interest rate on our
    outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31,
    2009.

Provision
    for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes was $138.0 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 compared to
    $120.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    an increase of $17.3 million or 14.4%. The effective tax
    rate was 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to 43.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The
    2009 rate is higher due to the non-recurring, non-cash costs
    associated with the accelerated ESOP allocation and certain IPO
    related costs that are not tax deductible.

EBITDA
    Margin

The EBITDA margin for our consolidated results was 36.3% for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 42.0% for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. Included in the calculation of our
    EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 are
    non-recurring, non-cash costs of $57.7 million associated
    with the



accelerated ESOP allocation prior to our IPO, representing a
    5.6% negative impact in EBITDA margin, and increased pension
    costs of $18.1 million, representing a 1.8% negative impact
    on our EBITDA margin. Also included in the calculation of our
    EBITDA margin are costs of $7.0 million and
    $6.5 million associated with the preparation for our IPO
    for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, which represents a 0.7% negative impact in EBITDA
    margin for each period.

    of Operations by Segment

Risk
    Assessment

Revenues

Revenues for our Risk Assessment segment were
    $524.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to $504.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, an increase of $19.6 million or
    3.9%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the sales
    of our industry-standard insurance programs and
    property-specific rating and underwriting information. The
    increase in our industry-standard insurance programs primarily
    resulted from an increase in prices derived from continued
    enhancements to the content of our solutions and the addition of
    new customers. The increase in our property-specific rating and
    underwriting information is particularly due to sales of our
    rate making and policy administration solutions. Our revenue by

Cost of
    Revenues

Cost of revenues for our Risk Assessment segment was
    $230.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to $199.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, an increase of $30.6 million or
    15.3%. The increase was primarily due to the accelerated ESOP
    allocation, which resulted in a non-recurring non-cash charge of
    $25.4 million prior to our IPO. Excluding the accelerated
    ESOP allocation, our cost of revenues increased
    $5.2 million or 2.6%. The increase was primarily due to an
    increase in salaries and employee benefits costs of
    $10.1 million, primarily related to pension costs of
    $12.7 million resulting from the global economic downturn
    experienced in 2008, partially offset by a decrease in salaries
    due to a slight reduction in headcount. There was also an
    increase in office maintenance fees of $0.3 million. The
    increase was partially offset by a decrease in other operating
    expenses of $3.8 million, which include decreases in travel
    and auto related costs, and a decrease in data and consultant
    costs of $1.4 million.

Selling,
    General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses for our Risk
    Assessment segment were $82.5 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to $81.8 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of
    $0.7 million or 0.9%. Included within the increase in SGA
    is the accelerated ESOP allocation, which resulted in a
    non-recurring non-cash charge of $7.5 million. Excluding
    this accelerated ESOP charge, our SGA decreased
    $6.8 million or 8.2%. The decrease was primarily due to
    lower legal costs of $4.1 million primarily associated with
    the preparation for our IPO in 2008, an insurance cost recovery
    of $1.7 million and other general expenses of
    $1.4 million. These decreases was partially offset by an
    increase in salaries and employee benefit costs of
    $0.4 million, which include increased pension costs of
    $2.4 million offset by a decrease in salaries and other
    employee benefits.



EBITDA
    Margin

The EBITDA margin for our Risk Assessment segment was 40.3% for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 44.2% for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. Included in the calculation
    of our EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    are non-recurring, non-cash costs of $32.9 million
    associated with the accelerated ESOP allocation prior to our
    IPO, representing a 6.3% negative impact in EBITDA margin, and
    increased pension costs of $15.1 million, representing a
    2.8% negative impact on our EBITDA margin. Also included in the
    calculation of our EBITDA margin are costs of $4.1 and
    $5.8 million associated with the preparation for our IPO
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31,
    2008, respectively, representing a 0.8% and 1.1% negative
    impact, respectively, in EBITDA margin for each period.

Decision
    Analytics

Revenues

Revenues for our Decision Analytics segment were
    $503.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to $389.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, an increase of $113.9 million or
    29.3%. In 2008 and 2009, we acquired two companies and three
    companies, respectively. These acquisitions accounted for
    $1.3 million and $34.5 million of additional revenues
    for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009,
    respectively. The increase in revenue relating to the
    acquisitions was $33.2 million, of which $33.1 million
    relates to the loss prediction category and $0.1 million
    relates to the fraud and detection solutions category. Excluding
    the impact of these acquisitions, revenues increased
    $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    Our fraud and detection solutions revenue increased
    $59.1 million primarily in our fraud detection and forensic
    audit services for the home mortgage and mortgage insurance
    industries as well as in response to the increased scrutiny and
    refinancing within the mortgage industry. Increased revenue in
    our loss prediction solutions primarily resulted from our
    acquisitions and increased penetration of our existing
    customers. Our loss quantification revenues increased as a
    result of new customer contracts and volume increases associated
    with natural disasters experienced in the United States. Our

Cost of
    Revenues

Cost of revenues for our Decision Analytics segment was
    $260.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to $187.0 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, an increase of $73.8 million or
    39.5%. The increase was primarily due to the accelerated ESOP
    allocation, which resulted in a non-cash non-recurring charge of
    $19.0 million prior to our IPO and costs related to the
    newly acquired companies of $17.7 million. Excluding the
    accelerated ESOP allocation and the effect of the newly acquired
    companies, our cost of revenues increased $37.1 million or
    19.8%. The increase is primarily due to an increase in salaries
    and employee benefits of $22.1 million, which includes
    annual salary increases, medical costs and equity compensation
    and pension costs. This increase in salaries and employee
    benefit costs is related to a modest increase in employee
    headcount relative to the 27.6% revenue growth in our fraud
    identification and detection solutions and to an increase
    pension cost of $2.3 million due to the global economic
    downturn experienced in 2008. Other increases include third
    party data costs of $11.9 million, an increase in other
    operating expenses of $2.0 million, which include
    technology costs, and an increase in office maintenance costs of
    $1.1 million.



Selling,
    General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $80.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to $49.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, an increase of $30.7 million or
    62.2%. The increase is primarily due to the accelerated ESOP
    allocation, which resulted in a non-cash non-recurring charge of
    $5.8 million prior to our IPO and costs related to the
    newly acquired companies of $12.7 million. Excluding the
    accelerated ESOP allocation and the effect of the newly acquired
    companies, our SGA increased $12.2 million or 24.7%. The
    increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and
    employee benefits costs of $9.9 million, which include
    annual salary increases, medical costs and pension cost of
    $0.7 million. Other increases include an increase in legal
    costs of $0.3 million, and other general expenses of
    $2.3 million, partially offset by an insurance cost
    recovery of $0.3 million.

EBITDA
    Margin

The EBITDA margin for our Decision Analytics segment was 32.3%
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 39.2% for
    the year ended December 31, 2008. Included in the
    calculation of our EBITDA margin for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 are non-recurring non-cash costs of
    $24.8 million associated with the accelerated ESOP
    allocation prior to our IPO, representing a 4.9% negative impact
    in EBITDA margin, and increased pension costs of
    $3.0 million, representing a 0.6% negative impact on our
    EBITDA margin. Also included in the calculation of our EBITDA
    margin are costs of $2.9 and $0.7 million associated with
    the preparation for our IPO for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 representing a
    0.6% and 0.2% negative impact, respectively, in EBITDA margin.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 we had cash and cash
    equivalents and

available-for-sale

securities of $60.6 million and $77.0 million,
    respectively. Subscriptions for our solutions are billed and
    generally paid in advance of rendering services either quarterly
    or in full upon commencement of the subscription period, which
    is usually for one year. Subscriptions are automatically renewed
    at the beginning of each calendar year. We have historically
    generated significant cash flows from operations. As a result of
    this factor, as well as the availability of funds under our
    syndicated revolving credit facility, we believe we will have
    sufficient cash to meet our working capital and capital
    expenditure needs, including acquisition contingent payments,
    and to fuel our future growth plans.

We have historically managed the business with a working capital
    deficit due to the fact that, as described above, we offer our
    solutions and services primarily through annual subscriptions or
    long-term contracts, which are generally prepaid quarterly or
    annually in advance of the services being rendered. When cash is
    received for prepayment of invoices, we record an asset (cash
    and cash equivalents) on our balance



sheet with the offset recorded as a current liability (fees
    received in advance). This current liability is deferred revenue
    that does not require a direct cash outflow since our customers
    have prepaid and are obligated to purchase the services. In most
    businesses, growth in revenue typically leads to an increase in
    the accounts receivable balance causing a use of cash as a
    company grows. Unlike these businesses, our cash position is
    favorably affected by revenue growth, which results in a source
    of cash due to our customers prepaying for most of our services.

Our capital expenditures, which include non-cash purchases of
    fixed assets and capital lease obligations, as a percentage of
    revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and
    2008 were 3.6%, 4.3%, and 3.7%, respectively. We estimate our
    capital expenditures for 2011 will be approximately
    $60.0 million, which primarily include expenditures on our
    technology infrastructure and our continuing investments in
    developing and enhancing our solutions. Expenditures related to
    developing and enhancing our solutions are predominately related
    to internal use software and are capitalized in accordance with

ASC 350-40,

“Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use.”

The amounts capitalized in
    accordance with

ASC 985-20,

“

Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
    Marketed

,” are not significant to the financial
    statements.

We have also historically used a portion of our cash for
    repurchases of our common stock from our stockholders. For the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 we
    repurchased and redeemed $422.3 million, $46.7 million
    and $392.6 million, respectively, of our common stock.
    Included in the 2010 share repurchases are repurchases of
    $209.8 million of Class B, including
    $199.9 million and $9.9 million of Verisk

Class B-1

and

Class B-2,

respectively, which were not a part of the Repurchase Program. A
    substantial portion of the share redemption included in the
    total above was completed pursuant to the terms of the Insurance
    Service Office, Inc. 1996 Incentive Plan, or the Option Plan.

We provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain
    qualifying active employees and retirees. Based on the pension
    funding policy, we expect to contribute approximately
    $25.8 million to the pension plan in 2011. Under the
    postretirement plan, we provide certain healthcare and life
    insurance benefits to qualifying participants; however,
    participants are required to pay a stated percentage of the
    premium coverage. We expect to contribute approximately
    $4.2 million to the postretirement plan in 2011. See
    Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included
    in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Financing
    and Financing Capacity

We had total debt, excluding capital lease and other
    obligations, of $835.0 million and $585.0 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The debt at
    December 31, 2010 was held under long-term loan facilities
    drawn to finance our stock repurchases and acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2010, our $575 million Syndicated
    Revolving Credit Facility due September 2014, or credit
    facility, is a committed facility, where as all of our long-term
    loan facilities are uncommitted facilities. We have financed and
    expect to finance our short-term working capital needs, stock
    repurchases and acquisition contingent payments through cash
    from operations and borrowings from a combination of our
    long-term facilities and our credit facility.

On January 19, 2010 and January 25, 2010, we repaid
    $10.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively, of our
    outstanding borrowings from the credit facility. On
    September 10, 2010, we amended our credit facility to
    increase the capacity by $155.0 million to
    $575.0 million, to extend the maturity of the credit
    facility to September 10, 2014 and to modify certain
    restrictions. We paid a one-time fee of $1.8 million,
    reduced our ongoing unused facility fees from 0.375% to 0.200%
    and reduced our borrowing rate from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR
    plus 1.75%. The one-time fee will be amortized over a four-year
    period, which is consistent with the remaining life of the
    credit facility. We had borrowings of $310.0 million and
    $60.0 million from our credit facility outstanding as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We had available
    capacity of $263.0 million from our credit facility at
    December 31, 2010. Upon completion of our follow-on
    offering on October 1, 2010, we funded a portion of our
    share repurchase with proceeds from borrowings of
    $160.0 million under our credit facility of which we have
    repaid $105.0 million as of December 31, 2010. We also
    funded the acquisitions of 100% of the common stock of 3E
    Company and Crowe Paradis Services Corporation on



December 16, 2010 and December 14, 2010, respectively,
    with a portion of the proceeds from borrowings from our credit
    facility of $255.0 million.

The $575 million credit facility contains certain customary
    financial and other covenants that, among other things, impose
    certain restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, and
    capital expenditures. These covenants also place restrictions on
    mergers, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions, payments
    between us and our subsidiaries, cross defaults, and certain
    transactions with affiliates. The financial covenants require
    that, at the end of any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated
    interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and that during
    any period of four fiscal quarters we maintain a consolidated
    funded debt leverage ratio of below 3.0 to 1.0. We were in
    compliance with all debt covenants under the credit facility as
    of December 31, 2010.

We also have long-term loan facilities under uncommitted master
    shelf agreements with Aviva Investors North America, or Aviva,
    New York Life and Prudential Capital Group, or Prudential, with
    capacities at December 31, 2010 in the amounts of
    $20.0 million, $30.0 million and $115.0 million,
    respectively. We can borrow under the Aviva Master Shelf
    Agreement until December 10, 2011. On March 16, 2010,
    we amended the New York Life Master Shelf Agreement to increase
    the authorization of additional senior promissory notes from
    $100.0 million to $115.0 million, and to extend the
    maturity of the agreement through March 16, 2013. On
    August 30, 2010, we amended the Prudential Master Shelf
    Agreement to extend the maturity of the agreement through
    August 30, 2013.

On June 15, 2009, we repaid our $100.0 million
    Prudential Series D senior notes. In order to pay the
    Prudential Series D senior notes, we issued Series J
    senior promissory notes under the uncommitted master shelf
    agreement with Prudential in the aggregate principal amount of
    $50.0 million due June 15, 2016 and borrowed
    $50.0 million from our revolving credit facility with Bank
    of America N.A. Interest on the Prudential Series J senior
    notes is payable quarterly at a fixed rate of 6.85% on the
    senior promissory notes.

On April 27, 2009, we issued a senior promissory note under
    an uncommitted master shelf agreement with Aviva in the
    aggregate principal amount of $30.0 million due
    April 27, 2013. Interest is payable quarterly at a fixed
    rate of 6.46%.

The notes outstanding under these facilities mature over the
    next six years. Individual borrowings are made at a fixed rate
    of interest determined at the time of the borrowing and interest
    is payable quarterly. The weighted average rate of interest with
    respect to our outstanding borrowings under these facilities was
    6.07% and 6.11% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. The uncommitted master shelf agreements
    contain certain covenants that limit our ability to create
    liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and
    consolidate, merge or sell assets to another company. The Aviva
    and New York Life Master Shelf Agreements also contain financial
    covenants that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage
    ratio of no less than 275% during any period of four fiscal
    quarters and a leverage ratio of no more than 300% at the end of
    any fiscal quarter. The Prudential Master Shelf Agreement also
    contains financial covenants that require that, at the end of
    any fiscal quarter, we have a consolidated interest coverage
    ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and a leverage ratio of no more
    than 300% at the end of any fiscal quarter. We were in
    compliance with all debt covenants under our master shelf
    agreements as of December 31, 2010.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $336.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to $326.4 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The increase in operating activities was
    primarily due to an increase in cash receipts from customers and
    a reduction in interest payments, partially offset by an
    increase in operating expense and tax payments during the year
    ended December 31, 2010. Increased pension contributions of
    $15.0 million in 2010, as well as the timing of certain
    annual bonus payments, mitigated the growth in our operating
    cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased to
    $326.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to $247.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The increase in net cash provided by
    operating activities was principally due to an increase in cash
    receipts of $141.5 million, a decrease in excess tax
    benefit from exercised stock options of $6.1 million, a
    decrease in payments of acquisition related liabilities of
    $1.9 million, and a decrease in salary and employee related
    payments of $10.2 million due to an additional pay-cycle
    that occurred in 2008. Our payroll is processed on a bi-weekly
    basis thereby requiring an additional pay-cycle once every ten
    years. This increase in net cash provided by operating
    activities was partially offset by an increase in operating
    expense related payments of $63.6 million, an increase in
    tax payments of $12.1 million and an increase in interest
    payments of $5.2 million.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $243.7 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2010 and
    $185.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily
    due to an increase in acquisitions, including escrow funding, of
    $136.6 million partially offset by a decrease in earnout
    payments of $78.1 million.

Net cash used in investing activities was $185.3 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 and
    $130.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    The increase in net cash used in investing activities was
    principally due to increased cash paid for acquisitions,
    including escrow funding, of $48.5 million and an increase
    in purchases of fixed assets of $8.0 million.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $108.8 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2010 and
    $102.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    The increase in net cash used in financing activities can be
    attributed to an increase in share repurchases of
    $388.4 million primarily through our Repurchase Program and
    the shares repurchased as part of our follow-on public offering
    on October 1, 2010. The increase was partially offset by
    net debt receipts of $325.6 million and cash inflows from
    stock option exercises of $56.8 million.

Net cash used in financing activities was $102.8 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 and
    $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was
    principally due to a decrease in the repurchases of stock of
    $345.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in net
    proceeds from the issuance of long-term and short-term debt of
    $312.5 million, a decrease in proceeds from stock options
    exercised of $22.6 million and a decrease in excess tax
    benefit from stock options exercised of $6.1 million.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial
    condition and results of operations are based on our
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States. The preparation of these financial statements
    require management to make estimates and judgments that affect
    reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
    the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the
    reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical
    experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be
    reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis,
    management evaluates its estimates, including those related to
    revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, pension and
    other post retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, and
    income taxes. Actual results may differ from these assumptions
    or conditions.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of
    services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and
    information is delivered to our customers. Revenue is recognized
    when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
    occurred or services have been rendered, fees

and/or

price
    are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably
    assured. Revenues for subscription services are recognized
    ratably over the subscription term, usually one year. Revenues
    from transaction-based fees are recognized as information is
    delivered to customers, assuming all other revenue recognition
    criteria are met.



The Company also has term based software licenses where the only
    remaining undelivered element is post-contract customer support
    or PCS, including unspecified upgrade rights on a when and if
    available basis. The Company recognizes revenue for these
    licenses ratably over the duration of the license term. The
    Company also provides hosting or software solutions that provide
    continuous access to information and include PCS and recognizes
    revenue ratably over the duration of the license term. In
    addition, the determination of certain of our services revenues
    requires the use of estimates, principally related to
    transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are
    reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears. In
    these instances, we estimate transaction volumes based on
    average actual volumes reported by our customers in the past.
    Differences between our estimates and actual final volumes
    reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are
    reported. We have not experienced significant variances between
    our estimates of these services revenues reported to us by our
    customers and actual reported volumes in the past.

We invoice our customers in annual, quarterly, or monthly
    installments. Amounts billed and collected in advance are
    recorded as fees received in advance on the balance sheet and
    are recognized as the services are performed and revenue
    recognition criteria are met.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

On January 1, 2005, we adopted the new accounting standard
    for

Share Based Payment

using a prospective approach,
    which required us to record compensation expense for all awards
    granted after the date of adoption based on the grant date fair
    value. As the majority of annual grants have a four year vesting
    term, the compensation expense for 2005 through 2007 is not
    comparable in subsequent periods, as there is no compensation
    expense recorded for the vesting of awards granted from 2002
    through 2004. The following table illustrates the amount of
    annual compensation expense resulting from the implementation of
    this standard using the prospective approach for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

The fair value of equity awards is measured on the date of grant
    using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the
    use of several estimates, including expected term, expected
    risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and expected
    dividend yield.

Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date,
    based on the fair value of the awards granted, and is recognized
    as expense over the requisite service period. Option grants are
    expensed ratably over the four-year vesting period. We follow
    the substantive vesting period approach for awards granted after
    January 1, 2005, which requires that stock-based
    compensation expense be recognized over the period from the date
    of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on
    the employee providing additional service.

We estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of
    grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards
    expected to vest. The forfeiture assumption is ultimately
    adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.

Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the common stock underlying
    the stock-based compensation was determined quarterly on or
    about the final day of the quarter. The valuation methodology
    was based on a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors
    including the nature of the business and history of the
    enterprise,



the economic outlook in general, the condition of the specific
    industries in which we operate, the financial condition of the
    business, our ability to generate free cash flow, and goodwill
    or other intangible asset value.

The fair value of our common stock was determined using
    generally accepted valuation methodologies, including the use of
    the guideline company method. This determination of fair market
    value employs both a comparable company analysis, which examines
    the valuation multiples of public companies deemed comparable,
    in whole or in part, to us and a discounted cash flow analysis
    that determines a present value of the projected future cash
    flows of the business. The comparable companies are comprised of
    a combination of public companies in the financial services
    information and technology businesses. These methodologies have
    been consistently applied since 1997. We regularly assess the
    underlying assumptions used in the valuation methodologies,
    including the comparable companies to be used in the analysis,
    the future forecasts of revenue and earnings, and the impact of
    market conditions on factors such as the weighted average cost
    of capital. These assumptions are reviewed quarterly, with a
    more comprehensive evaluation performed annually. For the
    comparable company analysis, the share price and financial
    performance of these comparables were updated quarterly based on
    the most recent public information. Our stock price was also
    impacted by the number of shares outstanding. As the number of
    shares outstanding has declined over time, our share price has
    increased. The determination of the fair value of our common
    stock required us to make judgments that were complex and
    inherently subjective. If different assumptions are used in
    future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be
    materially impacted in the future.

Goodwill
    and Intangibles

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the
    fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible
    assets of the businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible
    assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
    Intangible assets determined to have definite lives are
    amortized over their useful lives. Goodwill and intangible
    assets with indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing
    annually as of June 30, or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully
    recoverable, using the guidance and criteria described in the
    accounting standard for

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

. This testing compares carrying values to fair values
    and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is
    reduced to fair value.

As of December 31, 2010, we had goodwill and net intangible
    assets of $832.9 million, which represents 68.4% of our
    total assets. During fiscal year 2010, we performed an
    impairment test as of June 30, 2010 and confirmed that no
    impairment charge was necessary. There are many assumptions and
    estimates used that directly impact the results of impairment
    testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues,
    earnings and cash flows, useful lives and discount rates applied
    to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value. We
    have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results
    based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for determining
    the fair value of our reporting units. To mitigate undue
    influence, we set criteria and benchmarks that are reviewed and
    approved by various levels of management and reviewed by other
    independent parties. The determination of whether or not
    goodwill or indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have
    become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the
    assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to
    determine the value of our reporting units. Changes in our
    strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these
    judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of
    intangible assets and goodwill. Neither our initial valuation
    nor our subsequent analysis have indicated any impairment of our
    goodwill asset of $632.7 million as of December 31,
    2010.

Pension
    and Postretirement

We account for our pension and postretirement benefit plans in
    accordance with the accounting standard for

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans.

This standard requires that employers recognize on a
    prospective basis the funded status of their defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their
    consolidated balance sheets and recognize as a component of
    other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax, the gains or
    losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the
    period but are not recognized as components of net periodic
    benefit cost.



Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible
    assets are also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard.

As of December 31, 2009, we adopted the new disclosure
    requirements that require disclosures about pension plan assets
    including how investment allocation decisions are made;
    including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of
    investment policies and strategies, the major categories of plan
    assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the
    fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements
    using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on
    changes in plan assets for the period and significant
    concentrations of risk within the plan assets. See Note 17
    to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual
    report on

Form 10-K.

Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual
    net period benefit cost and the disclosure of the funded status
    of these plans. The principal assumptions concern the discount
    rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation, the
    expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of future
    compensation increases. We revise these assumptions based on an
    annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that
    may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.

In determining the discount rate, we utilize quoted rates from
    long-term bond indices, and changes in long-term bond rates over
    the past year, cash flow models and other data sources we
    consider reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining
    service life of eligible employees. As part of our evaluation,
    we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that
    were selected to match our separate projected cash flows for
    both the pension and postretirement plans. Our separate benefit
    plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include
    data for corporate bonds rated AA or better at the measurement
    date. The output from the actuarial models are assessed against
    the prior year’s discount rate and quoted rates for
    long-term bond indices. For our pension plan at
    December 31, 2010, we determined this rate to be 5.49%, a
    decrease of 0.25% from the 5.74% rate used at December 31,
    2009. Our postretirement rate is 4.00% at December 31,
    2010, a decrease of 0.50% from the 4.50% used at
    December 31, 2009.

The expected return on plan assets of 8.25% as of
    December 31, 2010 is determined by taking into
    consideration our analysis of our actual historical investment
    returns to a broader long-term forecast adjusted based on our
    target investment allocation, and the current economic
    environment. Our investment guidelines target an investment
    portfolio allocation of 40.0% debt securities and 60.0% equity
    securities. As of December 31, 2010, the plan assets were
    allocated 42.0% debt, 56.0% equity securities, and 2.0% to other
    investments. We have used our target investment allocation to
    derive the expected return as we believe this allocation will be
    retained on an ongoing basis that will be commensurate with the
    projected cash flows of the plan. The expected return for each
    investment category within our target investment allocation is
    developed using average historical rates of return for each
    targeted investment category, considering the projected cash
    flow of the pension plan. The difference between this expected
    return and the actual return on plan assets is generally
    deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future
    net periodic benefit costs. We believe these considerations
    provide the basis for reasonable assumptions with respect to the
    expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

The rate of compensation increase is based on our long-term
    plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine
    the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31. The
    future benefit payments for the postretirement plan are net of
    the federal medical subsidy. As a result of the Patient
    Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and
    Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the tax treatment of
    federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit
    plans that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least
    actuarially equivalent to the corresponding benefits provided
    under Medicare Part D was effectively changed. This
    legislative change reduces future tax benefits of the coverage
    we provided to participants in the Postretirement Plan. We are
    required to account for this change in the period during which
    the law is enacted. As a result, we recorded a non-cash tax
    charge to the provision for income taxes of $2.4 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2010.



A one percent change in discount rate, future rate of return on
    plan assets and the rate of future compensation would have the

Income
    Taxes

In projecting future taxable income, we develop assumptions
    including the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax
    operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the
    implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
    These assumptions require significant judgment about the
    forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the
    plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
    The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing
    with uncertainties in the application and evolution of complex
    tax laws and regulations in other jurisdictions.

We follow

ASC 740-10

guidance for accounting for income taxes, which addresses the
    determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be
    claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
    statements. Under this interpretation, we may recognize the tax
    benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely
    than not that the tax position will be sustained upon
    examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
    merits of the position. As a result of the implementation of
    this interpretation, we recognized an increase in the liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately
    $10.3 million, which was accounted for as an increase to
    the January 1, 2007 balance of retained
    earnings/(accumulated deficit).

We recognize and adjust our liabilities when our judgment
    changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not
    previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these
    uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment
    that is materially different from our current estimate of the
    tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as
    increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in
    which they are determined.

As of December 31, 2010 we have federal and state income
    tax net operating loss carryforwards of $60.8 million,
    which will expire at various dates from 2011 through 2030. Such
    net operating loss carryforwards expire as follows:

(In thousands)

2011 - 2018

$

44,973

2019 - 2023


2024 - 2030

15,396

$

60,805

The significant majority of the state net operating loss
    carryforwards were generated by a subsidiary that employs our
    internal staff as a result of favorable tax deductions from the
    exercise of employee stock options for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005. This subsidiary’s state
    net operating loss carryforwards are expected to be fully
    utilized as the subsidiary generates sufficient taxable income
    to utilize losses.

We estimate unrecognized tax positions of $4.9 million that
    may be recognized by December 31, 2011, due to expiration
    of statutes of limitations and resolution of audits with taxing
    authorities, net of additional uncertain tax positions.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest
    rates. At December 31, 2010, we had borrowings outstanding
    under our syndicated revolving credit facility of
    $310.0 million, which bear interest at variable rates based
    on LIBOR plus 1.75%. A change in interest rates on this variable
    rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does
    not impact the fair value of the instruments. Based on our
    overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2010, a one
    percent change in interest rates would result in a change in
    annual pretax interest expense of approximately
    $3.1 million based on our current level of borrowings.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures
    (as that term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed in our reports under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
    within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
    appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
    achieving the desired control objectives.

Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e))

as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on

Form 10-K.

Based upon the foregoing assessments, our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2010, our disclosure controls and procedures
    were effective.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial
    reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of
    internal control over financial reporting can provide only
    reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in
    conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
    or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework set forth in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal
    control over financial reporting was effective at
    December 31, 2010.

Management excluded from its assessment the internal control
    over financial reporting at Crowe Paradis Services Corporation
    (“CP”) and 3E Company (“3E”), which were
    acquired on December 14, 2010 and December 16, 2010,
    respectively. The combined excluded financial statements of
    these two acquisitions constitute approximately 1.5% of total
    assets, less than 1.0% of total revenues, and less than 1.0% of
    net income included within our consolidated financial statement
    amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010. Due
    to the timing of the acquisitions, management did not assess the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for
    CP and 3E.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial
    statements included in this annual report on

Form 10-K

has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, as stated in
    their report which is included herein.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Verisk Analytics, Inc.

Jersey City, New Jersey

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
    stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
    Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial
    statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
    opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL
    CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Verisk Analytics, Inc.

Jersey City, New Jersey

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Verisk Analytics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2010, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal
    control over financial reporting at Crowe Paradis Services
    Corporation (“CP”) and 3E Company (“3E”),
    which were acquired on December 14, 2010 and
    December 16, 2010, respectively, and whose combined
    financial statements constitute approximately 1.5% of total
    assets, less than 1.0% of total revenues and less than 1.0% of
    net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of
    and for the year ended December 31, 2010. Accordingly, our
    audit did not include the internal control over financial
    reporting at CP and 3E. The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway

    programs and to assist insurance companies in meeting state
    regulatory requirements. Over the past decade, the Company has
    broadened its data assets, entered new markets, placed a greater
    emphasis on analytics, and pursued strategic acquisitions. On
    October 6, 2009, ISO effected a corporate reorganization
    whereby the Class A and Class B common stock of ISO
    were exchanged by the current stockholders for the common stock
    of Verisk on a

one-for-one

basis. Verisk immediately thereafter effected a

fifty-for-one

stock split of its Class A and Class B common stock
    and equally

sub-divided

the Class B common stock into two new series of stock,
    Verisk Class B (Series 1)

(“Class B-1”)

and Verisk Class B (Series 2)

(“Class B-2”).

All share and per share information in the consolidated
    financial statements gives effect to the

fifty-for-one

stock split that occurred immediately after the reorganization.

On October 9, 2009, the Company completed its IPO. Upon
    completion of the IPO, the selling stockholders sold
    97,995,750 shares of Class A common stock of Verisk,
    which included the 12,745,750 over-allotment option, at the IPO
    price of $22.00 per share. The Company did not receive any
    proceeds from the sales of common stock in the offering. Verisk
    trades under the ticker symbol “VRSK” on the NASDAQ
    Global Select Market.

On October 1, 2010, the Company completed a follow-on
    public offering. Upon completion of this offering, the selling
    stockholders sold 2,602,212, 7,309,963 and
    11,972,917 shares of Class A,

Class B-1

and

Class B-2

common stock of Verisk, respectively, at the public offering
    price of $27.25 per share.

Class B-1

and

Class B-2

common stock sold into this offering were automatically
    converted into Class A common stock. The Company did not
    receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the
    offering. Concurrent with the closing of this offering, the
    Company also repurchased 7,254,407 and 45,593 shares of

Class B-1

and

Class B-2

common stock, respectively, at $26.3644 per share, which
    represents the net proceeds per share the selling stockholders
    received in the public offering. The Company funded a portion of
    this repurchase with proceeds from borrowings of $160,000 under
    its syndicated revolving credit facility.

Class B-1

and

Class B-2 shares

will automatically convert to Class A common stock on
    April 6, 2011 and October 6, 2011, respectively.

Basis of
    Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies:

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
    prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America
    (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with these accounting principles
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates
    include acquisition purchase price allocations, the fair value
    of goodwill, the realization of deferred tax assets, acquisition
    related liabilities, fair value of stock based

compensation, liabilities for pension and postretirement
    benefits, fair value of the Company’s redeemable common
    stock, and the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts.
    Actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
    Significant accounting policies include the following:

(a)

Intercompany Accounts and Transactions

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Verisk. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
    eliminated.

(b)

Revenue Recognition

The following describes the Company’s primary types of
    revenues and the applicable revenue recognition policies. The
    Company’s revenues are primarily derived from sales of
    services and revenue is recognized as services are performed and
    information is delivered to our customers. Revenue is recognized
    when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
    occurred or services have been rendered, fees

and/or

price
    is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably
    assured. Revenue is recognized net of applicable sales tax
    withholdings.

Industry-Standard Insurance Programs, Statistical Agent and Data
    Services and Actuarial Services

Industry-standard insurance programs, statistical agent and data
    services and actuarial services are sold to participating
    insurance company customers under annual agreements covering a
    calendar year where the price is determined at the inception of
    the agreement. In accordance with Accounting Standards
    Codification (“ASC”) 605,

Revenue Recognition,

the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the term of
    these annual agreements, as services are performed and
    continuous access to information is provided over the entire
    term of the agreements.

Property-Specific Rating and Underwriting Information

The Company provides property-specific rating information
    through reports issued for specific commercial properties, for
    which revenue is recognized when the report is delivered to the
    customer, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria
    are met.

In addition, the Company provides hosting or software solutions
    that provide continuous access to information about the
    properties being insured and underwriting information in the
    form of standard policy forms to be used by customers. As the
    customer has a contractual right to take possession of the
    software without significant penalty, revenues from these
    arrangements are recognized ratably over the contract period
    from the time when the customer had access to the solution in
    accordance with

ASC 985-605,

Software Revenue Recognition

(“ASC

985-605”).

The Company recognizes software license revenue when the
    arrangement does not require significant production,
    customization or modification of the software and the following
    criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an agreement exists,
    delivery has occurred, fees are fixed or determinable, and
    collections are probable. These software arrangements include
    post-contract customer support (“PCS”). The Company
    recognizes software license revenue ratably over the duration of
    the annual license term as vendor specific objective evidence
    (“VSOE”) of PCS, the only remaining undelivered
    element, cannot be established in accordance with

ASC 985-605.

Fraud Identification and Detection Solutions

Fraud identification and detection solutions are comprised of
    transaction-based fees recognized as information is delivered to
    customers, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria
    have been met.

Loss Prediction

Loss prediction solutions consist of term-based software
    licenses. These software arrangements include PCS, which
    includes unspecified upgrades on a

when-and-if

available basis.



VERISK
    ANALYTICS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company recognizes software license revenue ratably over the
    duration of the annual license term as VSOE of PCS, the only
    remaining undelivered element, cannot be established in
    accordance with

ASC 985-605.

The Company also provides software hosting arrangements to
    customers whereby the customer does not have the right to take
    possession of the software. As these arrangements include PCS
    throughout the hosting term, revenues from these multiple
    element arrangements are recognized in accordance with

ASC 605-25,

Revenue Recognition Multiple Element Arrangements

(“ASC

605-25”).

The Company recognizes revenue ratably over the duration of the
    license term, which ranges from one to five years, since the
    contractual elements do not have stand alone value.

The Company services long-term contract arrangements with
    certain customers. For these arrangements, revenue is recognized
    in accordance with

ASC 605-35,

Revenue Recognition Construction Type and Certain
    Production-Type Contracts

(“ASC

605-35”),

using the

percentage-of-completion

method, which requires the use of estimates. In such instances,
    management is required to estimate the input measures, based on
    hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours of the
    project, with consideration also given to output measures, such
    as contract milestones, when applicable. Adjustments to
    estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring
    such revisions become known. Accordingly, recognized revenues
    and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses
    to completion. The Company considers the contract substantially
    complete when there is compliance with all performance
    specifications and there are no remaining costs or potential
    risk.

Loss Quantification

Loss quantification solutions consist of term-based software
    subscription licenses and revenues are recognized in accordance
    with

ASC 985-605.

These software arrangements include PCS, which includes
    unspecified upgrades on a

when-and-if

available basis. Customers are billed for access on a monthly
    basis and the Company recognizes revenue accordingly.

With respect to an insignificant percentage of revenues, the
    Company uses contract accounting, as required by

ASC 985-605,

when the arrangement with the customer includes significant
    customization, modification or production of software. For these
    elements, revenue is recognized in accordance with

ASC 605-35,

using the

percentage-of-completion

method as noted above.

(c)

Fees Received in Advance

The Company invoices its customers in annual, quarterly,
    monthly, or milestone installments. Amounts billed and collected
    in advance of contract terms are recorded as “Fees received
    in advance” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
    and are recognized as the services are performed and the
    applicable revenue recognition criteria are met.

(d)

Fixed Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets

Property and equipment, internal-use software and finite-lived
    intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
    amortization, which are computed on a straight-line basis over
    their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are
    amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or
    the lease term.

The Company’s internal software development costs primarily
    relate to internal-use software. Such costs are capitalized in
    the application development stage in accordance with

ASC 350-40,

Internal-use Software

. Software development costs are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a three year period,
    which management believes represents the useful life of these
    capitalized costs.



VERISK
    ANALYTICS, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In accordance with ASC 360,

Property, Plant &
    Equipment

, whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets and
    finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, the
    Company reviews its long-lived assets and finite-lived
    intangible assets for impairment by first comparing the carrying
    value of the assets to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
    expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
    assets. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the
    assets’ undiscounted cash flows, the Company estimates an
    impairment loss by taking the difference between the carrying
    value and fair value of the assets.

(e)

Capital and Operating Leases

The Company leases various property, plant and equipment. Leased
    property is accounted for under ASC 840,

Leases

(“ASC 840”). Accordingly, leased property that
    meets certain criteria is capitalized and the present value of
    the related lease payments is recorded as a liability.
    Amortization of assets accounted for as capital leases is
    computed utilizing the straight-line method over the shorter of
    the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life
    (principally 3 to 4 years for computer equipment and
    automobiles).

All other leases are accounted for as operating leases. Rent
    expense for operating leases, which may have rent escalation
    provisions or rent holidays, are recorded on a straight-line
    basis over the non-cancelable bases lease period in accordance
    with ASC 840. The initial lease term generally includes the
    build-out period, where no rent payments are typically due under
    the terms of the lease. The difference between rent expense and
    rent paid is recorded as deferred rent. Construction allowances
    received from landlords are recorded as a deferred rent credit
    and amortized to rent expense over the term of the lease.

(f)

Investments

The Company’s investments at December 31, 2010 and
    2009 includes registered investment companies and equity
    investments in non-public companies. The Company accounts for
    short-term investments in accordance with ASC 320,

Investments-Debt and Equity Securities

(“ASC
    320”).

There are no investments classified as trading securities at
    December 31, 2010 or 2009. All investments with readily
    determinable market values are classified as

available-for-sale.

While these investments are not held with the specific intention
    to sell them, they may be sold to support the Company’s
    investment strategies. All

available-for-sale

investments are carried at fair value. The cost of all

available-for-sale

investments sold is based on the specific identification method,
    with the exception of mutual fund-based investments, which is
    based on the weighted average cost method. Dividend income is
    accrued on the ex-dividend date.

The Company performs periodic reviews of its investment
    portfolio when individual holdings have experienced a decline in
    fair value below their respective cost. The Company considers a
    number of factors in the evaluation of whether a decline in
    value is

other-than-temporary

including: (a) the financial condition and near term
    prospects of the issuer; (b) the Company’s ability and
    intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient
    to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; and (c) the
    period and degree to which the market value has been below cost.
    Where the decline is deemed to be

other-than-temporary,

a charge is recorded to “Realized gains/(losses) on
    securities, net” in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations, and a new cost basis is established
    for the investment.

The Company’s equity investments in non-public companies
    are included in “Other assets” in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets. Those securities are carried at
    cost, as the Company owns less than 20% of the stock and does
    not otherwise have the ability to exercise significant
    influence. These securities are written down to their estimated
    realizable value when



VERISK

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

management considers there is an

other-than-temporary

decline in value based on financial information received and the
    business prospects of the entity.

(g)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company follows the provisions of

ASC 820-10,

Fair Value Measurements

(“ASC

820-10”),

which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value under U.S. GAAP and expands fair value
    measurement disclosures. The Company follows the provisions of

ASC 820-10

for its financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed
    at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company follows the
    provisions of

ASC 820-10

for its non-financial assets and liabilities recognized or
    disclosed at fair value.

(h)

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable is generally recorded at the invoiced
    amount. The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based
    on an analysis of the aging of the accounts receivable,
    historical write-offs, customer payment patterns, individual
    customer creditworthiness, current economic trends,

and/or

establishment of specific reserves for customers in adverse
    financial condition. The Company reassesses the adequacy of the
    allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis.

(i)

Foreign Currency

The Company has determined local currencies are the functional
    currencies of the foreign operations. The assets and liabilities
    of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the period-end rate of
    exchange and statement of operations items are translated at the
    average rates prevailing during the year. The resulting
    translation adjustment is recorded as a component of
    “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of changes in
    stockholders’ deficit.

(j)

Stock Based Compensation

The Company follows ASC 718,

Stock Compensation

(“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, stock-based
    compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the
    fair value of the options granted, and is recognized as expense
    over the requisite service period. On January 1, 2005, the
    Company adopted ASC 718 using a prospective approach, as
    required under ASC 718. Under this application, the Company
    is required to record compensation expense for all awards
    granted after the date of adoption.

Prior to January 1, 2008, the expected term (estimated
    period of time outstanding) was estimated using the simplified
    method as defined in ASC 718, in which the expected term
    equals the average of graded vesting term and the contractual
    term. Subsequent to January 1, 2008, the expected term was
    primarily estimated based on studies of historical experience
    and projected exercise behavior. However, certain awards
    granted, for which no historical exercise patterns exist, the
    expected term was estimated using the simplified method. The
    risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of
    U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a maturity equal
    to the expected term of the equity award. Expected volatility
    for awards prior to January 1, 2008 was based on the
    Company’s historical volatility for a period equal to the
    stock option’s expected term, ending on the day of grant,
    and calculated on a quarterly basis for purposes of the ISO
    401(k) Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Plan
    (“KSOP”). For awards granted after January 1,
    2008, the volatility factor was based on an average of the
    historical stock prices of a group of the Company’s peers
    over the most recent period commensurate with the expected term
    of the stock option award. Prior to 2008, the expected dividend
    yield was not included in the fair value calculation as the
    Company did not pay dividends. For awards granted after
    January 1, 2008, the expected dividends yield was based on
    the Company’s expected annual dividend rate on the date of
    grant.



VERISK
    ANALYTICS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company estimates expected forfeitures of equity awards at
    the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense only for
    those awards expected to vest. The forfeiture assumption is
    ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate. Changes in
    the forfeiture assumptions may impact the total amount of
    expense ultimately recognized over the requisite service period,
    and may impact the timing of expense recognized over the
    requisite service period.

(k)

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs, which primarily relate to the
    personnel and related overhead costs incurred in developing new
    services for our customers, are expensed as incurred. Such costs
    were $14,870, $14,109 and $11,054 for the years ended December
    31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and were included in
    “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

(l)

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
    liability method under ASC 740,

Income Taxes

(“ASC 740”), which requires the recognition of
    deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
    consequences of events that have been included in the financial
    statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based on the differences between the
    financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities
    using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in
    tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized
    in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent these assets are
    more likely than not to be realized. In making such
    determination, the Company considers all available positive and
    negative evidence, including future reversals of existing
    taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income,
    tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
    Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax
    assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all
    or some of the potential deferred tax assets will not be
    realized.

The Company follows

ASC 740-10,

Income Taxes

(“ASC

740-10”)

,

which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in the financial statements.

ASC 740-10

provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may
    be recognized based on the technical merits when it is more
    likely than not that the position will be sustained upon
    examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or
    litigation processes. Income tax positions must meet a more
    likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to
    be recognized upon the adoption of

ASC 740-10

and in subsequent periods. This interpretation also provides
    guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest
    and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in
    the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued
    interest and penalties are included within “Other
    liabilities” on the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets.

(m)

Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) are
    determined in accordance with ASC 260,

Earnings per
    Share

, which specifies the computation, presentation and
    disclosure requirements for EPS. Basic EPS excludes all dilutive
    common stock equivalents. It is based upon the weighted average
    number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
    EPS, as calculated using the treasury stock method, reflects the
    potential dilution that would occur if the Company’s
    dilutive



VERISK
    ANALYTICS, INC.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

outstanding stock options were exercised. For purposes of
    calculating EPS, Class A,

Class B-1

and

Class B-2

common shares are combined since all classes have identical
    rights to earnings.

(n)

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The Company accounts for its pension and postretirement benefits
    under ASC 715,

Compensation — Retirement
    Benefits

(“ASC 715”). ASC 715 requires the
    recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the
    balance sheet, the recognition in other comprehensive income of
    gains or losses and prior service costs or credits arising
    during the period, but which are not included as components of
    periodic benefit cost, and the measurement of defined benefit
    plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. The
    Company utilizes a valuation date of December 31.

(o)

Product Warranty Obligations

The Company provides warranty coverage for certain of its
    products. The Company recognizes a product warranty obligation
    when claims are probable and can be reasonably estimated. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, product warranty obligations
    were not significant.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into
    numerous agreements that contain standard indemnities whereby
    the Company indemnifies another party for breaches of
    confidentiality, infringement of intellectual property or gross
    negligence. Such indemnifications are primarily granted under
    licensing of computer software. Most agreements contain
    provisions to limit the maximum potential amount of future
    payments that the Company could be required to make under these
    indemnifications, however, the Company is not able to develop an
    estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments to
    be made under these indemnifications as the triggering events
    are not subject to predictability.

(p)

Loss Contingencies

The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation, claims and
    other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable
    and reasonably estimable. Such estimates are based on
    management’s judgment. Actual amounts paid may differ from
    amounts estimated, and such differences will be charged to
    operations in the period in which the final determination of the
    liability is made.

(q)

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the
    fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible
    assets of the businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible
    assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
    Intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized
    over their useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with
    indefinite lives are subject to impairment testing annually as
    of June 30 or whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
    The Company completed the required annual impairment test as of
    June 30, 2010, which resulted in no impairment of goodwill
    in 2010. This test compares the carrying value of each reporting
    unit to its fair value. If the fair value of the reporting unit
    exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, including goodwill
    assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. If
    the carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets,
    including goodwill, exceeds the fair value of the reporting
    unit, then the Company will determine the implied fair value of
    the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of a
    reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value,
    then an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between
    the carrying amount and the implied fair value of the goodwill.

    after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about
    the disaggregated activity in the rollforward for Level 3
    fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for
    interim periods within those fiscal periods. The adoption of the
    portion of ASU

No. 2010-06

that discusses the transfers between Level 1, Level 2
    and Level 3 inputs, effective January 1, 2010, did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. As the Company currently disaggregates the
    activity in the rollforward for Level 3 fair value
    measurements, they do not expect ASU

No. 2010-06

to have any impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-13,

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

(“ASU

No. 2009-13”).

ASU

No. 2009-13

establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for
    arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple
    revenue-generating activities. Specifically, ASU

No. 2009-13

addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and
    allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of
    accounting. ASU

No. 2009-13

is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into
    or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has
    elected not to early adopt. ASU

No. 2009-13

is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements as our Company’s multiple
    deliverables arrangements are comprised primarily of software
    licenses and services, rather than hardware. Currently, a
    majority of our deliverables do not have stand alone value,
    which would preclude the separation and allocation of the
    arrangement. Therefore, the Company will continue to recognize
    revenue over the duration of the license term.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk:

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to
    credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
    available for sale securities and accounts receivable, which are
    generally not collateralized. The Company maintains, in cash and
    cash equivalents, higher credit quality financial institutions
    in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. The total cash
    balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (“FDIC”) to a maximum amount of $250 per
    bank at December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the Company had cash balances on deposit that
    exceeded the balance insured by the FDIC limit by approximately
    $35,514 and $54,339 with six banks, respectively. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company also had cash on
    deposit with foreign banks of approximately $18,198 and $16,130,
    respectively.

The Company considers the concentration of credit risk
    associated with its trade accounts receivable to be commercially
    reasonable and believes that such concentration does not result
    in the significant risk of near-term severe adverse impacts. The
    Company’s top fifty customers represent approximately 45%
    of revenues, for all periods presented, with no individual
    customer accounting for more than 5%, 4% and 4% of revenues
    during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. No individual customer comprised more than 10% of
    accounts receivable at December 31, 2010 or 2009.

4.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents:

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks, commercial
    paper, money-market funds, and other liquid instruments with
    original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of
    purchase.

Fair
    Value Measurements

Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are reported at
    fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Such
    assets and liabilities include amounts for both financial and
    non-financial instruments. To increase consistency and
    comparability of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value,

ASC 820-10

establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy to prioritize the
    inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.

ASC 820-10

requires disclosures detailing the extent to which
    companies’ measure assets and liabilities at fair value,
    the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the
    effect of fair value measurements on earnings. In accordance
    with

ASC 820-10,

the Company applied the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 —

Assets or liabilities for which the identical item is traded on
    an active exchange, such as publicly-traded instruments.

Level 2 —

Assets and liabilities valued based on observable market data
    for similar instruments.

Level 3 —

Assets or liabilities for which significant valuation
    assumptions are not readily observable in the market;
    instruments valued based on the best available data, some of
    which is internally-developed, and considers risk premiums that
    a market participant would require.

The following tables provide information for such assets and
    liabilities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. The fair
    values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
    accounts payable and accrued liabilities, acquisition related
    liabilities prior to the adoption of ASC 805,

Business
    Combinations

(“ASC 805”), short-term debt, and
    short-term debt expected to be refinanced approximate their
    carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these
    instruments. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt
    was estimated at $584,361 and $578,804 as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively, and is based on an estimate of
    interest rates available to the Company for debt with similar
    features, the Company’s current credit

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the
    fair value of tangible net assets and identifiable intangible
    assets of the businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible
    assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized.
    Intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized
    over their useful lives. The Company completed the required
    annual impairment test as of June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    which resulted in no impairment of goodwill.

The Company finalized the purchase accounting for the
    acquisition of D2 Hawkeye, Inc. (“D2”) in the first
    quarter of 2010, and there have been no adjustments since
    December 31, 2009. The Company finalized the purchase
    accounting for the acquisitions of TierMed Systems, LLC
    (“TierMed”) and Enabl-u Technology Corporation as of
    December 31, 2010, which resulted in a decrease in goodwill
    of $51, an increase in current liabilities of $1,047 and an
    increase in intangible assets of $1,098. The Company finalized
    the purchase accounting for the acquisition of Strategic
    Analytics, Inc. (“SA”), which resulted in an increase
    in goodwill of $882 and adjustments to intangible assets,
    current assets, current liabilities, and deferred tax
    liabilities. The impact of these adjustments on the consolidated
    statement of operations is immaterial.

The finalization of the purchase accounting, excluding the final
    resolution of indemnity escrows and contingent consideration,
    for the acquisition of AER during the third quarter of 2009
    resulted in an increase in intangible assets of $3,203, an
    increase in deferred tax liabilities of $885, a decrease in
    accounts payable and accrued expenses of $282, and a
    corresponding decrease to goodwill of $2,600.

The Company recorded an acquisition related liability of $67,200
    for the Xactware acquisition as of December 31, 2008. The
    Company recorded a reduction of $4,300 to goodwill and
    acquisition related liabilities as of March 31, 2009. In
    May 2009, the Company finalized the Xactware acquisition
    contingent liability and made a payment of $62,900. In May 2009,
    the Company also paid the NIA Consulting, LTD (“NIA”)

    comprehensive suite of environmental health and safety
    compliance solutions for a net cash purchase price of
    approximately $99,603 and funded $7,730 of indemnity escrows.
    Within the Company’s Decision Analytics segment, 3E
    overlaps the customer sets served by the other supply chain risk
    management solutions and helps the Company’s customers
    across a variety of vertical markets address their environmental
    health and safety issues.

On December 14, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the
    stock of Crowe Paradis Services Corporation (“CP”), a
    provider of claims analysis and compliance solutions to the
    P&C insurance industry for a net cash purchase price of

    2012, March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2012 for SA, 3E and
    CP, respectively, which was funded into escrow at the close.
    This balance also consists of $1,283 and $485 of noncurrent
    deferred rent and unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. The
    remaining balance consists of contingent consideration of $491,
    which was estimated as of the acquisition date by averaging the
    probability of achieving the specific predetermined EBITDA (as
    defined in Note. 18) of SA and revenue targets, which could
    result in a payment ranging from $0 to $18,000 for the fiscal
    year ending December 31, 2011. The terms of the contingent
    consideration include a range that allows the sellers to benefit
    from the potential growth of SA; however, the amount recorded as
    of the purchase allocation date represents management’s
    best estimate based on the prior financial results as well as
    management’s current best estimate of the future growth of
    revenue and EBITDA. Subsequent changes in the fair value of
    contingent consideration are recorded in operating income in the
    statement of operations. The goodwill associated with these
    acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. Included within
    the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 are revenues of $6,087 and an operating
    loss of $2,259, associated with these acquisitions. For the year
    ended December 31, 2010, the Company incurred legal
    expenses related to these acquisitions of $1,070 included within
    “Selling, general and administrative” expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

    Acquisitions

On October 30, 2009, the Company acquired the net assets of
    Enabl-u, a privately owned provider of data management, training
    and communication solutions to companies with regional, national
    or global work forces, for a net cash purchase price of $2,502
    and the Company funded $136 of indemnity escrows and $100 of
    contingency escrows. The Company believes this acquisition will
    enhance the Company’s ability to provide solutions for
    customers to measure loss prevention and improve asset
    management through the use of software and software services.

On July 24, 2009, the Company acquired the net assets of
    TierMed, a privately owned provider of Healthcare Effectiveness
    Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) solutions to
    healthcare organizations that have HEDIS or quality-reporting
    needs, for a net cash purchase price of $7,230 and the Company
    funded $400 of indemnity escrows. The Company believes this
    acquisition will enhance the Company’s ability to provide
    solutions for customers to measure and improve healthcare
    quality and financial performance through the use of software
    and software services.

On January 14, 2009, the Company acquired 100% of the stock
    of D2, a privately owned provider of data mining, decision
    support, clinical quality analysis, and risk analysis tools for
    the healthcare industry, for a net cash purchase price of
    $51,618 and the Company funded $7,000 of indemnity escrows. The
    Company believes this acquisition will enhance the
    Company’s position in the healthcare analytics and
    predictive modeling market by providing new market, cross-sell,
    and diversification opportunities for the Company’s
    expanding healthcare solutions.

The total net cash purchase price of these three acquisitions
    was $61,350 and the Company funded $7,636 of escrows, of which
    $7,000 and $236 is currently included in “Other current
    assets” and “Other assets,” respectively, in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The allocation of
    purchase price, including working capital adjustments, resulted
    in accounts receivable of $4,435, current assets of $573, fixed
    assets of $2,387, finite lived intangible assets with no
    residual value of $25,265, goodwill of $49,776, current
    liabilities of $4,879, other liabilities of $10,479, and
    deferred tax liabilities of $5,728. Other liabilities consist of
    a $7,236 payment due to the sellers of D2 and Enabl-u at the
    conclusion of the escrows funded at close, assuming no
    pre-acquisition indemnity claims arise subsequent to the
    acquisition date, and $3,344 of contingent consideration, which
    was estimated as of the acquisition date by averaging the
    probability of achieving each of the specific predetermined
    EBITDA and revenue targets, which could result in a payment
    ranging from $0 to $65,700 for the fiscal year ending
    December 31, 2011 for D2. There was no payment for the
    fiscal year ending December 31, 2010 for TierMed. Under
    ASC 805, contingent consideration is recognized at fair
    value at the end of each reporting period. Subsequent changes in
    the fair value of contingent consideration is recorded in the
    statement of operations. For the year ended December 31,
    2009, the Company incurred legal expenses related to these
    acquisitions of $799 included within “Selling, general and
    administrative” expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations.

liability is subject to revisions, which may have a material
    impact on the consolidated financial statements. As the values
    of such assets and liabilities were preliminary in nature in
    2009, they were subject to adjustment as additional information
    was obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as
    of the acquisition date. In accordance with ASC 805, the
    allocation of the purchase price will be finalized once all
    information is obtained, but not to exceed one year from the
    acquisition date. The value of goodwill associated with these
    acquisitions is currently included within the Decision Analytics
    segment. The goodwill for the D2 acquisition is not deductible
    for tax purposes. The goodwill for the TierMed and Enabl-u
    acquisitions are expected to be deductible for tax purposes over
    fifteen years. Included within the consolidated statements of
    operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 are
    revenues of $18,681 and an operating loss of $3,817, associated
    with these acquisitions.

    Acquisitions

In 2008, the Company acquired two entities for an aggregate cash
    purchase price of approximately $19,270 and funded indemnity
    escrows totaling $1,500. At December 31, 2009, these
    escrows have been included in “Other current assets”
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These
    acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method.
    Accordingly, the purchase price, excluding indemnification
    escrows, was allocated to assets acquired based on their
    estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates. Each
    entity’s operating results have been included in the
    Company’s consolidated results from the respective dates of
    acquisition. A description of the two entities purchased in 2008
    is as follows:

On November 20, 2008, the Company acquired 100% of the
    stock of AER. The purchase includes a contingent payment
    provision subject to the achievement of certain predetermined
    financial results for the years ended 2010 and 2011. The
    acquisition of AER further enhances the Company’s
    environmental and scientific research and predictive modeling.
    Excluding the final resolution of indemnity escrows and
    contingent consideration, the Company finalized the purchase
    accounting for AER during the third quarter of 2009, which
    resulted in an increase in intangible assets of $3,203, an
    increase in deferred tax liabilities of $885, a decrease in
    accounts payable and accrued expenses of $282, and a
    corresponding decrease to goodwill of $2,600.

On November 14, 2008, the Company acquired the net assets
    of ZAIO’s two divisions, United Systems Software Company
    and Day One Technology. The assets associated with this
    acquisition further enhance the capability of the Company’s
    appraisal software offerings. The purchase allocation related to
    this acquisition was finalized as of December 31, 2008.

Acquisition
    Contingent Payments

Based on the results of operations of Atmospheric and
    Environmental Research, Inc. (“AER”), which was
    acquired in 2008, the Company recorded an increase of $3,500 to
    acquisition related liabilities and goodwill during the year
    ended December 31, 2010. AER was acquired in 2008 and
    therefore, accounted for under the transition provisions of FASB
    No. 141 (Revised),

Business Combinations

(“FAS No. 141(R)”). As



VERISK
    ANALYTICS, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

such, any adjustments to contingent consideration are recorded
    to goodwill until the final resolution has occurred.

During the third quarter of 2010, the Company reevaluated the
    probability of TierMed achieving the specific predetermined
    EBITDA and revenue targets and reversed its contingent
    consideration related to this acquisition. This revaluation
    resulted in a reduction of $544 to contingent consideration and
    an increase of $544 to “Acquisition related liabilities
    adjustment” in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations during the year ended December 31, 2010. The
    sellers of TierMed will not receive any acquisition contingent
    payments.

A condition of the additional payments for certain of the
    acquisitions is the continued employment of key employees
    resulting in the treatment of such additional payments as
    compensation expense. There were no scheduled acquisition
    contingent payments for which the condition of continuing
    employment was required for the years ended December 31,
    2010 or 2009. Compensation expense related to earnout payments
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $300.

Acquisition
    Escrows

Pursuant to the related acquisition agreements, the Company has
    funded various escrow accounts to satisfy pre-acquisition
    indemnity and tax claims arising subsequent to the acquisition
    date, as well as a portion of the contingent payments. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the current portion of the
    escrows amounted to $6,167 and $20,142, respectively, and has
    been included in “Other current assets” in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company released $13,931 of escrows
    to sellers primarily related to the D2 and Xactware, Inc.
    (“Xactware”) acquisitions. In accordance with
    ASC 805, the escrow related to the D2 acquisition was
    recorded within goodwill at the time of acquisition, as that
    escrow was expected to be released to the sellers. The release
    of $6,935 related to D2 was recorded as a reduction of other
    current assets and a corresponding reduction in accounts payable
    and accrued liabilities. Xactware was acquired in 2006 and
    therefore, accounted for under the transition provisions of
    FAS No. 141(R). As such, the release of $4,996 related
    to Xactware was recorded as a reduction of other current assets
    and a corresponding increase in goodwill. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the noncurrent portion of the escrows amounted to
    $15,953 and $236, respectively.

and when such deferred tax assets are ultimately realized. The
    Company uses tax law ordering for purposes of determining when
    excess tax benefits have been realized.

In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
    was signed into law. The federal government currently provides a
    subsidy on a tax free basis to Companies that provide certain
    retiree prescription drug benefits (Medicare Part D
    Subsidy). As a result of a change in taxability of the federal
    subsidy, the Company recorded a non-cash income tax charge and a
    decrease to the deferred tax asset of $2,362.

As of December 31, 2010 deferred tax liabilities in the
    amount of $810, $20,257 and $15,470 were recorded in connection
    with the acquisitions of SA, CP and 3E, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2009, a deferred tax liability in the amount
    of $5,728 was recorded in connection with the acquisition of D2.
    Excluding the final resolution of indemnity escrows and
    contingent considerations, the Company finalized the purchase
    accounting for D2 during the first quarter of 2010, with no
    changes to deferred taxes since December 31, 2009.

The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends on
    the Company’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income
    in the future.

The Company has provided for a valuation allowance against the
    deferred tax asset associated with the capital loss
    carryforwards expiring in 2012 and the net operating losses of
    certain foreign subsidiaries in Germany and Israel. The
    Company’s net operating loss carryforwards expire as
    follows:

$

44,973

2019-2023


2024-2030

15,396

$

60,805

A valuation allowance has been established based on
    management’s evaluation of the likelihood of utilizing the
    capital loss carryforwards and foreign net operating losses
    before they expire. Management has determined that the
    generation of future German and Israeli taxable income to fully
    realize the deferred tax assets is uncertain. Therefore, a full
    valuation allowance for Israel and a partial valuation allowance
    for Germany have been established. Other than these items,
    management has determined, based on the Company’s
    historical operating performance, that taxable income of the
    Company will more likely than not be sufficient to fully realize
    the deferred tax assets.

In general, it is the practice of the Company to permanently
    reinvest the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries
    in those operations. As of December 31, 2010 the Company
    has not made a provision for U.S. or additional foreign
    withholdings taxes on approximately $4,440 of the unremitted
    earnings. Generally, such amounts become subject to
    U.S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under
    other certain circumstances. It is not practicable to estimate
    the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in
    its foreign subsidiaries.

The Company follows

ASC 740-10,

which prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial
    statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure
    of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
    income tax returns. For each tax position, the Company must
    determine whether it is more likely than not that the position
    will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits
    of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or
    litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not
    recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount
    of benefit to recognize within the

    represent the amount that, if recognized, would have a favorable
    effect on the Company’s effective tax rate in any future
    periods.

The total gross amount of accrued interest and penalties at
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $7,753, $7,384 and
    $8,116, respectively. The Company’s practice is to
    recognize interest and penalties associated with income taxes as
    a component of “Provision for income taxes” in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The Company does not expect a significant increase in
    unrecognized benefits related to state tax exposures within the
    coming year. In addition, the Company believes that it is
    reasonably possible that approximately $4,934 of its currently
    remaining unrecognized tax positions, each of which is
    individually insignificant, may be recognized by the end of 2011
    as a result of a combination of audit settlements and lapses of
    statute of limitations, net of additional uncertain tax
    positions.

The Company is subject to tax in the U.S. and in various
    state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company joined by its
    domestic subsidiaries, files a consolidated income tax return
    for the Federal income tax purposes. With few exceptions, the
    Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and
    local or

non-U.S. income

tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2007.
    In Massachusetts, the Company is being audited for the years
    2003 through 2008 with a statute extension to June 30,
    2011. In New York, the Company is being audited for the years
    2003 through 2006 with a statute extension to June 17,
    2011. The Internal Revenue Service completed an audit for the
    period 2006 through 2007 and have commenced an audit for the
    2008 period. The Company does not expect that the results of
    these examinations will have a material effect on its financial
    position or results of operations.

Syndicated
    Revolving Credit Facility

On July 2, 2009, the Company entered into a $300,000
    syndicated revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A.,
    JPMorgan Chase, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo
    Bank, N.A., which matures on July 2, 2012. Interest is
    payable at maturity at a rate to be determined at the time of
    borrowing. On August 21, 2009, PNC Bank, N.A., Sovereign
    Bank, RBS Citizens, N.A., and SunTrust Bank joined the
    syndicated revolving credit facility increasing the availability
    to $420,000. This facility is committed with a one-time fee of
    $4,510, which will be amortized over a three year period.

On September 10, 2010, the Company amended its syndicated
    revolving credit facility to increase the capacity by $155,000
    to $575,000, to extend the maturity of the syndicated revolving
    credit facility to September 10, 2014 and to modify certain
    restrictions. The Company paid a one-time fee of $1,781, which
    will be amortized over a four-year period, consistent with the
    remaining life of the credit facility, reduced the ongoing
    unused facility fees from 0.375% to 0.200% and reduced the
    borrowing rate from LIBOR plus 2.50% to LIBOR plus 1.75%. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had $310,000 and
    $60,000 outstanding under this agreement. As of

    borrowings under the syndicated revolving credit facility is
    payable at a weighted average interest rate of 2.10% and 2.73%,
    respectively.

Redeemable
    Common Stock:

Prior to the corporate reorganization on October 6, 2009,
    the Company followed

ASC 480-10-S99-1,

Presentation in Financial Statements of Preferred Redeemable
    Stock

(“ASC

480-10-S99-1”).

ASC 480-10-S99-1

required the Company to record ISO Class A common stock and
    vested stock options at full redemption value at each balance
    sheet date as the redemption of these securities was not solely
    within the control of the Company. Subsequent changes to the
    redemption value of the securities was charged first to retained
    earnings; once retained earnings was depleted, then to
    additional

paid-in-capital,

and if additional

paid-in-capital

was also depleted, then to accumulated deficit. Redemption value
    for the ISO Class A stock was determined quarterly on or
    about the final day of the quarter for purposes of the KSOP.
    Prior to September 30, 2009, the valuation methodology was
    based on a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors
    including the nature of the business and history of the
    enterprise, the economic outlook in general and the condition of
    the specific industries in which the Company operates, the
    financial condition of the business, the Company’s ability
    to generate free cash flow, and goodwill or other intangible
    asset value. This determination of the fair market value
    employed both a comparable public company analysis, which
    examines the valuation multiples of companies deemed comparable,
    in whole or in part, to the Company, and a discounted cash flow
    analysis that determined a present value of the projected future
    cash flows of the business. The Company regularly assessed the
    underlying assumptions used in the valuation methodologies. As a
    result, the Company had utilized this quarterly fair value for
    all its ISO Class A redeemable common stock transactions,
    as required by terms of the KSOP and the Option Plan. The fourth
    quarter 2008 valuation was finalized on December 31, 2008,
    which resulted in a fair value per share of $15.56. The fair
    value calculated for the



VERISK
    ANALYTICS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

second quarter 2009 was $17.78 per share and was used for all
    ISO Class A stock transactions for the three months ended
    September 30, 2009. At September 30, 2009, the
    Company’s fair value per share used was determined based on
    the subsequent observable IPO price of $22.00 on October 7,
    2009. The use of the IPO price rather than the valuation
    methodology described above was based on the short period of
    time between September 30, 2009 and the IPO date.

In connection with the corporate reorganization on
    October 6, 2009, the Company is no longer obligated to
    redeem ISO Class A shares and is therefore no longer
    required to record the ISO Class A stock and vested stock
    options at redemption value under

ASC 480-10-S99-1.

The redemption value of the ISO Class A redeemable common
    stock and vested options at intrinsic value at October 6,
    2009 and December 31, 2008 totaled $1,064,896 and $752,912,
    which includes $299,983 and $172,408, respectively, of aggregate
    intrinsic value of outstanding unexercised vested stock options.
    The reversal of the redeemable common stock balance is first
    applied against accumulated deficit; once the accumulated
    deficit is depleted, then to additional

paid-in-capital

up to the amount equal to the additional

paid-in-capital

of the Company as if

ASC 480-10-S99-1

was never required to be adopted. Any remaining balance is
    credited to retained earnings. The reversal of the redeemable
    common stock of $1,064,896 on October 6, 2009 resulted in
    the elimination of accumulated deficit of $440,584, an increase
    of $30 to Class A common stock at par value, an increase of
    $624,282 to additional

paid-in-capital,

and a reclassification of the ISO Class A unearned common
    stock KSOP shares balance of $1,305 to unearned KSOP
    contributions. See Note 16 for further discussion.

During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    3,032,850 and 25,121,750 of ISO Class A shares were
    redeemed by the Company at a weighted average price of $16.18
    and $17.28 per share, respectively. Included in ISO Class A
    repurchased shares were $805 and $19,734 for shares primarily
    utilized to satisfy minimum tax withholdings on options
    exercised during the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

Stockholders’
    Deficit:

On November 18, 1996, the Company authorized
    335,000,000 shares of ISO Class A redeemable common
    stock. Effective with the corporate reorganization on
    October 6, 2009, the ISO Class A redeemable common
    stock and all Verisk Class B shares sold into the IPO were
    converted to Verisk Class A common stock on a

one-for-one

basis. In addition, the Verisk Class A common stock
    authorized was increased to 1,200,000,000 shares. The
    Verisk Class A common shares have rights to any dividend
    declared by the board of directors, subject to any preferential
    or other rights of any outstanding preferred stock, and voting
    rights to elect eight of the eleven members of the board of
    directors. The eleventh seat on the board of directors is held
    by the CEO of the Company.

On November 18, 1996, the Company authorized 1,000,000,000
    ISO Class B shares and issued 500,225,000 shares. On
    October 6, 2009, the Company completed a corporate
    reorganization whereby the ISO Class B common stock and
    treasury stock was converted to Verisk Class B common stock
    on a

one-for-one



VERISK
    ANALYTICS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

basis. All Verisk Class B shares sold into the IPO were
    converted to Verisk Class A common stock on a

one-for-one

basis. In addition, the Verisk Class B common stock
    authorized was reduced to 800,000,000 shares,

sub-divided

into 400,000,000 shares of

Class B-1

and 400,000,000 of

Class B-2.

Each share of

Class B-1

common stock shall convert automatically, without any action by
    the stockholder, into one share of Verisk Class A common
    stock on April 6, 2011. Each share of

Class B-2

common stock shall convert automatically, without any action by
    the stockholder, into one share of Verisk Class A common
    stock on October 6, 2011. The Class B shares have the
    same rights as Verisk Class A shares with respect to
    dividends and economic ownership, but have voting rights to
    elect three of the eleven directors. The Company did not
    repurchase any Class B shares during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The Company repurchased 483,500 ISO
    Class B shares at an average price of $10.34 during the
    year ended December 31, 2008.

On October 6, 2009, the Company authorized
    80,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per
    shares, in connection with the reorganization. The preferred
    shares have preferential rights over the Verisk Class A,

Class B-1

and

Class B-2

common shares with respect to dividends and net distribution
    upon liquidation. The Company did not issue any preferred shares
    from the reorganization date through December 31, 2010.

Treasury
    Stock

As of December 31, 2010, the Company’s treasury stock
    consisted of 7,111,202 Class A common stock, 186,102,482

Class B-1

common stock and 178,893,668

Class B-2

common stock. The Company’s

Class B-1

and

Class B-2

treasury stock will convert to Class A common stock
    consistent with the

Class B-1

and

Class B-2

common stock.

Share
    Repurchase Program

On April 29, 2010, the Company’s board of directors
    authorized a $150,000 share repurchase program of the
    Company’s common stock (the “Repurchase
    Program”). On October 19, 2010, the Company’s
    board of directors authorized an additional $150,000 of share
    repurchases under the Repurchase Program. Under the Repurchase
    Program, the Company may repurchase stock in the open market or
    as otherwise determined by the Company. The Company has no
    obligation to repurchase stock under this program and intends to
    use this authorization as a means of offsetting dilution from
    the issuance of shares under the KSOP, the Verisk Analytics,
    Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”)
    and the Insurance Services Office, Inc. 1996 Incentive Plan (the
    “Option Plan”). This authorization has no expiration
    date and may be suspended or terminated at any time. Repurchased
    shares will be recorded as treasury stock and will be available
    for future issuance as part of the Repurchase Program.

During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    7,111,202 shares of Verisk Class A common stock were
    repurchased by the Company as part of this program at a weighted
    average price of $29.88 per share. The Company utilized
    borrowings from its syndicated revolving credit facility to fund
    these repurchases. As treasury stock purchases are recorded
    based on trade date, the Company has included $2,266 in
    “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets for those purchases
    that have not settled as of December 31, 2010. The Company
    had $87,488 available to repurchase shares under the Repurchase
    Program as of December 31, 2010.

The Company repurchased 7,583,532 and 374,718 Verisk

Class B-1

and

Class B-2 shares,

respectively, at an average price of $26.3644 during the year
    ended December 31, 2010. These repurchases were separately
    authorized and did not affect the availability under the
    Repurchase Program.

Earnings
    Per Share

As disclosed in “Note 1 — Organization”
    on October 6, 2009 Verisk became the new parent holding
    company for ISO. In connection with the IPO, the stock of ISO
    was exchanged for the stock of Verisk on a

one-for-one

basis and Verisk effected a

fifty-for-one

stock split of its Verisk Class A and Class B common



VERISK

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

stock. As a result of the stock split, all share and per share
    data throughout this report has been adjusted to reflect a

fifty-for-one

stock split.

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
    available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
    of common shares outstanding during the period less the weighted
    average Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) shares
    of common stock that have not been committed to be released. The
    computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of
    basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include
    the number of additional common shares that would have been
    outstanding, using the treasury stock method, if the dilutive
    potential common shares, such as stock awards and stock options,
    had been issued.

The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and
    denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

16.  Compensation
    Plans:

KSOP

The Company has established the KSOP for the benefit of eligible
    employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The KSOP includes
    both an employee savings component and an employee stock
    ownership component. The purpose of the combined plan is to
    enable the Company’s employees to participate in a
    tax-deferred savings arrangement under Code Sections 401(a)
    and 401(k), and to provide employee equity participation in the
    Company through the ESOP accounts.

Under the KSOP, eligible employees may make pre-tax and
    after-tax cash contributions as a percentage of their
    compensation, subject to certain limitations under the
    applicable provisions of the Code. The maximum pre-tax
    contribution that can be made to the 401(k) account as
    determined under the provisions of Code Section 401(g) is
    $17, $17 and $16 for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Certain
    eligible participants (age 50 and older) may contribute an
    additional $6, $6 and $5 on a pre-tax basis for 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. After-tax contributions are
    limited to 10% of a participant’s compensation. The Company
    provides quarterly matching contributions in Class A common
    stock. The quarterly matching contributions are equal to 75% of
    the first 6% of the participant’s contribution.

The Company established the ESOP component as a funding vehicle
    for the KSOP. This leveraged ESOP acquired
    57,190,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common
    stock at a cost of approximately $33,170 ($0.58 per share) in
    January 1997. The ESOP borrowed $33,170 from an unrelated third
    party to finance the purchase of the KSOP shares. The common
    shares were pledged as collateral for its debt. The Company made
    annual cash contributions to the KSOP equal to the ESOP’s
    debt service. As the debt was repaid, shares were released from
    collateral and were allocated to active employees in proportion
    to their annual salaries in relation to total participant
    salaries. The Company accounts for its ESOP in accordance with

ASC 718-40,

Employee Stock Ownership Plans

(“ASC

718-40”)

and

ASC 480-10,

Distinguishing Liabilities

(“ASC

As shares were committed to be released from collateral, the
    Company reported compensation expense at the then-current fair
    value of the shares, and the shares became outstanding for EPS
    computations.

In 2004, the Company renegotiated the ESOP loan to require
    interest only payments for the third and fourth quarters of
    2004. In December 2004, the Company repaid the ESOP loan and
    issued a new loan agreement between the Company and the KSOP,
    thereby extending the allocation of the remaining unreleased
    shares as of July 1, 2004 through 2013.

On October 6, 2009, the Company accelerated the release of
    2,623,600 shares to the ESOP account. This resulted in a
    non-recurring non-cash charge of $57,720 in October 2009, which
    will primarily be non-deductible for tax purposes.

Effective with the IPO, the KSOP trustee sold
    5,000,000 shares of Verisk Class A common stock, of
    which 2,754,600 shares were released-unallocated shares and
    2,245,400 were unreleased shares pledged as collateral against
    the intercompany ESOP loan. The sale of the released-unallocated
    shares resulted in cash proceeds to the KSOP of $58,177. The
    sale of the unreleased shares resulted in cash proceeds to the
    KSOP of $47,423, all of which is pledged as collateral against
    the intercompany ESOP loan. The cash proceeds received by the
    KSOP can be used to repurchase shares diversified or distributed
    by KSOP participants subsequent to the IPO. All shares
    repurchased during this period will be repurchased first from
    the cash proceeds from the sale of the released-unallocated
    shares; once these proceeds are depleted and replaced with
    shares of Verisk Class A common stock, then all further
    share diversifications or distributions will be repurchased from
    the proceeds received from the sale of the unreleased shares. In
    accordance with

ASC 718-40,

the balance of the Class A common stock unearned KSOP
    shares was reclassified from redeemable common stock to
    “Unearned KSOP contributions”, a contra-equity account
    within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As the
    intercompany ESOP loan is repaid, a percentage of the ESOP loan
    collateral will be released and allocated to active participants
    in proportion to their annual salaries in relation to total
    participant salaries. As of December 31, 2010, the
    intercompany ESOP loan collateral consisted of cash equivalents
    totaling $669 and 1,242,481 shares of Verisk Class A
    common stock valued at $42,344. As of December 31, 2010,
    the Company had 20,237,069 and 47,355 allocated and
    released-unallocated ESOP shares, respectively.

In 2005, the Company established the ISO Profit Sharing Plan
    (the “Profit Sharing Plan”), a defined contribution
    plan, to replace the pension plan for all eligible employees
    hired on or after March 1, 2005. The Profit Sharing Plan is
    a component of the KSOP. Eligible employees will participate in
    the Profit Sharing Plan if they complete 1,000 hours of
    service each plan year and are employed on December 31 of that
    year. The Company will make an annual contribution to the Profit
    Sharing Plan based on the Company’s performance.
    Participants vest once they have completed four years and
    1,000 hours of service. For all periods presented, the
    profit sharing contribution was funded using Class A common
    stock.

Prior to the IPO, the fair value of the Class A shares was
    determined quarterly as determined for purposes of the KSOP. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the fair value was $34.08 and
    $30.28 per share, respectively. KSOP compensation expense for
    2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $11,573, $76,065 and
    $22,274, respectively.

Stock
    Option Plan

All of the Company’s outstanding stock options are covered
    under the Incentive Plan or the Option Plan. Awards under the
    Incentive Plan may include one or more of the following types:
    (i) stock options (both nonqualified and incentive stock
    options), (ii) stock appreciation rights,
    (iii) restricted stock, (iv) restricted stock units,
    (v) performance awards, (vi) other share-based awards,
    and (vii) cash. Employees, directors and consultants are
    eligible for awards under the Incentive Plan. Cash received from
    stock option exercises for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008 was $35,482, $7,709 and $892, respectively.
    On April 1, 2010 and June 1, 2010, the Company granted
    2,011,390 and 5,000, respectively, of nonqualified stock options



VERISK
    ANALYTICS, INC.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

to key employees with an exercise price equal to the closing
    price of the Company’s Class A common stock on
    March 31, 2010 and May 28, 2010, with a ten-year
    contractual term and a service vesting period of four years. On
    July 1, 2010, the Company granted 31,906 nonqualified stock
    options that were immediately vested, 138,120 nonqualified stock
    options with a one-year service vesting period and
    4,554 shares of Class A common stock, to the directors
    of the Company. The stock options have an exercise price equal
    to the closing price of the Company’s Class A common
    stock on the grant date and a ten-year contractual term. As of
    December 31, 2010, there are 8,683,159 shares of
    Class A common stock reserved and available for future
    issuance.

The fair value of the stock options granted during the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were estimated on
    the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model
    that uses the weighted-average assumptions noted in the

The expected term for a majority of the awards granted was
    estimated based on studies of historical experience and
    projected exercise behavior. However, for certain awards
    granted, for which no historical exercise pattern exist, the
    expected term was estimated using the simplified method. The
    risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of
    U.S. Treasury zero coupon securities with a maturity equal
    to the expected term of the equity award. The volatility factor
    was based on the average volatility of the Company’s peers,
    calculated using historical daily closing prices over the most
    recent period that commensurates with the expected term of the
    stock option award. The expected dividend yield was based on the
    Company’s expected annual dividend rate on the date of
    grant.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Intrinsic value for stock options is calculated based on the
    exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of
    Verisk’s common stock as of the reporting date. The
    aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and
    exercisable at December 31, 2010 was $478,014 and $368,466,
    respectively. In accordance with ASC 718, excess tax
    benefit from exercised stock options is recorded as an increase
    to additional-paid-in capital and a corresponding reduction in
    taxes payable. This tax benefit is calculated as the excess of
    the intrinsic value of options exercised in excess of
    compensation recognized for financial reporting purposes. The
    amount of the tax benefit that has been realized, as a result of
    those excess tax benefits, is presented in the statement of cash
    flows as a financing cash inflow.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, certain employees
    exercised stock options and covered the statutory minimum tax
    withholdings of $15,051 through a net settlement of
    503,043 shares. The payment of taxes related to these
    exercises were recorded as a reduction to additional-paid-in
    capital. This transaction is reflected within “Net share
    settlement of taxes upon exercise of stock options” within
    cash flows from financing activities in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Company estimates expected forfeitures of equity awards at
    the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense only for
    those awards that the Company expects to vest. The forfeiture
    assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate.
    Changes in the forfeiture assumptions may impact the total
    amount of expense ultimately recognized over the requisite
    service period and may impact the timing of expense recognized
    over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation
    expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $21,298, $12,744 and $9,881,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, there was $39,920 of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
    compensation arrangements granted under the Incentive Plan and
    the Option Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 3.0 years. As of
    December 31, 2010, there were 8,237,410 nonvested stock
    options, of which 7,094,840 are expected to vest. The total
    grant date fair value of options vested during the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $17,677, $9,918 and
    $11,803, respectively.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits:

Prior to January 1, 2002, the Company maintained a
    qualified defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of
    its employees through membership in the Pension Plan for
    Insurance Organizations (the “Pension Plan”), a
    multiple-employer trust. The Company has applied the projected
    unit credit cost method for its pension plan, which attributes
    an equal portion of total projected benefits to each year of
    employee service. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company
    amended the Pension Plan to determine future benefits using a
    cash balance formula. Under the cash balance formula, each
    participant has an account, which is credited annually based on
    salary rates determined by years of service, as well as the
    interest earned on their previous year-end cash balance. Prior
    to December 31, 2001, pension plan benefits were based on
    years of service and the average of the five highest consecutive
    years’ earnings of the last ten years. Effective
    March 1, 2005, the Company established the Profit Sharing
    Plan, a defined contribution plan, to replace the Pension Plan
    for all eligible employees hired on or after March 1, 2005.
    The Company also has a non-qualified supplemental cash balance
    plan (“SERP”) for certain employees. The SERP is
    funded from the general assets of the Company.

The Pension Plan’s funding policy is to contribute annually
    at an amount between the minimum funding requirements set forth
    in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the
    maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax
    purposes. The Company contributed $313, $292 and $542 to
    the SERP in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and expects to
    contribute $533 in 2011. The minimum required funding for the
    Pension Plan for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008 was $20,444, $5,471 and $5,029, respectively. The
    Company expects to contribute $25,312 to the Pension Plan in
    2011.

The expected return on the plan assets for 2010 and 2009 is
    8.25%, which is determined by taking into consideration the
    Company’s analysis of its actual historical investment
    returns to a broader long-term



VERISK
    ANALYTICS, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

forecast adjusted based on the its target investment allocation,
    and the current economic environment. The Company’s
    investment guidelines target investment allocation of 60% equity
    securities and 40% debt securities. The Pension Plan assets
    consist primarily of investments in various fixed income and
    equity funds. Investment guidelines are established with each
    investment manager. These guidelines provide the parameters
    within which the investment managers agree to operate, including
    criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities,
    diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where
    applicable. Investment managers are prohibited from entering
    into any speculative hedging transactions. The investment
    objective is to achieve a maximum total return with strong
    emphasis on preservation of capital in real terms. The domestic
    equity portion of the total portfolio should range between 40%
    and 60%. The international equity portion of the total portfolio
    should range between 10% and 20%. The fixed income portion of
    the total portfolio should range between 20% and 40%. The asset
    allocation at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and target
    allocation for 2011 by asset category are as follows:

The Company has used the target investment allocation to derive
    the expected return as the Company believes this allocation will
    be retained on an ongoing basis that will commensurate with the
    projected cash flows of the plan. The expected return for each
    investment category within the target investment allocation is
    developed using average historical rates of return for each
    targeted investment category, considering the projected cash
    flow of the pension plan. The difference between this expected
    return and the actual return on plan assets is generally
    deferred and recognized over subsequent periods through future
    net periodic benefit costs. The Company believes that the use of
    the average historical rates of returns is consistent with the
    timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and
    benefit payments to plan participants. The Company believes that
    these considerations provide the basis for reasonable
    assumptions with respect to the expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets.

The Company also provides certain healthcare and life insurance
    benefits for both active and retired employees. The
    Postretirement Health and Life Insurance Plan (the
    “Postretirement Plan”) is contributory, requiring
    participants to pay a stated percentage of the premium for
    coverage. As of October 1, 2001, the Postretirement Plan
    was amended to freeze benefits for current retirees and certain
    other employees at the January 1, 2002 level. Also, as of
    October 1, 2001, the Postretirement Plan had a curtailment,
    which eliminated retiree life insurance for all active employees
    and healthcare benefits for almost all future retirees,
    effective January 1, 2002. The Company expects to
    contribute $4,227 to the Postretirement Plan in 2011.

Segment
    Reporting

ASC

280-10,

Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information

(“ASC

280-10”),

establishes standards for reporting information about operating
    segments.

ASC 280-10

requires that a public business enterprise report financial and
    descriptive information about its reportable operating segments.
    Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which
    separate financial information is available that is evaluated
    regularly by the chief operating decision maker
    (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in
    assessing performance. The Company’s CEO and Chairman of
    the Board is identified as the CODM as defined by

ASC 280-10.

To align with the internal management of the Company’s
    business operations based on service offerings, the Company is
    organized into the following two operating segments, which are
    also the Company’s reportable segments:

Risk Assessment:

The Company is the
    leading provider of statistical, actuarial and underwriting data
    for the U.S. P&C insurance industry. The
    Company’s databases include cleansed and standardized
    records describing premiums and losses in insurance
    transactions, casualty and property risk attributes for
    commercial buildings and their occupants and fire suppression
    capabilities of municipalities. The Company uses this data to
    create policy language and proprietary risk classifications that
    are industry standards and to generate prospective loss cost
    estimates used to price insurance policies.

Decision Analytics:

The Company
    develops solutions that its customers use to analyze the three
    key processes in managing risk: ‘loss prediction,’
    ‘fraud identification and detection’ and ‘loss
    quantification.’ The Company’s combination of
    algorithms and analytic methods incorporates its proprietary
    data to generate solutions in each of these three categories. In
    most cases, the Company’s customers integrate the solutions
    into their models, formulas or underwriting criteria in order to
    predict potential loss events, ranging from hurricanes and
    earthquakes to unanticipated healthcare claims. The Company
    develops catastrophe and extreme event models and offers
    solutions covering natural and man-made risks, including acts of
    terrorism. The Company also develops solutions that allow
    customers to quantify costs after loss events occur. Fraud
    solutions include data on claim histories, analysis of mortgage
    applications to identify misinformation, analysis of claims to
    find emerging patterns of fraud, and identification of
    suspicious claims in the insurance, mortgage and healthcare
    sectors.

The two aforementioned operating segments represent the segments
    for which separate discrete financial information is available
    and upon which operating results are regularly evaluated by the
    CODM in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The
    Company uses segment EBITDA as the profitability measure for
    making decisions regarding ongoing operations. Segment EBITDA is
    income from continuing operations before investment income and
    interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization,
    and



VERISK
    ANALYTICS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

acquisition related liabilities adjustment. Segment EBITDA is
    the measure of operating results used to assess corporate
    performance and optimal utilization of debt and acquisitions.
    Segment operating expenses consist of direct and indirect costs
    principally related to personnel, facilities, software license
    fees, consulting, travel, and third-party information services.
    Indirect costs are generally allocated to the segments using
    fixed rates established by management based upon estimated
    expense contribution levels and other assumptions that
    management considers reasonable. The Company does not allocate
    investment income, realized gains/(losses) on securities, net,
    interest expense, or income tax expense, since these items are
    not considered in evaluating the segment’s overall
    operating performance. The CODM does not evaluate the financial
    performance of each segment based on assets. On a geographic
    basis, no individual country outside of the U.S. accounted
    for 1% or more of the Company’s consolidated revenue for
    any of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. No
    individual country outside of the U.S. accounted for 1% or
    more of total consolidated long-term assets as of
    December 31, 2010 or 2009.

The following tables provide the Company’s revenue and
    operating income performance by reportable segment for the year
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, as well as a
    reconciliation to income before income taxes for all periods

Related Party Disclosures

. At
    December 31, 2010, the related parties were four
    Class B stockholders each owning more than 5% of the
    outstanding Class B shares compared to six Class B
    stockholders at December 31, 2009. At December 31,
    2010, there were four Class A stockholders owning more than
    5% of the outstanding Class A shares. The Company’s
    related parties had accounts receivable, net of $515 and $1,353
    and fees received in advance of $1,231 and $439 as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, the
    Company had revenues from related parties for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $49,788, $60,192 and

Most of the leases require payment of property taxes and
    utilities and, in certain cases, contain renewal options.
    Operating leases consist of office space. Capital leases consist
    of computer equipment, office equipment, and leased automobiles.
    Rent expense on operating leases approximated $23,898, $22,985
    and $21,261 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In addition, the Company is a party to legal proceedings with
    respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of
    business, including those matters described below. The Company
    is unable, at the present time, to determine the ultimate
    resolution of or provide a reasonable estimate of the range of
    possible loss attributable to these matters or the impact they
    may have on the Company’s results of operations, financial
    position or cash flows. This is primarily because many of these
    cases remain in their early stages and only limited discovery
    has taken place. Although the Company believes it has strong
    defenses for the litigation proceedings described below, the
    Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into
    settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect
    on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Claims
    Outcome Advisor Litigation

Hensley, et al. v. Computer Sciences Corporation et al.

was a putative nationwide class action complaint, filed in
    February 2005, in Miller County, Arkansas state court.
    Defendants include numerous insurance companies and providers of
    software products used by insurers in paying claims. The Company
    is among the named defendants. Plaintiffs allege that certain
    software products, including the Company’s Claims Outcome
    Advisor product and a competing software product sold by
    Computer Sciences Corporation, improperly estimated the amount
    to be paid by insurers to their policyholders in connection with
    claims for bodily injuries.

The Company entered into settlement agreements with plaintiffs
    asserting claims relating to the use of Claims Outcome Advisor
    by defendants Hanover Insurance Group, Progressive Car Insurance
    and Liberty Mutual Insurance Group. Each of these settlements
    was granted final approval by the court and together the
    settlements resolve the claims asserted in this case against the
    Company with respect to the above insurance companies, who
    settled the claims against them as well. A provision was made in
    2006 for this proceeding and the total amount the Company paid
    in 2008 with respect to these settlements was less than $2,000.
    A fourth defendant, The Automobile Club of California, which is
    alleged to have used Claims Outcome Advisor, was dismissed from
    the action. On August 18, 2008, pursuant to the agreement
    of the parties the Court ordered that the claims against the
    Company be dismissed with prejudice.

Subsequently, Hanover Insurance Group made a demand for
    reimbursement, pursuant to an indemnification provision
    contained in a December 30, 2004 License Agreement between
    Hanover and the Company, of its settlement and defense costs in
    the

Hensley

class action. Specifically, Hanover demanded
    $2,536 including $600 in attorneys’ fees and expenses. The
    Company disputes that Hanover is entitled to any reimbursement
    pursuant to the License Agreement. In July 2010, after the
    Company and Hanover were unable to resolve the dispute in
    mediation, Hanover served a summons and complaint seeking
    indemnity and contribution from the Company. At this time, it is
    not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of or estimate
    the liability related to this matter.

Xactware
    Litigation

The following two lawsuits have been filed by or on behalf of
    groups of Louisiana insurance policyholders who claim, among
    other things, that certain insurers who used products and price
    information supplied by the Company’s Xactware subsidiary
    (and those of another provider) did not fully compensate
    policyholders for property damage covered under their insurance
    policies. The plaintiffs seek to recover compensation for their
    damages in an amount equal to the difference between the amount
    paid by the defendants and the fair market repair/restoration
    costs of their damaged property.

Schafer v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co.

,

et al.

was a putative class action pending against the
    Company and State Farm Fire & Casualty Company filed
    in March 2007 in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The
    complaint alleged antitrust violations, breach of contract,
    negligence, bad faith, and fraud. The court dismissed the
    antitrust claim as to both defendants and dismissed all claims
    against the Company other than fraud, which will proceed to the
    discovery phase along with the remaining claims against State
    Farm. Judge Duval denied plaintiffs’ motion to certify a
    class with respect to the fraud and breach of contract claims on
    August 3, 2009 and the time to appeal that decision has
    expired. The matter, now a single action, was reassigned to
    Judge Africk. Plaintiffs agreed to settle the matter with the
    Company and State Farm and a Settlement Agreement and Release
    was executed by all parties in June 2010.

Mornay v. Travelers Ins. Co.

,

et al.

is a
    putative class action pending against the Company and Travelers
    Insurance Company filed in November 2007 in the Eastern District
    of Louisiana. The complaint alleged antitrust violations, breach
    of contract, negligence, bad faith, and fraud. As in Schafer,
    the court dismissed the antitrust claim as to both defendants
    and dismissed all claims against the Company other than fraud.
    Judge Duval stayed all proceedings in the case pending an
    appraisal of the lead plaintiff’s insurance claim. The
    matter has been re-assigned to Judge Barbier, who on
    September 11, 2009 issued an order administratively closing
    the matter pending completion of the appraisal process. At this
    time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate resolution of
    or estimate the liability related to this matter.

iiX
    Litigation

In March 2007, the Company’s subsidiary, Insurance
    Information Exchange, or iiX, as well as other information
    providers and insurers in the State of Texas, were served with a
    summons and class action complaint filed in the United States
    District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging
    violations of the Driver Privacy Protection Act, or the DPPA,
    entitled

Sharon Taylor, et al. v. Acxiom Corporation, et
    al

. Plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and on
    behalf of all similarly situated individuals whose personal
    information is contained in any motor vehicle record maintained
    by the State of Texas and who have not provided express consent
    to the State of Texas for the distribution of their personal
    information for purposes not enumerated by the DPPA and whose
    personal information has been knowingly obtained and used by the
    defendants. The class complaint alleges that the defendants
    knowingly obtained personal information for a purpose not
    authorized by the DPPA and seeks liquidated damages in the
    amount of two thousand five hundred dollars for each instance of
    a violation of the DPPA, punitive damages and the destruction of
    any illegally obtained personal information. The Court granted
    iiX’s motion to dismiss the complaint based on failure to
    state a claim and for lack of standing. Oral arguments on the
    plaintiffs’ appeal of that dismissal were held on
    November 4, 2009. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth
    Circuit Court affirmed the District

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Court’s dismissal of the complaint on July 14, 2010.
    Plaintiffs filed a petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the
    United States Supreme Court on October 12, 2010, which was
    denied on January 10, 2011.

Similarly, in April 2010, the Company’s subsidiary, iiX, as
    well as other information providers in the State of Missouri
    were served with a summons and class action complaint filed in
    the United States District Court for the Western District of
    Missouri alleging violations of the Driver Privacy Protection
    Act, or the DPPA, entitled

Janice Cook, et al. v. ACS
    State & Local Solutions, et al.

Plaintiffs brought
    the action on their own behalf and on behalf of all similarly
    situated individuals whose personal information is contained in
    any motor vehicle record maintained by the State of Missouri and
    who have not provided express consent to the State of Missouri
    for the distribution of their personal information for purposes
    not enumerated by the DPPA and whose personal information has
    been knowingly obtained and used by the defendants. The class
    complaint alleges that the defendants knowingly obtained
    personal information for a purpose not authorized by the DPPA
    and seeks liquidated damages in the amount of two thousand five
    hundred dollars for each instance of a violation of the DDPA,
    punitive damages and the destruction of any illegally obtained
    personal information. The court granted iiX’s motion to
    dismiss the complaint based on a failure to state a claim on
    November 19, 2010. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on
    December 17, 2010.

At this time, it is not possible to determine the ultimate
    resolution of or estimate the liability related to these matters.

Interthinx
    Litigation

In September 2009, the Company’s subsidiary, Interthinx,
    Inc., was served with a putative class action entitled

Renata
    Gluzman v. Interthinx, Inc.

The plaintiff, a former
    Interthinx employee, filed the class action on August 13,
    2009 in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of
    Los Angeles on behalf of all Interthinx information technology
    employees for unpaid overtime and missed meals and rest breaks,
    as well as various related claims claiming that the information
    technology employees were misclassified as exempt employees and,
    as a result, were denied certain wages and benefits that would
    have been received if they were properly classified as
    non-exempt employees. The pleadings include, among other things,
    a violation of Business and Professions Code 17200 for unfair
    business practices, which allows plaintiffs to include as class
    members all information technology employees employed at
    Interthinx for four years prior to the date of filing the
    complaint. The complaint seeks compensatory damages, penalties
    that are associated with the various statutes, restitution,
    interest costs, and attorney fees. On June 2, 2010,
    Plaintiffs agreed to settle their claims with Interthinx. The
    court granted preliminary approval to the settlement on
    November 10, 2010 and scheduled the final approval hearing
    for February 23, 2011.
