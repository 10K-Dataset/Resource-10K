PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

United Technologies Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1934. UTC provides high technology products and services to the building systems and
aerospace industries worldwide. Growth is attributable to acquisitions and the internal development of our existing businesses. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2008 Annual Report, especially the information contained therein under the heading “Business Overview.”

Our operating units include businesses with operations throughout the world. Otis, Carrier and UTC Fire & Security (collectively referred to as
the commercial businesses) serve customers in the commercial and residential property industries worldwide. Carrier also serves commercial, industrial, transport refrigeration and food service equipment customers. Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton
Sundstrand and Sikorsky (collectively referred to as the aerospace businesses) primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry. Hamilton
Sundstrand and Pratt & Whitney also serve customers in certain industrial markets. For 2008, our commercial and industrial revenues (generated principally by our commercial businesses) were approximately 62 percent of our consolidated
revenues, and commercial aerospace and military aerospace revenues were approximately 21 percent and 17 percent, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Revenues for 2008 from outside the United States, including U.S. export sales, were 64
percent of our total segment revenues.

This Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all
amendments to those reports are available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our Internet website (http://www.utc.com) under the heading “SEC Filings” as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are
electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our SEC filings are also available for reading and copying at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on
the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) containing reports, proxy and information statements, and other information

Description of Business by Segment

We conduct our business through six principal segments: Otis, Carrier, UTC Fire & Security, Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand and
Sikorsky. Each segment groups similar operating companies and the management organization of each segment has general operating autonomy over a range of products and services. The principal products and services of each segment are as follows:

UTC is in the process of incorporating UTC Power’s combined cooling, heating and power
systems business within Carrier’s businesses, its geothermal power systems business within Pratt & Whitney’s power systems business, and its space and defense fuel cell power plant business within Hamilton Sundstrand’s
energy, space and defense business. These transitions are expected to be completed during the first half of 2009.

Segment financial data
for the years 2006 through 2008, including financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales, appears in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008 Annual Report.

Otis

Otis is the world’s largest elevator and
escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Otis designs, manufactures, sells and installs a wide range of passenger and freight elevators for low-, medium- and high-speed applications, as well as a broad line of escalators and moving
walkways. In addition to new equipment, Otis provides modernization products to upgrade elevators and escalators as well as maintenance services for both its products and those of other manufacturers. Otis serves customers in the commercial and
residential property industries around the world. Otis sells directly to the end customer and, to a limited extent, through sales representatives and distributors.

Revenues generated by Otis’ international operations were 80 percent and 81 percent of total Otis segment revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008, Otis’ backlog was $15,025 million
as compared to $14,146 million at December 31, 2007. Of the total Otis backlog at December 31, 2008, approximately $8,476 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2009.

Carrier

Carrier is the world’s largest manufacturer and distributor of HVAC and refrigeration
systems. It also produces food service equipment and HVAC and refrigeration-related controls for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation applications. Carrier also provides installation, retrofit and aftermarket services and
components for the products it sells and those of other manufacturers in the HVAC and refrigeration industries. Carrier’s products and services are sold under Carrier and other brand names to building contractors and owners, homeowners,
transportation companies, retail stores and food service companies. Carrier sells directly to the end customer and through manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, wholesalers, dealers and retail outlets. Certain of Carrier’s HVAC
businesses are seasonal and can be impacted by weather. Carrier customarily offers its customers incentives to purchase products to ensure an adequate supply of its products in the distribution channels.



Revenues generated by Carrier’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 60
percent and 59 percent of total Carrier segment revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008, Carrier’s business backlog was $1,996 million as compared to $2,097 million at December 31, 2007. Substantially all the
business backlog at December 31, 2008 is expected to be realized as sales in 2009.

UTC Fire & Security

UTC Fire & Security is a global provider of security and fire safety products and services. We created the UTC Fire & Security segment
in the second quarter of 2005 upon acquiring Kidde and adding the Kidde industrial, retail and commercial fire safety businesses to the former Chubb segment. In the electronic security industry, UTC Fire & Security provides system

UTC Fire & Security provides its products and services under Chubb, Kidde and other brand names and sells directly to the customer as well as
through manufacturer representatives, distributors, dealers and U.S. retail distribution. Revenues generated by UTC Fire & Security’s international operations were 83 percent and 82 percent of total UTC Fire & Security segment
revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008, UTC Fire & Security’s business backlog was $1,064 million as compared to $1,084 million at December 31, 2007. Substantially all the business backlog at
December 31, 2008 is expected to be realized as sales in 2009.

Pratt & Whitney

Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for the
commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. Pratt & Whitney’s Global Services provides maintenance, repair and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts, as well as fleet management services for large
commercial engines. Pratt & Whitney produces families of engines for wide and narrow body aircraft in the commercial and military markets. Pratt & Whitney also sells engines for industrial applications and space propulsion systems.
Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) is a world leader in the production of engines powering business, regional, light jet, utility and military aircraft and helicopters. Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) is a leader in the design,
development and manufacture of sophisticated aerospace propulsion systems for military and commercial applications, including the U.S. space shuttle. Pratt & Whitney’s Global Material Solutions (GMS) is in the process of engineering,
certifying, manufacturing and selling new parts, including life limited parts, for CFM56

®

-3 engines.

In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney
has entered into collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs and risks are shared. At December 31, 2008, the interests of participants in new and existing Pratt & Whitney-directed commercial jet engine production programs
ranged from 14 percent to 29 percent. In addition, Pratt & Whitney has interests in other engine programs, including a 33 percent interest in the International Aero Engines (IAE) collaboration that sells and supports V2500

®

engines for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. At December 31, 2008, a portion of Pratt & Whitney’s interests in IAE (equivalent to 4 percent of the overall IAE
collaboration) were held by Pratt & Whitney sub-partners. Pratt & Whitney also has a 50 percent interest in the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, undertaken to develop, market and manufacture the GP7000

®

engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. This engine entered into service with its first revenue service flight in August 2008. At December 31, 2008, 40 percent of Pratt &
Whitney’s 50 percent interest in the EA was held by other participants. Pratt & Whitney is also pursuing additional collaboration partners.

In terms of engine development programs, Pratt & Whitney is under contract with the U.S. Air Force to develop the F135 engine, a derivative of Pratt & Whitney’s F119 engine, to power the
single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft being developed by Lockheed Martin. In addition, Pratt & Whitney is currently developing technology intended to enable it to power proposed and future aircraft, including testing of the PurePower
PW1000G geared turbofan engine. The technology demonstrator of the PurePower PW1000G engine completed flight testing in 2008. Pratt & Whitney has also received Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) certification for the Advantage 70 upgrade to
its PW4000 engine for Airbus A330 aircraft. The Advantage 70 upgrade is intended to reduce maintenance and fuel costs and increase thrust. Certifications for the Advantage 70 from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are anticipated in 2009.
PWR is developing a liquid fuel J-2X engine to support NASA’s vision for space exploration. PWR is also upgrading the performance of the RS68 engine to support U.S. Air Force launch requirements and NASA requirements. P&WC is developing the
PW600 engine series for the



very light jet market. In 2008, P&WC received FAA and EASA certification for the PW600. PW600 engine models have been selected by engine manufacturers
such as Cessna Aircraft and Embraer. P&WC is also developing the PW210 engine for Sikorsky’s S-76D helicopter and the PurePower PW800 for the new generation of long-range business jets. In 2008, IAE received EASA and FAA aircraft
certification for its SelectOne

TM

upgrade to the V2500 engine for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. The first of these upgraded engines entered
into revenue service in October 2008. The SelectOne upgrade is part of IAE’s V2500Select

SM

program of product and service enhancements launched
in November 2005. In 2008, GMS received supplemental type certifications from the FAA and EASA for all of the CFM56-3 engine life limited parts being developed by GMS. Pratt & Whitney continues to enhance its programs through performance
improvement measures and product base expansion.

Pratt & Whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers,
airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies, space launch vehicle providers and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s products and services must adhere to strict regulatory and market-driven safety
and performance standards. The frequently changing nature of these standards, along with the long duration of aircraft engine programs, create uncertainty regarding engine program profitability. The vast majority of sales are made directly to the
end customer and, to a limited extent, through independent distributors and foreign sales representatives. Sales to Airbus and Boeing were 11.7 and 6.5 percent, respectively, of total Pratt & Whitney revenues in 2008, before taking into
account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers. Sales to the U.S. government were 27.4 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment revenues in 2008.

Revenues from Pratt & Whitney’s international operations, including U.S. exports, were 60 percent and 56 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. At
December 31, 2008, Pratt & Whitney’s business backlog was $23,570 million, including $5,871 million of U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts, as compared to $23,607 million and $5,334 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2007. Of the total Pratt & Whitney backlog at December 31, 2008, approximately $8,975 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2009. Pratt & Whitney’s backlog includes certain contracts for which
actual costs may ultimately exceed total revenues from these contracts. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008 Annual Report for a description of our accounting for long-term contracts.

Hamilton Sundstrand

Hamilton Sundstrand is among the
world’s leading suppliers of technologically advanced aerospace and industrial products and aftermarket services for diversified industries worldwide. Hamilton Sundstrand’s aerospace products, such as power generation, management and
distribution systems, flight systems, engine control systems, environmental control systems, fire protection and detection systems, auxiliary power units and propeller systems, serve commercial, military, regional, business and general aviation, as
well as space and undersea applications. Aftermarket services include spare parts, overhaul and repair, engineering and technical support and fleet maintenance programs. Hamilton Sundstrand sells aerospace products to airframe manufacturers, the
U.S. and foreign governments, aircraft operators and independent distributors. Hamilton Sundstrand sales of aerospace products to Boeing, Airbus and Pratt & Whitney, collectively, including sales where the U.S. government was the ultimate
customer, were 17.3 percent of Hamilton Sundstrand segment sales in 2008.

Hamilton Sundstrand is engaged in development programs for the
Boeing 787 aircraft, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II military aircraft and the Airbus A400M military aircraft, and has developed and delivered systems for the Airbus A380 aircraft. Hamilton Sundstrand is also the prime contractor for
NASA’s space suit/life support system and produces environmental monitoring and control, life support, mechanical systems and thermal control systems for the U.S. space shuttle program, the international space station and the Orion crew
exploration vehicle.

Hamilton Sundstrand’s principal industrial products, such as air compressors, metering pumps and fluid handling
equipment, serve industries involved with raw material processing, bulk material handling, construction, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, and water and wastewater treatment. Hamilton Sundstrand sells these products under the Sullair, Sundyne,
Milton Roy and other brand names directly to end-users, and through manufacturer representatives and distributors.

Revenues generated by
Hamilton Sundstrand’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 51 percent and 50 percent of total Hamilton Sundstrand segment revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008, Hamilton Sundstrand’s
business backlog was $5,226 million, including $913 million under U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts, as compared to $5,152 million and $823 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Of the total Hamilton Sundstrand backlog at
December 31, 2008, approximately $2,543 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2009.

Sikorsky

Sikorsky is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of military and commercial helicopters and also provides aftermarket helicopter and aircraft
parts and services.



Current major production programs at Sikorsky include the UH-60M Black Hawk medium-transport helicopters
and HH-60M Medevac helicopters for the U.S. and foreign governments, the S-70 Black Hawk for foreign governments, the MH-60S and MH-60R helicopters for the U.S. Navy, the International Naval Hawk for multiple naval missions, and the S-76 and S-92
helicopters for commercial operations. The UH-60M helicopter is the latest and most modern in a series of Black Hawk variants that Sikorsky has been delivering to the U.S. Army since 1978 and requires significant additional assembly hours relative
to the previous variants. In December 2007, the U.S. government and Sikorsky signed a five-year multi-service contract for 537 H-60 helicopters to be delivered to the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, which include the UH-60M, HH-60M, MH-60S and MH-60R. The
contract includes options for an additional 263 aircraft, spares, and kits, potentially making it the largest contract in UTC and Sikorsky history. Actual production quantities will be determined year-by-year over the life of the program based on
funding allocations set by Congress and Pentagon acquisition priorities. The deliveries of the aircraft are scheduled to be made through 2012. Sikorsky is also developing the CH-53K next generation heavy lift helicopter for the U.S. Marine Corps and
the CH-148, a derivative of the H-92, a military variant of the S-92, for the Canadian government. The latter is being developed under a fixed-price contract that provides for the development, production, and 20-year logistical support of 28
helicopters. This is the largest and most expansive fixed-price development contract in Sikorsky’s history. In December 2008, Sikorsky and the Canadian government executed amendments to the contract that revised the delivery schedule and
contract specifications. The first test flight was successfully conducted in November 2008 and delivery of the first helicopter is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2010.

Sikorsky’s aftermarket business includes spare parts sales, overhaul and repair services, maintenance contracts and logistics support programs for
helicopters and other aircraft. Sales are made directly by Sikorsky and by its subsidiaries and joint ventures. Sikorsky is increasingly engaging in logistics support programs and partnering with its government and commercial customers to manage and
provide maintenance and repair services.

Revenues generated by Sikorsky’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were
36 percent and 34 percent of total Sikorsky revenues in 2008 and in 2007, respectively. At December 31, 2008, Sikorsky’s business backlog was $13,167 million, including $6,725 million under U.S. government-funded contracts and
subcontracts, as compared to $11,445 million and $5,180 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Of the total Sikorsky backlog at December 31, 2008, approximately $6,055 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2009.

Other

UTC Power has developed products and
services for commercial buildings using 200kW phosphoric acid fuel cell and microturbine-driven absorption chilling systems. These systems are highly efficient combined cooling, heating and power systems. In addition, UTC Power has developed a
geothermal power system capable of producing power from the lowest temperature geothermal water used to date to produce electricity. UTC Power is the world leader in the application of fuel cell technology to transportation applications, including
automobiles, transit buses and the U.S. space shuttle program. UTC Power is also a provider of energy advisory and consulting services aimed at making commercial buildings more energy efficient.

UTC Power is the world leader in stationary fuel cell power with more than 260 200kW phosphoric acid fuel cell power plants sold since 1992. UTC Power
has also developed a 400kW fuel cell which is scheduled to be placed into service in 2009. This new fuel cell is expected to have greater durability than any other large stationary fuel cell currently available in the market. UTC Power’s
automotive and bus transportation fuel cell power plants are based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology, including its PureMotion 120 power plant, which is currently used in revenue service in transit bus applications in Connecticut,
California and Europe.

UTC Power is currently developing PEM fuel cells for submarine applications. In addition, UTC Power is a maker of alkaline-based fuel cells used to provide electricity and drinking water to the U.S. space
shuttle.

Although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of total system efficiency
and environmental characteristics, the technology is still in either early commercialization or development. Continued technology advancement and cost reduction are required to achieve wide-scale market acceptance. Government support is needed to
fully commercialize fuel cell technology. There is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable fuel cells will be produced.

UTC Power merged with UTC Fuel Cells, effective January 1, 2007, with UTC Power continuing as the surviving entity. UTC is in the process of incorporating UTC Power’s combined cooling, heating and power
systems business within Carrier’s businesses, its geothermal power systems business within Pratt & Whitney’s power systems business, and its space and defense fuel cell power plant business within Hamilton Sundstrand’s
energy, space and defense business. These transitions are expected to be completed during the first half of 2009. The results of UTC Power and UTC Fuel Cells are included in the “Eliminations and Other” category in the segment financial
data in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008 Annual Report.



Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole

Competition and Other Factors Affecting Our Businesses

As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic and other factors, including those described in this section, in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” included in our 2008 Annual Report, in Item 1, “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,” and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Each business unit is subject to
significant competition from a large number of companies in the United States and other countries, and each competes on the basis of price, delivery schedule, product performance and service.

Our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers, foreign manufacturers (whose governments sometimes provide
research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their national commercial products) and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. In particular, Pratt & Whitney
experiences intense competition for new commercial airframe/engine combinations. Engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, participation in financing arrangements and
maintenance agreements. Customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from
suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Significant elements of our aerospace businesses, such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. Therefore, backlog
information may not be indicative of future demand. Pratt & Whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are GE Aviation, Rolls-Royce, Honeywell and Turbomeca. For information regarding customer financing commitments,
participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees, see Notes 4 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008 Annual Report.

Research and Development

Since changes in technology
can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position, we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development. These expenditures, which are charged to expense as incurred, were $1,771 million or 3.1 percent of
total sales in 2008, as compared with $1,678 million or 3.1 percent of total sales in 2007 and $1,529 million or 3.2 percent of total sales in 2006. We also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the U.S. government and
other customers. This contract research and development, which is performed principally in the Pratt & Whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the Hamilton Sundstrand and Sikorsky segments, amounted to $2,101 million in 2008, as compared
to $2,123 million in 2007 and $1,952 million in 2006. These contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred, through cost of products sold, and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently
recovered through production aircraft shipments. Of the totals, $2,008 million, $1,872 million and $1,621 million were expensed in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The remaining costs have been capitalized.

U.S. Government Contracts

U.S. government contracts
are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be
entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring
undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Most of our U.S. government sales are made under fixed-price type contracts, while approximately $2,721 million or 4.6 percent of our total sales for 2008 were made
under cost-reimbursement type contracts.

Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to audits. Like many defense contractors,
we have received audit reports from the U.S. government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to
government regulations. Some of these audit reports have involved substantial reductions. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases. For further
discussion of risks related to government contracting, see the discussion in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008
Annual Report for further discussion.

Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations

Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory
authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the



environment. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be
required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. Environmental matters are further addressed in “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008 Annual Report.

Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the
violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected.

We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. Changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide
operations. For example, governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards, elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of Carrier, Otis and UTC Fire & Security respectively, while
government safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses.

Intellectual Property and Raw Materials

We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses and
franchises related to our businesses. While this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business, we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on
our overall business or on any of our operating segments.

We believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials, components,
services and supplies used in our manufacturing. We work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating our purchases,
reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to
allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Like other users in the United States, we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt (Finland, Norway, Russia and Canada), tantalum (Australia and
Canada), chromium (South Africa, Kazakhstan, Zimbabwe and Russia) and rhenium (Chile, Kazakhstan and Germany). We have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the
conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. We believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Although
recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses (steel, copper, aluminum, titanium and nickel) have caused margin and cost pressures, we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies
that would have an adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our business segments. For further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in
this Form 10-K.

Employees and Employee Relations

At December 31, 2008, our total employment was approximately 223,100, approximately 65 percent of which represents employees based outside the United States. During 2008, we renegotiated thirteen multi-year
collective bargaining agreements, the largest of which covered certain workers at Carrier, Hamilton Sundstrand, and Sikorsky. In 2009, numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation, the largest of which cover certain workers
at Sikorsky and Carrier. We do not anticipate any problems in renegotiating these contracts that would either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. For discussion of the
effects of our restructuring actions on employment, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008 Annual Report.

For a discussion of other matters which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including the risks of
our international operations, see the further discussion under the headings “General” and “Description of Business by Segment” in this section, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K, and under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2008 Annual Report.

Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Form 10-K contains statements which, to the extent they are
not statements of historical or present fact, constitute “forward-looking statements” under the securities laws. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements may also be included in other materials released to the public.
These forward-looking statements are intended to provide management’s current expectations or plans for our future operating and financial performance, based on assumptions



currently believed to be valid. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believe,” “expect,”
“plans,” “strategy,” “prospects,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “guidance” and other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future
operating or financial performance. These include, among others, statements relating to:

•

future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial performance;

•

the effect of economic conditions in the United States and globally, including the financial condition of our customers and suppliers;

•

new business opportunities;

•

restructuring costs and savings;

•

the scope, nature or impact of acquisition activity and integration into our businesses;

•

the development, production and support of advanced technologies and new products and services;

•

the anticipated benefits of diversification and balance of operations across product lines, regions and industries;

•

the impact of the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements;

•

the outcome of contingencies;

•

future repurchases of common stock;

•

future levels of indebtedness and capital spending; and

•

pension plan assumptions and future contributions.

All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K for
2008 includes important information as to these factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements in the “Business” section under the headings “General,”
“Description of Business by Segment” and “Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole,” and in the “Risk Factors” and “Legal Proceedings” sections. Additional important information as to these factors is
included in our 2008 Annual Report in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings “Business Overview,” “Critical Accounting
Estimates,” “Environmental Matters” and “Restructuring and Other Costs.” For additional information identifying factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements,
see our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Our business, financial condition,
operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future
results. For a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see the discussion in the “Business” section under the headings “Other
Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole” and “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” in this Form 10-K and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in our 2008 Annual Report.

Our Global Growth is Subject to a Number of
Economic Risks

As widely reported, financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have been experiencing extreme
disruption in recent months, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. Governments have
taken unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions that include severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance
our operations, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies. These economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. The current tightening
of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact
the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Our global
business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, financial strength of airline customers and government procurement.
Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. Dollar against certain major currencies such as the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity
of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries.



Our Financial Performance Is Dependent on the Conditions of the Construction and Aerospace Industries

The results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 62 percent of our revenues in 2008, are
influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy
costs, the tightening of the U.S. credit markets and other global and political factors. In addition to these factors, Carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, in its
residential business, weather conditions.

The results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately
38 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. The challenging operating environment currently faced by commercial
airlines is expected to continue. As a result, capital spending by commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing,
labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, and
backlog levels, all of which could reduce both the demand for air travel and the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel
and our aerospace businesses aftermarket sales and margins. Also, since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2009, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that
firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. At times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the
development stage of the program. In addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. The defense industry is also affected by a changing global political
environment, continued pressure on U.S. and global defense spending and U.S. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. Spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage,
pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict
the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. A reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have an adverse
effect on our financial performance or results of operations.

Our Business May Be Affected by Government Contracting Risks

U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our
failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other
damages it suffers. We are now, and believe that in light of the current U.S. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more U.S. government investigations. If we or one of our business units were charged with
wrongdoing as a result of any U.S. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws), the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. government contracts pending the
completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages. The U.S. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. The U.S.
government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years. Independently, failure to comply with
U.S. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the United States could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges. In addition, we are also sensitive to U.S. military
budgets, which may fluctuate to reflect the policies of a new administration or Congress.

Our International Operations Subject Us to Economic Risk
As Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Economic Conditions, Foreign Currency Fluctuations and Changes in Local Government Regulation

We conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 64 percent of our total 2008 segment revenues derived from operations outside of the United States and from U.S. export sales. Changes in local and
regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-U.S. operations (primarily the commercial businesses) where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies.
In addition, currency



fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. As a result, our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by
worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for cross border transactions. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when
financial statements of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. dollars. Given that the majority of our revenues are non-U.S. based, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our
results of operations.

The majority of sales in the aerospace businesses is transacted in U.S. dollars, consistent with established
industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the United States is incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the Euro and the Canadian dollar). For operating units with U.S. dollar sales and local currency costs,
there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. To manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging
strategies associated with U.S. dollar revenues. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008 Annual Report for a discussion of our hedging strategies.

Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation,
exchange controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic
instability. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. For example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require
us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. The contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. In
addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa that carry high levels of currency, political and economic risk.

While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or operating results.

We Use a Variety of Raw Materials, Supplier-Provided Parts, Components, Sub-Systems and Third Party Contract
Manufacturing Services in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages, Supplier Capacity Constraints, Supplier Production Disruptions or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products

Our reliance on suppliers, third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and
sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be
subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions, price
increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management and production practices
are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have
an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

We Engage in Acquisitions, and May Encounter Difficulties Integrating
Acquired Businesses with Our Current Operations; Therefore, We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Acquisitions

We seek
to grow through strategic acquisitions. In the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and may continue to do so in the future. The success
of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions, apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, and cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter
difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, or in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when
we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, the recent effectiveness of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business
Combinations,” which, among other things, requires companies to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses.



We Design, Manufacture and Service Products that Incorporate Advanced Technologies; The Introduction of New
Products and Technologies Involves Risks and We May Not Realize the Degree or Timing of Benefits Initially Anticipated

We seek to
achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. We regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a
wide range of technologies, products and services. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules;
execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of internal and supplier-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; achieving cost and production efficiencies, validation of innovative technologies
and the level of customer interest in new technologies and products. These factors involve significant risks and uncertainties. We may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services, and may not realize the degree
or timing of benefits initially anticipated. In particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities Pratt & Whitney or its affiliates will produce aircraft engines currently in development or pending required
certifications. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We Are Subject to Litigation and Legal
Compliance Risks That Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance
risks. These risks include, among other things, litigation concerning product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with U.S. and foreign export laws,
competition laws and sales and trading practices. We or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such litigation. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in
certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. Independently, failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and
suspension or termination of export privileges. While we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will
continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. For non-income tax
risks, we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts
and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial
statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. For a description of current legal proceedings, see
Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K. For income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the
applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. For those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50% likelihood that such tax benefit will be sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in
our financial statements. Subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which such event
occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs.

Our fixed assets as of December 31, 2008 include manufacturing facilities and non-manufacturing facilities such as warehouses set forth in the tables above and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment,
most of which are general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs, tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The facilities, warehouses, machinery and equipment in use as of
December 31, 2008 are in good operating condition, are well-maintained and substantially all are in regular use.



Our management believes that the fixed assets capitalized and the facilities in operation at
December 31, 2008 for the production of our products are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein in the current business environment and have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes. Utilization of
the facilities varies based on demand for the products. We continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time adjust our facility needs.

For discussion of the effect of our restructuring actions on manufacturing facilities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2008 Annual Report.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

As previously disclosed, the
Department of Justice (DOJ) sued us in 1999 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, claiming that Pratt & Whitney violated the civil False Claims Act and common law. This lawsuit relates to the “Fighter Engine
Competition” between Pratt & Whitney’s F100 engine and General Electric’s F110 engine. The DOJ alleges that the government overpaid for F100 engines under contracts awarded by the U.S. Air Force in fiscal years 1985 through
1990 because Pratt & Whitney inflated its estimated costs for some purchased parts and withheld data that would have revealed the overstatements. At trial of this matter, completed in December 2004, the government claimed Pratt &
Whitney’s liability to be $624 million. On August 1, 2008, the trial court judge held that the Air Force had not suffered any actual damages because Pratt & Whitney had made significant price
concessions. However, the trial court judge found that Pratt & Whitney violated the False Claims Act due to inaccurate statements contained in the 1983 offer. In the absence of actual damages, the trial court judge awarded
the DOJ the maximum civil penalty of $7.09 million, or $10,000 for each of the 709 invoices Pratt & Whitney submitted in 1989 and later under the contracts. Both the DOJ and UTC have appealed the decision.
Should the government ultimately prevail, the outcome of this matter could result in a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid.

As previously disclosed, on February 21, 2007, the European Commission’s Competition Directorate (EU Commission) ruled that
Otis’ subsidiaries in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and a portion of the business of Otis’ German subsidiary, violated European Union (EU) competition rules and assessed a €225 million (approximately $300 million)
civil fine against Otis, its relevant local entities, and UTC, which was paid during 2007. In May 2007, we filed an appeal of the decision before the EU’s European Court of First Instance. Resolution of the matter is not expected within the
next twelve months.

As previously disclosed, during the first quarter of 2007, the Austrian Federal Competition Authority (Competition
Authority) filed a complaint with the Cartel Court in Austria (Cartel Court) against Otis’ Austrian subsidiary in connection with an investigation of unlawful collusive arrangements in the Austrian elevator and escalator industry. On
December 14, 2007, the Cartel Court, at the request of the Competition Authority, assessed civil fines against the participants in the collusive arrangements, including a fine of €18.2 million (approximately $26 million) against
Otis’ Austrian subsidiary, which fine was fully provided for as of December 31, 2007. Otis Austria appealed this ruling in January 2008. In October 2008, the Cartel Court denied the appeal and in December 2008, this fine was paid in full.

As previously disclosed, in 2005 the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) conducted an inspection at the offices of Otis Korea and its
Korean competitors with respect to collusive activities in the market for new equipment sales, and in May 2007 expanded its investigation to include pricing of subcontracts for elevator installation. In September 2008, the KFTC assessed a fine
against Otis Korea of South Korean Won 17.3 billion (approximately $15 million) with respect to the new equipment sales investigation, which we previously accrued. In November 2008, this fine was paid in full. In October 2008, the KFTC notified us
that the installation subcontractor pricing investigation had been closed without action.

In December 2008, the Department of Defense
(DOD) issued a contract claim against Sikorsky to recover overpayments the DOD alleges it has incurred since January 2003 in connection with cost accounting changes approved by the DOD and implemented by Sikorsky in 1999 and 2006. These changes
relate to the calculation of material overhead rates in government contracts. The DOD claimed that Sikorsky’s liability is approximately $80 million (including interest). We believe this claim is without merit and intend to appeal.

Like many other industrial companies in recent years, we or our subsidiaries are named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result
of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of our products or premises. While we have never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporate it in any currently-manufactured products, certain of our historical products, like those of many other
manufacturers, have contained components incorporating asbestos. A substantial majority of these asbestos-related claims have been covered by insurance or other forms of indemnity or have been dismissed without payment. The remainder of the closed
cases have been resolved for amounts that are not material individually or in the aggregate. Based on the information currently available, we do not believe that resolution of these asbestos-related matters will have a material adverse effect upon
our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.



Except as otherwise noted above, we do not believe that resolution of any of the legal matters discussed
above will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. A further discussion of government contracts and related investigations, as well as a discussion of our environmental
liabilities, can be found under the heading “Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole – Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations” in Item 1, “Business,” and in Item 1A, “Risk
Factors,” in this Form 10-K.

Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer (CFO) and the Vice President, Controller (Controller), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure
controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving
their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, our CFO and our Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our CEO, our CFO and our Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

Our management concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2008. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which appears in our 2008 Annual Report.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the
quarter ended December 31, 2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

UTC Common Stock available for delivery under the 2005 LTIP in an amount equal to 3.1 times the number of shares to which the award corresponds. Stock options and stock appreciation rights do not constitute Full Share Awards and will result in a
reduction in the number of shares of UTC Common Stock available for delivery under the 2005 LTIP on a one-for-one basis.

Consists of options awarded under the 1989 Long Term Incentive Plan (1989 LTIP), the 2005 LTIP and the Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan (Non-Employee Director Plan). Options issued under the 1989 LTIP include options that resulted from the conversion of awards granted under equity compensation plans of Sundstrand Corporation at the time it was merged into
Hamilton Sundstrand. This amount includes 281,000 restricted shares and restricted share units and 2,991,000 performance share units at the target level. Up to an additional 2,991,000 could be issued if performance goals are achieved above target.

Consists of options awarded under the UTC Employee Stock Option Plan. This Plan authorized the award of non-qualified
stock options to employees below the executive level considered to have the potential to contribute to the long-term success of UTC. These options consisted of rights to purchase a specified number of shares of UTC Common Stock at a fixed option
price equal to the fair market value of UTC Common Stock on the date the stock option was granted. Options vested three years after the grant date and have a ten-year term. Effective April 14, 2005, all equity compensation awards are now
provided under the shareowner-approved 2005 LTIP.

)

Weighted-average calculation does not include restricted shares and performance share units because they have no
exercise price.
