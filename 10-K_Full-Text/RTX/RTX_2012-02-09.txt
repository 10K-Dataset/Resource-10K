PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

United Technologies Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1934. UTC provides high technology products and services to the building systems
and aerospace industries worldwide. Growth is attributable primarily to the internal development of our existing businesses and to acquisitions. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2011 Annual Report, especially the information contained therein under the heading “Business Overview.”

Our operating units include businesses with operations throughout the world. Otis, Carrier and UTC Fire & Security (collectively referred
to as the commercial businesses) serve customers in the commercial, government infrastructure and residential property sectors worldwide. Carrier also serves commercial, industrial, transport refrigeration and food service equipment customers.
Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand and Sikorsky (collectively referred to as the aerospace businesses) primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment and aftermarket parts and services markets of the
aerospace industry. Hamilton Sundstrand, Pratt & Whitney and UTC Fire & Security also serve customers in certain industrial markets. For 2011, our commercial and industrial sales (generated principally by our commercial businesses)
were approximately 58 percent of our consolidated net sales, and commercial aerospace and military aerospace sales were approximately 22 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. Sales for 2011 from outside the United
States, including U.S. export sales, were 61 percent of our total segment sales.

On September 28, 2011, we announced a new
organizational structure to better serve customers and to drive growth and achieve efficiencies through greater integration across certain product lines. This new structure combines Carrier and UTC Fire & Security into a new segment called
UTC Climate, Controls & Security. Beginning with the first quarter of 2012, Carrier and UTC Fire & Security will report combined financial and operational results as part of this new segment. As part of this new organizational
structure, we also created UTC Propulsion & Aerospace Systems, a new organization consisting of Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand. We will continue to report the financial and operational results of Pratt & Whitney
and Hamilton Sundstrand separately, consistent with the manner in which we will allocate resources and measure financial performance for these segments. Further, we have reported our financial and operational results for the periods presented herein
under the six principal segments noted above, consistent with how we have reviewed our business operations for decision-making purposes, resource allocation and performance assessment.

This Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge
through the Investor Relations section of our Internet website (http://www.utc.com) under the heading “SEC Filings” as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). Our SEC filings are also available for reading and copying at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by
calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) containing reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

Description of Business by Segment

As noted above, our operations for the periods presented herein are classified into six principal segments: Otis, Carrier, UTC Fire & Security, Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand and Sikorsky.
Each segment groups similar operating companies and the management organization of each segment has general operating autonomy over a range of products and services. The principal products and services of each segment are as follows:



Otis—elevators, escalators, moving walkways and service.

Carrier—heating, ventilating, air conditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration systems, controls, services and energy-efficient products for residential, commercial,
industrial and transportation applications.

UTC Fire & Security—fire and special hazard detection and suppression systems, firefighting
equipment, security, monitoring and rapid response systems and service, and security personnel services.

Pratt & Whitney—commercial,
military, business jet and general aviation aircraft engines, parts and services, industrial gas turbines and space propulsion.

Hamilton
Sundstrand—aerospace products and aftermarket services, including power generation, management and distribution systems, flight control systems, engine control systems, environmental control systems, fire protection and detection systems,
auxiliary power units, propeller systems and industrial products, including air compressors, metering pumps and heavy duty process pumps.

Sikorsky—military and commercial helicopters, helicopter and aircraft aftermarket parts and services.

Segment financial data for the years 2009 through 2011, including financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales,
appears in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011 Annual Report. Segment sales as discussed below include intercompany sales, which are ultimately eliminated within the “Eliminations and other” category as reflected
in the segment financial data in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011 Annual Report. Similarly, total segment backlog as discussed below includes fully-funded government and intercompany backlog.

Otis

Otis is the world’s largest
elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Otis designs, manufactures, sells and installs a wide range of passenger and freight elevators for low-, medium- and high-speed applications, as well as a broad line of
escalators and moving walkways. In addition to new equipment, Otis provides modernization products to upgrade elevators and escalators as well as maintenance and repair services for both its products and those of other manufacturers. Otis serves
customers in the commercial and residential property industries around the world. Otis sells directly to the end customer and through sales representatives and distributors.

Sales generated by Otis’ international operations were 83 percent and 82 percent of total Otis segment sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2011, Otis’ backlog was $14.3 billion as
compared to $13.9 billion at December 31, 2010. Of the total Otis backlog at December 31, 2011, approximately $8.0 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2012.

Carrier

Carrier is the leading provider of HVAC and refrigeration solutions, including
controls for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation applications. In 2011, Carrier continued to execute the business transformation strategy it began in 2008 by completing divestitures of several non-core businesses and taking
noncontrolling equity interests in various ventures. This included taking a noncontrolling equity interest in a new South American venture in exchange for the contribution of Carrier’s existing HVAC operations in Brazil, Argentina and Chile to
the new venture, which manufactures and distributes HVAC products in those countries. Carrier’s products and services are sold under Carrier and other brand names to building contractors and owners, homeowners, transportation companies, retail
stores and food service companies. Through its venture with Watsco, Inc., Carrier distributes Carrier, Bryant, Payne and Totaline residential and light commercial HVAC products in the U.S. and selected territories in the Caribbean and Latin America.
Carrier sells directly to end customers and through manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, wholesalers, dealers and retail outlets. Certain of Carrier’s HVAC businesses are seasonal and can be impacted by weather. Carrier
customarily offers its customers incentives to purchase products to ensure an adequate supply of its products in the distribution channels. The principal incentive program provides reimbursements to distributors for offering promotional pricing on
Carrier products. We account for incentive payments made as a reduction to sales.

Sales generated by Carrier’s international
operations, including U.S. export sales, were 58 percent and 56 percent of total Carrier segment sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. At both December 31, 2011 and 2010, Carrier’s backlog was $2.2 billion. Substantially all of the backlog
at December 31, 2011 is expected to be realized as sales in 2012.

As described above, to better serve customers and to drive
growth and achieve greater efficiencies through greater integration across certain product lines, we announced a new organizational structure in September 2011, which combines Carrier with UTC Fire & Security into a new segment called UTC
Climate, Controls & Security. We will report combined financial and operational results for this new segment beginning with the first quarter of 2012.



UTC Fire & Security

UTC Fire & Security is a global provider of security and fire safety products and services. UTC Fire & Security provides electronic security products such as intruder alarms, access control
systems and video surveillance systems and designs and manufactures a wide range of fire safety products including specialty hazard detection and fixed suppression products, portable fire extinguishers, fire detection and life safety systems, and
other firefighting equipment. Services provided to the electronic security and fire safety industries include systems integration, video surveillance, installation, maintenance and inspection services. UTC Fire & Security also provides
monitoring, response and security personnel services, including cash-in-transit security, to complement its electronic security and fire safety businesses. In 2010, we completed the acquisition of the GE Security business from General Electric
Company. With the acquisition of GE Security, UTC strengthened its portfolio of security and fire safety technologies for commercial and residential applications, including fire detection and life safety systems, intrusion alarms, video surveillance
and access control systems, while also significantly enhancing UTC Fire & Security’s North American presence. In 2011, we continued to exit non-core businesses with the divestiture of our United Kingdom and Singapore guarding
businesses. UTC Fire & Security products and services are used by governments, financial institutions, architects, building owners and developers, security and fire consultants, homeowners and other end-users requiring a high level of
security and fire protection for their businesses and residences. UTC Fire & Security provides its products and services under Chubb, Kidde and other brand names and sells directly to the customer as well as through manufacturer
representatives, distributors, dealers and U.S. retail distribution.

Sales generated by UTC Fire & Security’s
international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 77 percent and 78 percent of total UTC Fire & Security segment sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2011, UTC Fire & Security’s backlog was $1.3
billion as compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2010. Substantially all of the backlog at December 31, 2011 is expected to be realized as sales in 2012.

As described above, in September 2011, to better serve customers and to drive growth and achieve greater efficiencies through greater integration across certain product lines, we announced a new organizational
structure which combines UTC Fire & Security with Carrier into a new segment called UTC Climate, Controls & Security. We will report combined financial and operational results for this new segment beginning with the first quarter
of 2012.

Pratt & Whitney

Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for the commercial, military, business jet and general
aviation markets. Pratt & Whitney Global Services provides maintenance, repair and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts, as well as fleet management services for large commercial engines. Pratt & Whitney produces
families of engines for wide- and narrow-body aircraft in the commercial market and for fighter and transport aircraft in the military market. Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) is a world leader in the production of engines powering
business, regional, light jet, utility and military airplanes and helicopters and provides related maintenance, repair and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts, as well as fleet management services. Pratt & Whitney
Rocketdyne (PWR) is a leader in the design, development and manufacture of sophisticated space propulsion systems for military and commercial applications. Pratt & Whitney Power Systems sells aero-derivative engines for industrial
applications.

In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into
collaboration arrangements in which sales, costs and risks are shared. At December 31, 2011, the interests of third party participants in Pratt & Whitney-directed commercial jet engine programs ranged from 14 percent to 48 percent. In
addition, Pratt & Whitney has interests in other engine programs, including the IAE International Aero Engines AG (IAE) collaboration, which sells and supports V2500 engines for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. On October 12, 2011,
Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce plc (Rolls-Royce), a participant in the IAE collaboration, announced an agreement to restructure their interests in IAE. Under the terms of the agreement, Rolls-Royce will sell its interests in IAE and
license its V2500 intellectual property in IAE to Pratt & Whitney for $1.5 billion plus an agreed payment contingent on each hour flown by V2500-powered aircraft in service at the closing date during the fifteen year period following
closing of the transaction. Consummation of this restructuring is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Also, on October 12, 2011, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce announced an agreement to form a new joint
venture, in which each will hold an equal share, to develop new engines to power the next generation of 120 to 230 passenger mid-size aircraft that will replace the existing fleet of mid-size aircraft currently in service or in development. With
this new joint venture, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce will focus on high-bypass ratio geared turbofan technology, as well as collaborate on future studies of next generation propulsion systems. Pursuant to the agreement, the formation of
this new venture is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, including completion of the restructuring of the parties’ interests in IAE. We expect the restructuring of the parties’ interests in IAE to be completed in
mid-2012. The closing of the new joint venture may take a substantially longer period of time to complete. Pratt & Whitney also has a 50 percent ownership interest in the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, which markets
and manufactures the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. Pratt & Whitney has entered into risk and revenue sharing arrangements with third parties for 40 percent of the content that Pratt & Whitney is responsible for
providing to the EA. Pratt & Whitney accounts for its interests in the EA joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Pratt & Whitney continues to pursue additional collaboration partners.



The development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth
opportunities. Pratt & Whitney is under contract with the U.S. Air Force to develop the F135 engine, a derivative of Pratt & Whitney’s F119 engine, to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft being developed by
Lockheed Martin. Pratt & Whitney achieved initial service release for the conventional take-off and landing/carrier variant and short take-off and vertical landing variant of the F135 engine in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively.
These propulsion system configurations are now certified for production and cleared for flight on the Lockheed Martin F-35B stealth fighter jet. In addition, Pratt & Whitney is currently developing technology, including the PurePower
PW1000G Geared TurboFan engine, intended to enable it to power both currently-proposed and future aircraft. The PurePower PW1000G engine targets a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels with lower environmental emissions and operating
costs than current production engines. In 2009, Pratt & Whitney successfully completed ground and flight testing of a demonstrator engine for the PurePower PW1000G engine. In December 2010, Airbus announced that it will offer a version of
the PurePower PW1000G engine as a new engine option to power its A320neo family of aircraft scheduled to enter into service in 2015. In September 2011, Pratt & Whitney announced a new collaboration with Japan Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC)
and MTU Aero Engines AG (MTU) to provide the PurePower PW1100G-JM engine for the Airbus A320neo program. Under the collaboration agreement, MTU will hold an 18 percent share and be responsible for the engine’s low pressure turbine and
participate jointly with Pratt & Whitney to provide the high pressure compressor for the engine. JAEC will hold a 23 percent share and be responsible for the engine fan, low pressure compressor and combustor/diffuser. Pratt &
Whitney will be responsible for the remainder of the PurePower PW1100G-JM engine and systems integration. Additionally, PurePower PW1000G engine models have been selected by Bombardier to power the new CSeries passenger aircraft and by Mitsubishi
Aircraft Corporation to power the new Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), scheduled to enter into service in 2013 and 2014, respectively. In 2011, the initial production version of the Bombardier CSeries PurePower PW1000G engine successfully completed
115 hours of flight testing and the initial production version of the MRJ PurePower PW1000G engine successfully completed over 300 hours of ground testing. Irkut Corporation of Russia has also selected the PurePower PW1000G engine to power the
proposed new Irkut MC-21 passenger aircraft, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2016. The success of these aircraft and the PurePower PW1000G family of engines is dependent upon many factors including technological challenges, aircraft
demand, and regulatory approval. Based on these factors, as well as the level of success of aircraft program launches by aircraft manufacturers and other conditions, additional investment in the PurePower program may be required. Pratt &
Whitney has also received Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification for the Advantage70 upgrade to its PW4000 engine for Airbus A330 aircraft. The Advantage70 upgrade is intended to reduce maintenance
and fuel costs and increase thrust. PWR is developing a liquid fuel J-2X engine to support NASA’s Space Launch System. PWR is also upgrading the performance of the RS-68 and RL10 engines to support U.S. Air Force launch requirements. P&WC
is developing the PW210 engine for Sikorsky’s S-76D helicopter and the PurePower PW800 engine for the new generation of long-range and heavy business jets. Pratt & Whitney continues to enhance its programs through performance
improvement measures and product base expansion.

Pratt & Whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft
manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies, space launch vehicle providers and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s products and services must adhere to strict regulatory and
market-driven safety and performance standards. The frequently changing nature of these standards, along with the long duration of aircraft engine development, production and support programs, creates uncertainty regarding engine program
profitability. The vast majority of sales are made directly to the end customer and, to a limited extent, through independent distributors and foreign sales representatives. Sales to Airbus were 16 percent and 12 percent of total Pratt &
Whitney segment sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively, before taking into account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers. Sales to the U.S. government were 28 percent and 32 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in
2011 and 2010, respectively.

Sales generated by Pratt & Whitney’s international operations, including U.S. export sales,
were 54 percent and 52 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2011, Pratt & Whitney’s backlog was $22.4 billion, including $5.3 billion of U.S. government-funded
contracts and subcontracts. At December 31, 2010, these amounts were $23.5 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. Of the total Pratt & Whitney backlog at December 31, 2011, approximately $4.6 billion is expected to be realized as
sales in 2012. Pratt & Whitney’s backlog includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total sales. Pratt & Whitney’s backlog excludes orders for new commercial engines that have not yet achieved
full aviation authority certification. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011 Annual Report for a description of our accounting for long-term contracts.

As described above, to better serve customers and to drive growth and achieve efficiencies through greater integration across certain product
lines, we announced a new organizational structure in September 2011. As part of this new structure, we created UTC Propulsion & Aerospace Systems, a new organization consisting of Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand. We will
continue to report the financial and operational results of Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand separately.

Hamilton Sundstrand

Hamilton Sundstrand is among the world’s leading suppliers of technologically advanced aerospace and industrial products and
aftermarket services for diversified industries worldwide. Hamilton Sundstrand’s aerospace products, such as power generation, management and distribution systems, flight control systems, engine control systems, environmental control systems,
fire protection



and detection systems, auxiliary power units and propeller systems, serve commercial, military, regional, business and general aviation, as well as military ground vehicle, space and undersea
applications. Aftermarket services include spare parts, overhaul and repair, engineering and technical support and fleet maintenance programs. Hamilton Sundstrand sells aerospace products to airframe manufacturers, the U.S. and foreign governments,
aircraft operators and independent distributors. Sales to Boeing were 11 percent and 9 percent of total Hamilton Sundstrand segment sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Sales to the U.S. government were 20 percent and 24 percent of total Hamilton
Sundstrand segment sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Hamilton Sundstrand is engaged in development programs for the Boeing 787
aircraft, the Bombardier CSeries aircraft, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, the Airbus A350 aircraft, the Irkut MC-21 aircraft, the COMAC C919 aircraft, the CH-53K next generation heavy lift helicopter for the U.S. Marine Corps and the Lockheed Martin
F-35 Lightning II military aircraft and the Airbus A400M military aircraft. Hamilton Sundstrand is also the operations support prime contractor for NASA’s space suit/life support system and produces environmental monitoring and control, life
support, mechanical systems, power generation, management, and distribution and thermal control systems for the International Space Station and the Orion crew exploration vehicle.

Hamilton Sundstrand’s principal industrial products, such as air compressors, metering pumps and heavy duty process pumps, serve industries
involved with chemical and hydrocarbon processing, oil and gas production, water and wastewater treatment and construction. Hamilton Sundstrand sells these products under the Sullair, Sundyne, Milton Roy and other brand names directly to end users,
and through manufacturer representatives and distributors.

Sales generated by Hamilton Sundstrand’s international operations,
including U.S. export sales, were 49 percent of total Hamilton Sundstrand segment sales in both 2011 and 2010. At December 31, 2011, Hamilton Sundstrand’s backlog was $5.4 billion, including $901 million of U.S. government-funded contracts
and subcontracts. At December 31, 2010, these amounts were $5.1 billion and $719 million, respectively. Of the total Hamilton Sundstrand backlog at December 31, 2011, approximately $2.8 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2012.
See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011 Annual Report for a description of our accounting for long-term contracts.

As described above, to better serve customers and to drive growth and achieve efficiencies through greater integration across certain product lines, we announced a new organizational structure in September 2011. As
part of this new structure, we created UTC Propulsion & Aerospace Systems, a new organization consisting of Hamilton Sundstrand and Pratt & Whitney. We will continue to report the financial and operational results of Hamilton
Sundstrand and Pratt & Whitney separately.

On September 21, 2011 we announced an agreement to acquire Goodrich
Corporation (Goodrich), a global supplier of systems and services to the aerospace and defense industry with 2010 sales of $7 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Goodrich shareholders will receive $127.50 in cash for each share of Goodrich
common stock they own at the time of the closing of the transaction. This equates to a total current enterprise value of $18.4 billion, including $1.9 billion in net debt to be assumed. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions,
including regulatory approvals and Goodrich shareholder approval. We expect that this acquisition will close in mid-2012. Goodrich products include aircraft nacelles and interior systems, actuation and landing systems, and electronic systems. Once
the acquisition is complete, Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand will be combined to form a new segment named UTC Aerospace Systems. We expect that the increased scale, financial strength and complementary products of the new combined business will
strengthen our position in the aerospace and defense industry. Further, we expect that this acquisition will enhance our ability to support our customers with more integrated systems.

Sikorsky

Sikorsky is one of the world’s largest helicopter companies. Sikorsky
manufactures military and commercial helicopters and also provides aftermarket helicopter and aircraft parts and services.

Current
major production programs at Sikorsky include the UH-60M Black Hawk medium-transport helicopters and HH-60M Medevac helicopters for the U.S. and foreign governments, the S-70 Black Hawk for foreign governments, the MH-60S and MH-60R helicopters for
the U.S. Navy, the International Naval Hawk for multiple naval missions, and the S-76 and S-92 helicopters for commercial operations. The UH-60M helicopter is the latest and most modern in a series of Black Hawk variants that Sikorsky has been
delivering to the U.S. Army since 1978. In December 2007, the U.S. government and Sikorsky signed a five-year multi-service contract for H-60 helicopters to be delivered to the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, which include the UH-60M, HH-60M, MH-60S and
MH-60R. Upon completion of the contract in 2013, Sikorsky expects to have delivered approximately 690 aircraft. Sikorsky is in negotiations with the U.S. government for a new five-year multi-service contract for H-60 helicopters. Sikorsky is also
developing the CH-53K next generation heavy lift helicopter for the U.S. Marine Corps and the CH-148 derivative of the H-92 helicopter, a military variant of the S-92 helicopter, for the Canadian government. The latter is being developed under a
fixed-price contract that provides for the development and production of 28 helicopters, and related logistical support through March 2028. The current contract value is estimated to be $4.5 billion, and is subject to changes in underlying variables
such as future flight hours as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This is the largest and most expansive fixed-price development contract in Sikorsky’s history. As previously disclosed, in June 2010 Sikorsky and the
Canadian government signed contract amendments that revised the delivery schedule and



contract specifications, and established the requirements for the first six interim aircraft to enable initial operational test and evaluation activities. The amendments also included
modifications to the liquidated damages schedule, readjustment of payment schedules, resolution of open disputes and other program enhancements. Sikorsky recognized revenue in 2011 upon completing a significant milestone for work related to four
interim configuration helicopters. Delivery of the final configuration aircraft is scheduled to begin in 2012. These aircraft will require further software testing and upgrades before full mission capability can be achieved. Sikorsky is in
discussions with the Canadian government concerning the need for additional interim aircraft, schedules to complete remaining work, and the resolution of open disputes.

Sikorsky’s aftermarket business includes spare parts sales, overhaul and repair services, maintenance contracts and logistics support programs for helicopters and other aircraft. Sales are principally made to
the U.S. and foreign governments, and commercial helicopter operators. Sikorsky is increasingly engaging in logistics support programs and partnering with its government and commercial customers to manage and provide logistics, maintenance and
repair services.

Sales to the U.S. government were 68 percent of total Sikorsky segment sales in both 2011 and 2010. Sales generated by
Sikorsky’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 34 percent and 33 percent of total Sikorsky segment sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2011, Sikorsky’s backlog was $9.4 billion, including $4.1
billion of U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts. At December 31, 2010, these amounts were $9.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Of the total Sikorsky backlog at December 31, 2011, approximately $4.9 billion is expected
to be realized as sales in 2012.

Other

UTC Power is a world leader in the application of fuel cell technology for stationary and transportation applications. UTC Power delivered more than 280 of its 200kW phosphoric acid fuel cell power plants for
stationary installations since 1992 before ceasing production of this model. In 2009, UTC Power began delivery of its newly-designed 400kW phosphoric acid fuel cell. To date, UTC Power has delivered more than 50 of these 400kW units to customers
worldwide. This new fuel cell is expected to have greater durability than any other large stationary fuel cell currently available in the market. UTC Power’s automotive and bus transportation fuel cell power plants are based on proton exchange
membrane (PEM) technology. PureMotion 120 power plants are currently used in revenue service in transit bus applications in Connecticut, California and Europe. UTC Power is currently developing PEM fuel cells for submarine applications.

Although fuel cells are generally believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of total system efficiency and
environmental characteristics, the technology is still in either early commercialization or the development stage. Continued technology advancement and cost reduction are required to achieve wide-scale market acceptance. Government support is needed
to fully commercialize fuel cell technology. There is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable fuel cells will be produced.

In December 2010, we completed the acquisition of Clipper Windpower Plc (Clipper), a California-based wind turbine manufacturer. This investment is intended to expand our power generation portfolio and allow us to
participate in the wind power business by leveraging our expertise in blade technology, turbines and gearbox design.

The results of UTC
Power and Clipper are included in the “Eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011 Annual Report.

Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole

Competition and Other Factors Affecting Our Businesses

As worldwide businesses, our operations
can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section, in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2011 Annual
Report, in Item 1, “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,” and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of
companies in the United States and other countries, and each competes on the basis of price, delivery schedule, product performance and service.

Our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers, foreign manufacturers (whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and
other assistance for certain of their commercial products) and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. In particular, Pratt & Whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframe/engine
combinations. Engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements. For information regarding customer
financing commitments, participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees of Pratt & Whitney, see Notes 4, 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011 Annual
Report. Customer selections of engines and components can also have a



significant impact on later sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original
equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Significant elements of our aerospace businesses, such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. Therefore, backlog information may not be indicative of
future demand. Pratt & Whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are GE Aviation, Rolls-Royce, Honeywell and Turbomeca.

Research and Development

Because changes in
technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position, we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development. These expenditures, which are charged to expense as incurred, were $2.1 billion or 3.5
percent of total sales in 2011, as compared with $1.7 billion or 3.2 percent of total sales in 2010 and $1.6 billion or 3.0 percent of total sales in 2009. We also perform research and development work under contracts funded by the U.S. government
and other customers. This contract research and development, which is performed in our aerospace businesses, amounted to $1.9 billion in 2011, as compared to $2.0 billion in 2010 and $2.1 billion in 2009. These contract research and development
costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred, through cost of products sold, and amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production shipments. Of the total contract research and development costs, $1.8
billion, $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion were expensed in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The remaining costs have been capitalized.

U.S.
Government Contracts

U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the
government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and
a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Most of
our U.S. government sales are made under fixed-price type contracts, while approximately $2.6 billion or 4.5 percent of our total sales for 2011 were made under cost-reimbursement type contracts.

Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to audits. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports from the U.S.
government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit
reports have recommended substantial reductions. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases. For further discussion of risks related to government
contracting, see the discussion in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011 Annual Report for further discussion.

Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations

Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have
incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection
of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. Environmental matters are further
addressed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011 Annual Report.

Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act
or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition
giving rise to the violation had been corrected.

In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to
concerns over climate change. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including compliance costs and increased energy and
raw materials costs.

We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. Changes in legislation or government
policies can affect our worldwide operations. For example, governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards, elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of Carrier, Otis and UTC
Fire & Security, respectively, while government safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses.



Intellectual Property and Raw Materials and Supplies

We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. While this portfolio is cumulatively important to
our business, we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.

We believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials, components, services and supplies used in our manufacturing. We
work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating our purchases, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global
sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Like other users
in the United States, we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt (Finland, Norway, Russia and Canada), tantalum (Australia and Canada), chromium (South Africa, Kazakhstan, Zimbabwe and Russia)
and rhenium (Chile, Kazakhstan and Germany). We have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing
processes. We believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses
(for example, steel, copper, aluminum, titanium and nickel) have caused margin and cost pressures, we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows,
competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. For further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.

Employees and Employee Relations

At December 31, 2011, our total number of employees was approximately 199,900, approximately 65 percent of which represents employees based
outside the United States. During 2011, we negotiated or concluded 31 domestic collective bargaining agreements, the largest of which covered certain workers at Carrier. In 2012, numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to
renegotiation, the largest of which cover certain workers at Carrier and Otis. Although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations, particularly at Sikorsky, we do not
anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. For discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment,
see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in this Form 10-K and under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011 Annual Report.

For a discussion of other matters which may affect our cash flows,
competitive position, financial condition or results of operations, including the risks of our international operations, see the further discussion under the headings “General” and “Description of Business by Segment” in this
section, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K, and under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2011 Annual Report.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our
actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.

Our Global Growth Is Subject to a Number of
Economic Risks

In 2011, the global economy improved as compared to 2010 and continued to show signs of a gradual recovery from
the significant downturn of 2008 and 2009 when the global economy experienced widespread recessionary conditions, record levels of unemployment, significant distress of financial institutions, extreme volatility in security prices, severely
diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. However, despite positive economic indicators seen in the beginning of 2011, uncertainty continues to exist as to the overall
rate and stability of the recovery. Global gross domestic product growth continues to be led by emerging markets, particularly in Brazil, Russia, India and China, while in the developed economies, particularly in Europe, the recovery remains
uncertain due to persistent high unemployment in the U.S. and Europe, a weak U.S. and European housing market, government budget reduction plans the unwinding of fiscal stimuli and concerns over the deepening European sovereign debt crisis. As a
result, further disruptions in Europe or in other economies could affect our sales or liquidity.



Although consumer confidence in the U.S. has improved since the economic downturn, it still remains
low, while, as mentioned above, unemployment remains high and the housing market remains depressed. There can be no assurance that any of the recent economic improvements will be broad-based and sustainable, or that they will enhance conditions in
markets relevant to us. Further, there can be no assurance that we will not experience further adverse effects that may be material to our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition, results of operations, or our ability to access
capital. While these economic developments have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations to date, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in
major economies. These economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. The tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases
and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, this tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and
increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer
spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. Dollar against certain major currencies such as the Euro,
the Canadian Dollar and other currencies also adversely affects our results, as the majority of our sales are non-U.S. based.

Our Financial
Performance Is Dependent on the Conditions of the Construction and Aerospace Industries

The results of our commercial and
industrial businesses, which generated approximately 58 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes,
interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, the tightening of global credit markets and other global and political factors. For example, a slowdown in building and remodeling
activity can adversely affect Carrier’s business. In addition to these factors, Carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business,
weather conditions.

The results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 42 percent of our
consolidated net sales in 2011, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. Although the operating environment currently faced by commercial airlines has shown signs
of gradual improvement in 2011, uncertainty continues to exist. As a result, financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, of one or more of the major commercial airlines could result in significant cancellations of orders, reductions in our
aerospace sales and losses under existing contracts. In addition, capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers
are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, worldwide airline profits, airline consolidation, competition, the retirement of older aircraft,
regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, and backlog levels, all of which could reduce the demand for air travel and the aftermarket sales and margins of our aerospace
businesses. Future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace businesses aftermarket sales and margins. Also, since a substantial portion of the
backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2012, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. At times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm
fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program. In addition, our aerospace businesses face intense
competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. The defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment, continued pressure on U.S. and global defense spending and U.S. foreign policy
and the level of activity in military flight operations. Spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft.
Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. A reduction in capital
spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial
condition.

Our Business May Be Affected by Government Contracting Risks

U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of
our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any
other damages it suffers. We are now, and believe that in light of the current U.S. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more U.S. government investigations relating to certain of our U.S. government
contracts. If we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any U.S. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws), the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or
receiving awards of new U.S. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages, and bar us from bidding
on or receiving new awards of U.S. government contracts. The U.S. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for
fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. Debarment



generally does not exceed three years. Independently, failure to comply with U.S. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the United States could result in
civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges. In addition, we are also sensitive to U.S. military budgets, which may fluctuate based on the policies of a new administration or Congress.

Our International Operations Subject Us to Economic Risk As Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Foreign Currency Fluctuations,
Economic Conditions and Changes in Local Government Regulation

We conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 61
percent of our total 2011 segment sales derived from international operations, including U.S. export sales. Changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits
in our non-U.S. operations (primarily the commercial businesses), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. As a
result, our operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations
in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. Dollars. Given that the majority of our sales are non-U.S. based, a strengthening of the
U.S. Dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations.

The majority of sales in the
aerospace businesses are transacted in U.S. Dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the United States are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the Euro, the Canadian
Dollar, and the Polish Zloty). For operating units with U.S. Dollar sales and local currency costs, there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the
U.S. Dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. To manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with U.S. Dollar sales. See Note 1 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2011
Annual Report for a discussion of our hedging strategies.

Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with
changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. Our international
sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to
differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. For example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and
financial support arrangements. The contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements.

In addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and countries in the Middle East, that carry high
levels of currency, political and economic risk. We expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our business evolves and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world
increase their demand for our products. Emerging market operations can present many risks, including civil disturbances, health concerns, cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product,
economic and government instability, and the imposition of exchange controls and capital controls. While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive
position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We Use a Variety of Raw Materials, Supplier-Provided Parts, Components,
Sub-Systems and Third Party Contract Manufacturing Services in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages, Supplier Capacity Constraints, Supplier Production Disruptions or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the
Competitive Positions of Our Products

Our reliance on suppliers, third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to
secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. In many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or
participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third party
contract manufacturer production disruptions, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to
customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier
capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.



We Engage in Acquisitions and Divestitures, and May Encounter Difficulties Integrating Acquired Businesses with,
or Disposing of Divested Businesses from, Our Current Operations; Therefore, We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of these Acquisitions and Divestitures

We seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. In the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement
and expand our businesses, and expect to do so in the future. For example, on September 21, 2011, we announced an agreement to acquire Goodrich and on October 12, 2011, Pratt & Whitney announced that Rolls-Royce will sell its
interests in IAE to Pratt & Whitney. Further, on October 12, 2011 Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce also announced an agreement to form a new joint venture to develop new engines to power the next generation of 120 to 230
passenger mid-size aircraft that will replace the existing fleet of mid-size aircraft currently in service or in development. Our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and
potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing
asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. We also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to
these acquisitions, or in managing strategic investments. Additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. In addition, the success of our pending acquisition of Goodrich and
Pratt & Whitney’s recently announced transactions with Rolls-Royce plc will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the proposed transactions, the timing of consummation of the proposed transactions,
and the ability of the parties to secure regulatory approvals, and in the case of the Goodrich transaction, the approval of Goodrich’s shareholders, in a timely manner. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of
operations. In addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during
periods in which we acquire new businesses. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. These divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial
arrangements, following the transaction. Under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations imposed on us and could affect our future financial results.

We May Not Complete the Goodrich Acquisition or Complete the Acquisition Within the Time Frame We Anticipate; The Acquired Business May Underperform Relative
to our Expectations; The Transaction May Cause Our Financial Results to Differ From Our Expectations or the Expectations of the Investment Community; We May Not Be Able to Achieve Anticipated Cost Savings or Other Anticipated Synergies.

The Goodrich acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions, as described above, and the completion of the transaction
is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The unpredictability of the business and regulatory conditions affecting the industries in which we and Goodrich operate, the uncertainty of regulatory approvals, the requirement that the merger
agreement be adopted by the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Goodrich common stock, and other risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our ability to complete the acquisition or complete the acquisition within the time
frame we anticipate.

In addition, if the acquisition is consummated, the success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our
ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from the integration of Goodrich with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The potential difficulties of
integrating the operations of Goodrich and realizing our expectations for the acquisition include, among others:

•

failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;

•

unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems;

•

unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;

•

unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators;

•

retaining key customers, suppliers and employees;

•

retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;

•

operating risks inherent in the Goodrich business and our business;

•

the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and

•

other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.



We Have Outstanding Debt and We Will Incur Significant Transaction- and Acquisition-Related Costs in Connection
With Financing the Acquisition of Goodrich; Our Debt Will Increase As A Result of the Acquisition and Any Incurrence of Indebtedness In Connection With the Acquisition, and Will Increase If We Incur Additional Debt in the Future and Do Not Retire
Existing Debt.

We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. As of
December 31, 2011, we had approximately $10.3 billion of total debt on a consolidated basis. We anticipate that Goodrich will have approximately $1.9 billion of net debt as of the closing of the acquisition of Goodrich, and we further
anticipate incurring significant additional debt in connection with the financing of the acquisition. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:

•

requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have
available for other purposes, such as acquisitions;

•

reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and

•

exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.

We may incur significantly more debt in the future. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase.

Our current global and domestic revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to
incur liens on our assets. Our current revolving credit facilities are available for general corporate purposes. There are currently no amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. Our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may
adversely affect our ability to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach
any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.

We Design, Manufacture and Service Products that Incorporate Advanced Technologies; The Introduction of New Products and Technologies Involves Risks and We
May Not Realize the Degree or Timing of Benefits Initially Anticipated

We seek to achieve growth through the design,
development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. The product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and
development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production,
certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier- and internally-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; hiring and training of
qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and
customer acceptance of our products and products that incorporate technologies we develop. These factors involve significant risks and uncertainties. Any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and
these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our
technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. We or our suppliers and subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially
anticipated. Due to the design complexity of our products, we may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other
projects. In particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, helicopters, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development
or pending required certifications. Our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return on our investment in these
contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. If we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a
contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. Some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and
schedule. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. The possibility exists that our competitors might develop new technology or
offerings that might cause our existing technology and offerings to become obsolete. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We Are Subject to Litigation, Tax, Environmental and Other Legal Compliance Risks

We are subject to a variety of litigation, tax and legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to
product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with U.S. and foreign export laws, competition laws and laws governing improper
business practices. We or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble
damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. Independently, failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or
termination of export privileges. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from
time to time, as may related



interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our
operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional
investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and
restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs.

In the area of taxes, changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as
changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to
examinations by various authorities, including tax authorities. In addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations
could be expanded. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our results may be affected by the outcome of legal
proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty.

For non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss
contingencies and establish reserves as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at
a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in a
material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. For a description of current legal proceedings, see Part I, Item 3
“Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K. For income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable
taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. For those income tax positions where we assess that there is not a greater than 50 percent likelihood that such tax benefits will be sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our
financial statements. Subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the
period in which any such event occurs or on our cash flows in the period in which the ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority occurs.

We May Be Unable to Realize Expected Benefits From Our Cost Reduction and Restructuring Efforts and Our Profitability May Be Hurt or Our Business Otherwise
Might Be Adversely Affected

In order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring
plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. These plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well
as other savings. We may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. These types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or
any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce
management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, adverse effects on employee morale and
the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive
position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Our Financial Performance May Be Adversely Affected By Information Technology
and Other Business Disruptions

Our business may be impacted by disruptions, including information technology attacks or
failures, threats to physical security, as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software,
attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. We have experienced
cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information
technology-related and other potential disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on
our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems
and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results
of operations.

We Depend On Our Intellectual Property, and Have Access to Certain Intellectual Property and Information of Our Customers and
Suppliers; Infringement or Failure to Protect Our Intellectual Property Could Adversely Affect Our Future Growth and Success

We
rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements,
information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. Our efforts to protect intellectual property and
proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents



issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude
our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. In addition, our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the United
States, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. We may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting
from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic
security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past and may experience them in the future,
potentially with more frequency.

Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages
associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Any of the foregoing could have a
material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Our fixed assets as of December 31, 2011 include manufacturing facilities and non-manufacturing
facilities such as warehouses set forth in the tables above and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which are general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs, tools and fixtures and in many instances having
automatic control features and special adaptations. The facilities, warehouses, machinery and equipment in use as of December 31, 2011 are in good operating condition, are well-maintained and substantially all are in regular use.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

As previously disclosed,
the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued us in 1999 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, claiming that Pratt & Whitney violated the civil False Claims Act and common law. This lawsuit relates to the “Fighter
Engine Competition” between Pratt & Whitney’s F100 engine and General Electric’s F110 engine. The DOJ alleges that the government overpaid for F100 engines under contracts awarded by the U.S. Air Force in fiscal years 1985
through 1990 because Pratt & Whitney inflated its estimated costs for some purchased parts and withheld data that would have revealed the overstatements. At trial of this matter, completed in December 2004, the government claimed
Pratt & Whitney’s liability to be $624 million. On August 1, 2008, the trial court judge held that the Air Force had not suffered any actual damages because Pratt & Whitney had made significant price concessions. However,
the trial court judge found that Pratt & Whitney violated the False Claims Act due to inaccurate statements contained in its 1983 offer. In the absence of actual damages, the trial court judge awarded the DOJ the maximum civil penalty of
$7.09 million, or $10,000 for each of the 709 invoices Pratt & Whitney submitted in 1989 and later under the contracts. In September 2008, both the DOJ and UTC appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In November 2010,
the Sixth Circuit affirmed Pratt & Whitney’s liability under the False Claims Act and remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for further proceedings on the question of damages. Should the government ultimately prevail, the
outcome of this matter could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid.

As previously disclosed, on February 21, 2007, the European Commission’s Competition Directorate (EU Commission) ruled that Otis’
subsidiaries in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and a portion of the business of Otis’ German subsidiary, violated European Union (EU) competition rules and assessed a

€

225 million (approximately $300 million) civil fine against Otis, its relevant local entities, and UTC, which was paid during 2007. In May 2007, we filed an appeal of the decision with the General Court
of the European Court of Justice (General Court). On July 13, 2011, the General Court rejected our appeal. On September 23, 2011, we filed an appeal of the judgment with the European Court of Justice.

As previously disclosed, in December 2008, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) issued a contract claim against Sikorsky to recover overpayments
the DOD alleges it has incurred since January 2003 in connection with cost accounting changes approved by the DOD and implemented by Sikorsky in 1999 and 2006. These changes relate to the calculation of material overhead rates in government
contracts. The DOD claims that Sikorsky’s liability is approximately $92 million (including interest through December 2011). We believe this claim is without merit, and Sikorsky filed an appeal in December 2009 with the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims, which is pending. We do not believe the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

A significant portion of our activities are subject to export control regulation by the U.S. Department of State (State Department) under the U.S.
Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). From time to time, we identify, investigate, remediate and voluntarily disclose to the State Department’s Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (DTCC) potential
violations of the ITAR. DTCC administers the State Department’s authority under the ITAR to impose civil penalties and other administrative sanctions for violations, including debarment from engaging in the export of defense articles or defense
services. Most of our voluntary disclosures are resolved without the imposition of penalties or other sanctions. However, in November 2011, DTCC informed us that it considers certain of our voluntary disclosures filed since 2005 to reflect
deficiencies warranting penalties and sanctions. We are currently in discussions with DTCC to reach a consent agreement, which we anticipate will provide for a payment by the Company and commitments regarding additional remedial compliance efforts.

The voluntary disclosures that we anticipate will be addressed in the consent agreement currently under discussion include 2006 and
2007 disclosures regarding the export by Hamilton Sundstrand to P&WC of certain modifications to dual-use electronic engine control software, and the re-export by P&WC of those software modifications and subsequent P&WC-developed patches
to China during the period 2002-2004 for use in the development of the Z-10 Chinese military helicopter. The DOJ has also separately conducted a criminal investigation of the matters addressed in these disclosures, as well as the accuracy and
adequacy of the disclosures. We have been cooperating with the DOJ’s investigation. Since November 2011, we have been in discussions with the DOJ to resolve this matter.

We continue to evaluate the range of possible outcomes of these separate but related export compliance matters, and have recognized a potential liability at December 31, 2011 of $45 million. We are currently
unable to predict the precise timing or outcome of the discussions. We do not believe the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations,
cash flows or financial condition.



Like many other industrial companies in recent years, we or our subsidiaries are named as a defendant
in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of our products or premises. While we have never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporate it in any currently-manufactured products, certain of
our historical products, like those of many other manufacturers, have contained components incorporating asbestos. A substantial majority of these asbestos-related claims have been covered by insurance or other forms of indemnity or have been
dismissed without payment. The remainder of the closed cases have been resolved for amounts that are not material individually or in the aggregate. Based on the information currently available, we do not believe that resolution of these
asbestos-related matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We are also subject to a number of routine lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that these matters
will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Except as
otherwise noted, we do not believe that resolution of any of the legal matters discussed above will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. A further discussion of
government contracts and related investigations, as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities, can be found under the heading “Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole – Compliance with Environmental and Other
Government Regulations” in Item 1, “Business,” and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Form 10-K.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

We did not make any repurchases of our common stock
under the current share repurchase program during the three months ended December 31, 2011, and there were no shares reacquired in transactions outside the program during the three months ended December 31, 2011. Under the current program,
which was announced on March 10, 2010 and which authorizes the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of our common stock, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions and under plans complying with Rules
10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In connection with our pending acquisition of Goodrich, on September 30, 2011 we announced that we will suspend additional share repurchases until at least
September 30, 2012, and will significantly reduce repurchases for two years thereafter. The number of remaining shares remaining for purchase under the current program is approximately 6,937,000. We may, however, continue to reacquire shares
outside of this program from time to time in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on the vesting of restricted stock.

Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule
13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Senior Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Vice President, Controller (Controller), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of
disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of
achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, CFO and Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our CEO, CFO and Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

,
released in 1992

.

Our management has concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in our 2011 Annual Report.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

The following table provides information as of December 31, 2011 concerning Common Stock issuable under UTC’s equity compensation plans.

(1)

Consists of: (i) shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options awarded under the 1989 Long-Term Incentive Plan (1989 LTIP), the 2005 Long-Term Incentive
Plan, as amended (2005 LTIP) and the Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (Non-Employee Director Plan); and (ii) shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding restricted share, restricted share unit and performance share unit
awards, assuming performance at the target level. This amount includes 811,000 restricted shares and restricted share units and 2,963,000 performance share units at the target level. Up to an additional 2,963,000 shares could be issued if
performance goals are achieved above target. The weighted average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights shown in column (b) takes into account only the shares identified in clause (i).

(2)

Represents as of December 31, 2011 the maximum number of shares of Common Stock remaining available for award. Stock awards will result in a reduction in the number of
shares of UTC Common Stock available for delivery under the 2005 LTIP in an amount equal to 4.03 times the number of shares to which the award corresponds. Stock options and stock appreciation rights do not constitute stock awards and will result in
a reduction in the number of shares of UTC Common Stock available for delivery under the 2005 LTIP on a one-for-one basis.

(3)

Consists of stock options awarded under the UTC Employee Stock Option Plan. This Plan authorized the award of non-qualified stock options to employees below the executive level
considered to have the potential to contribute to the long-term success of UTC. These options have a fixed option price equal to the fair market value of Common Stock on the date the stock option was granted. Options vest three years after the grant
date and have a ten-year term. Effective April 14, 2005, all equity incentive compensation awards are provided under the shareowner-approved 2005 LTIP.
