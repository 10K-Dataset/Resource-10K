UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION

Annual Report on Form 10-K For Year
Ended December 31, 2001

Whenever
reference is made in this Form 10-K to specific sections or pages of the
Corporation’s 2001 Annual Report to Shareowners, such sections or pages, as
applicable, are incorporated herein by reference. The “Corporation”, unless the
context requires otherwise, means United Technologies Corporation (or UTC) and its
subsidiaries.

Item 1. Business

United Technologies Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1934.  Growth is
attributable to acquisitions and the internal development of existing businesses of the
Corporation. The following description of the Corporation's business should be read in
conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Position appearing on pages 1 through 9 of the Corporation's 2001 Annual Report
to Shareowners, especially the information contained therein under the heading
“Business Environment."

The Corporation conducts its business through four principal segments.  The segments
were generally determined based on the management of the businesses and on the basis of
separate groups of operating companies, each with general operating autonomy over
diversified products and services.  The principal products of each segment are as
follows:

Segment financial data for the years 1999 through 2001,
including financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales, is
included in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 24 through 26
of the Corporation's 2001 Annual Report to Shareowners.

Description
of Business by Segment

Otis

Otis is the world's largest elevator and
escalator manufacturing, installation and service company.  Otis designs,
manufactures, sells and installs a wide range of passenger and freight elevators,
including hydraulic and traction elevators for low- and medium-speed applications and
gearless elevators for high-speed passenger operations in high-rise buildings.  Since
the February 2000 introduction of Otis’ new Gen2™ elevator system, installations
have continued in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region.  The first Gen2 installation in
North America is expected to occur by the second half of 2002.  Otis also produces a
broad line of escalators and, for horizontal transportation, moving walks and automated
people movers and shuttles.  In addition to new equipment, Otis provides
modernization products and services to upgrade elevators and escalators and maintenance
services for a substantial portion of the elevators and escalators which it sells, as well
as those of other manufacturers.  Otis' products and services are sold principally to
commercial building contractors and building owners.

Otis’ operations can be affected by
a variety of economic and other factors including those described in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position included in the
Corporation’s 2001 Annual Report to Shareowners and those described in the Business
section of this Form 10-K under the heading “Other Matters Relating to the
Corporation’s Business as a Whole”, as well as competition from a large number
of companies in the United States and other countries.  Otis competes on the basis of
price, delivery schedule, product performance and service.

Revenues generated by Otis'
international operations were 76 and 77 percent of total Otis segment revenues in 2001 and
2000, respectively.  At December 31, 2001, Otis’ business backlog was $3,777
million, as compared to $3,770 million at December 31, 2000.  Substantially all of
the business backlog at December 31, 2001 is expected to be realized as sales in 2002.

Carrier

Carrier is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial and residential HVAC systems and
equipment.  Carrier is also a leading producer of commercial and transport
refrigeration equipment, and provides aftermarket service and components for its products
and those of other manufacturers in both the HVAC and refrigeration industries.  The
products manufactured by Carrier include chillers and airside equipment, commercial
unitary systems, residential split systems (cooling only and heat pump), duct-free split
systems, window and portable room air conditioners and furnaces, as well as transport
refrigeration, commercial refrigeration and food service equipment.  Carrier's
products and services are sold under Carrier and other brand names to building contractors
and building owners, homeowners, shipping and trucking companies, supermarkets and food
service companies.  Sales are made both directly to the customer and through
manufacturers' representatives, distributors, dealers, individual wholesalers and retail
outlets.

Carrier has grown significantly in
recent years as a result of acquisitions.  Major acquisitions have included the
August 1999 acquisition of International Comfort Products Corporation, a North American
residential and light commercial HVAC equipment company; the February 2000 acquisition of
the Electrolux Group’s commercial refrigeration business in Europe; and the November
2000 acquisition of Specialty Equipment Companies, a manufacturer of commercial
refrigeration and food service equipment in the United States and Europe.  Carrier
participates in a joint venture with Toshiba Corporation in Japan.  Carrier and the
joint venture company, Toshiba Carrier Corporation, also participate in HVAC joint
ventures in the U.K. and Thailand.

Carrier’s operations can be
affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position
included in the Corporation’s 2001 Annual Report to Shareowners and those described
in the Business section of this Form 10-K under the heading “Other Matters Relating
to the Corporation’s Business as a Whole”, as well as competition from a large
number of companies in the United States and other countries and the level of activity in
industries using commercial refrigeration equipment.  Carrier competes on the basis
of price, delivery schedule, product performance and service.

Revenues generated by Carrier's
international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 47 and 48 percent of total
Carrier segment revenues in 2001 and 2000, respectively.  At December 31, 2001,
Carrier’s business backlog was $1,042 million, as compared to $1,004 million at
December 31, 2000.  Substantially all of the business backlog at December 31, 2001 is
expected to be realized as sales in 2002.

Pratt & Whitney

Pratt & Whitney is among the
world’s leading suppliers of commercial, general aviation and military aircraft
engines.  Pratt & Whitney provides overhaul and repair services, spare parts, and
fleet management services for the engines it produces, as well as for many other models of
commercial and military jet and gas turbine engines.  Pratt & Whitney also
produces industrial gas turbines for power generation, mechanical pump drive and marine
propulsion applications; liquid rocket propulsion systems and solid rocket motors.

Pratt & Whitney products are sold
principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft
leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments.  Pratt & Whitney sales in
the U.S. and Canada are also made directly to the customer and, to a limited extent,
through independent distributors.  Other export sales are made with the assistance of
independent sales representatives.  Sales to The Boeing Company (“Boeing”)
and Airbus Industrie (“Airbus”) were each 14 percent of total Pratt &
Whitney revenues in 2001, before taking into account discounts or financial incentives
offered to customers.

Pratt & Whitney currently produces
three families of large commercial jet engines.  Pratt & Whitney JT8D-200 series
engines power the Boeing MD-80 aircraft.  Applications for the PW2000 series include
the Boeing 757-200/PF aircraft and the Iluyshin IL-96 aircraft.  The PW4000 engine
family powers the Airbus A310-300, A300-600 and A330-200/300 series; the Boeing 747-400,
767-200/300 and 777-200/300 series of aircraft; and the Boeing MD-11 aircraft.  
(Boeing phased out production of new MD-80 and MD-11 aircraft.)  Pratt & Whitney
has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus to develop, market and sell
PW6000 series engines for installation on Airbus A318 aircraft.  The PW6000 was
certified by U.S. airworthiness authorities in January 2002.

- 2 -

In view of the risk and cost associated
with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into certain collaboration
arrangements in which costs, revenues and risks are shared.  At December 31, 2001,
the interests of other participants in these items were approximately as follows: 24
percent of the JT8D-200 series engine program, 29 percent of the PW2000 series engine
program, 14 percent of the 94 and 100 inch fan models of the PW4000, 26 percent of the
PW4084 and PW4090 models and 24 percent of the PW4098 model.  IAE International Aero
Engines AG, a collaboration in which Pratt & Whitney has a 33 percent interest,
markets and supports the V2500 engine.  Applications for the V2500 engine include
Airbus' A319, A320 and A321 aircraft and Boeing's MD-90.  (Boeing phased out
production of MD-90 aircraft in 2000.)  Pratt & Whitney also has a 50 percent
interest in GE-P&W Engine Alliance, LLC, an alliance formed in 1996 with GE Aircraft
Engines to develop, market and manufacture a new jet engine known as the GP7000.  The
new engine is intended to power the Airbus A380 aircraft.  In December 2000, Airbus
announced the launch of the A380 aircraft, with first deliveries scheduled for 2006.

Pratt & Whitney currently produces
three military aircraft engines: the F119 (powering the two-engine F-22 fighter aircraft),
the F100 (powering two-engine F-15 and single-engine F-16 fighter aircraft) and the F117
(powering four-engine C-17 transport aircraft).  With respect to the F119, Pratt
& Whitney is under contract with the U.S. Air Force (“USAF”) for both the
completion of flight testing and an initial engine production program.  The F119 is
the only anticipated source of propulsion for the F-22 fighter aircraft.  All of
Pratt & Whitney's F100 sales contracts are with the USAF or with foreign governments.
  All of Pratt & Whitney’s F117 sales contracts are with either the USAF or
Boeing.  Pratt & Whitney is also under contract with the USAF to develop the F135
engine, a derivative of Pratt & Whitney’s F119 engine, to power the single-engine
F35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.  In 2001, the U.S. Government proceeded into the
next phase of the development of the F35 by awarding an aircraft system development
contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation.  Management cannot predict with certainty
whether, when, and in what quantities Pratt & Whitney will produce F135 engines.

Pratt & Whitney Canada
(“PWC”) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of turbofan, turboprop
and turboshaft engines used in a variety of aircraft, including up to seventy passenger
business and regional/commuter airline aircraft, general aviation aircraft and light and
medium helicopters.  PWC also provides auxiliary power units for large commercial
aircraft, advanced gas turbine engines for industrial and power generation applications
and worldwide engine maintenance services.

Pratt & Whitney Space Propulsion
(“SP”) produces hydrogen fueled rocket engines for commercial and U.S.
Government space applications and advanced turbo pumps for NASA's Space Shuttle program.
  SP has a 50 percent interest in RD-Amross, LLC, a joint venture with NPO Energomash
that currently provides the Lox-Kerosene RD-180 booster engine for two Lockheed Martin
launch vehicles.  Chemical Systems, a unit of SP, manufactures solid fuel propulsion
systems and booster motors for commercial and civil applications and several U.S. military
launch vehicles and missiles.

Pratt & Whitney Power Systems
(“PWPS”) supplies industrial power generation and mechanical drive equipment in
the 300 kilowatts to 50 megawatts range.  PWPS also provides gas turbines for marine
propulsion applications.

Revenues from Pratt & Whitney's
international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 50 percent of total Pratt
& Whitney segment revenues in each of 2001 and 2000.  At December 31, 2001, Pratt
& Whitney’s business backlog was $11,161 million, including $1,949 million of
U.S. Government funded contracts and subcontracts, as compared to $9,866 million and
$1,434 million, respectively, at December 31, 2000.  Of the total Pratt & Whitney
backlog at December 31, 2001, approximately $4,272 million is expected to be realized as
sales in 2002.

Flight Systems

The Corporation's Flight Systems business is conducted through Sikorsky Aircraft and
Hamilton Sundstrand.  The Corporation acquired Sundstrand Corporation in 1999 and
combined it with the operations of the former Hamilton Standard.

Sikorsky is one of the world's largest manufacturers of military and commercial
helicopters and the primary supplier of transport helicopters to the U.S. Army and Navy.
  Sikorsky also supplies helicopters to foreign governments and the worldwide
commercial market.  Sikorsky produces helicopters for passenger, utility/transport,
cargo, anti-submarine warfare, and search and rescue operations.  Sikorsky's business
base also includes remanufacturing of used aircraft, spare parts sales, overhaul and
repair, and service contracts.

- 3 -

Current production programs at Sikorsky include the Black Hawk medium-transport helicopter
for the U.S. and foreign governments; the MH-60 Fleet Combat Support helicopter for the
U.S. Navy; the International Naval Hawk, a derivative of the U.S. Navy's Seahawk
medium-sized helicopter for multiple naval missions; and the S-76 intermediate-sized
helicopter for executive transport, offshore oil platform support, search and rescue,
emergency medical service and other utility operations.

Under a multi-year contract with the U.S. Government as amended through December 31, 2001,
Sikorsky has delivered 205 of 252 Black Hawk family helicopters as of December 31, 2001.
  In 2001, Sikorsky and the U.S. Government signed a three year $220 million
research, development and test contract to evaluate the potential for upgrading the U.S.
Army fleet of Black Hawks.  In addition, Sikorsky has contracts with foreign
government customers for the delivery of 21 helicopters from 2002 through 2004.

Sikorsky is engaged in development of the S-92 helicopter for the commercial market and an
H-92 variant for the military market.  A portion of the development is being carried
out by companies in Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Japan, Spain and Taiwan under
collaborative arrangements.  Regulatory certification of the S-92 is expected in
2002.  Marketing efforts for the S-92 and H-92 are in progress and several
non-binding deposit agreements have been received for S-92 helicopters.  Management
cannot predict with certainty whether, when, and in what quantities the S-92 and H-92 will
be produced.

Sikorsky has a 50 percent interest in a joint venture with Boeing for the development of
the RAH-66 Comanche light attack and reconnaissance helicopter.  The Sikorsky-Boeing
joint venture is performing under a cost reimbursement contract awarded in 1991.  The
first two prototype helicopters are undergoing flight testing, and the Sikorsky-Boeing
joint venture has entered into a $3.1 billion Engineering and Manufacturing Development
program with the U.S. Army to deliver thirteen Comanche helicopters in 2004 and 2005 for
test and evaluation purposes.  Under this EMD program, the first U.S. Army Comanche
unit is scheduled to be operationally equipped in 2006.  Management cannot predict
with certainty whether, when, and in what quantities any additional Comanche helicopters
will be produced.

Hamilton Sundstrand provides aerospace and industrial products and aftermarket services
for a diverse group of industries worldwide.  Hamilton Sundstrand's principal
aerospace products include aircraft power generation management and distribution systems;
environmental, flight, fuel and engine control systems; fuel and special fluid pumps;
auxiliary power units; propeller systems; electronic controls and components; and
specialized instruments and chemical detection and monitoring equipment.  Hamilton
Sundstrand is also the prime contractor for NASA's space suit/life support system and

Hamilton Sundstrand's aerospace businesses serve commercial, military, regional, business
and general aviation, as well as space and undersea applications.  Aftermarket
services include spare parts, overhaul and repair and engineering and technical support.
  Hamilton Sundstrand aerospace products are sold directly to airframe manufacturers,
the U.S. Government, aircraft operators and independent distributors.  Hamilton
Sundstrand sales of aerospace products to Boeing, Pratt & Whitney and Airbus,
collectively, including sales where the U.S. Government was the ultimate customer, were 14
percent of Flight Systems segment sales in 2001.  In 2001, Hamilton Sundstrand
acquired Claverham Group Ltd., a U.K.- based supplier of actuation systems for flight
control systems.

Hamilton Sundstrand's industrial products serve industries involved with raw material
processing, bulk material handling and construction (including mining; metal and other
material processing; hydrocarbon and chemical processing; and water and waste water
treatment).  These industrial products are sold directly to end-users, through
manufacturer representatives and distributors and through engineering contractors.  
Demand for Hamilton Sundstrand's industrial products is tied closely to the level of
general economic activity.

Hamilton Sundstrand has competitors or potential competitors in both its aerospace (as
described below) and industrial businesses.  Hamilton Sundstrand believes that its
research and development, proprietary technology, and product and service reputations have
been significant in maintaining its competitive standing.

Revenues generated by the Flight Systems segment's international operations, including
export sales, were 39 percent and  44 percent of total Flight Systems segment
revenues in 2001 and 2000, respectively.  At December 31, 2001, Flight Systems’
business backlog was $4,276 million, including $2,333 million under funded contracts and
subcontracts with the U.S. Government, as compared to $4,593 million and $2,532 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2000.  Of the total Flight Systems segment backlog at
December 31, 2001, approximately $2,791 million is expected to be realized as sales in
2002.

Pratt & Whitney and Flight Systems Aerospace
and Defense Products

The Corporation’s aerospace and
defense businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers,
foreign manufacturers (whose governments sometimes provide research and development
assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products) and
companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts.  In
particular, Pratt & Whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial
airframe/engine combinations.  Manufacturers of many aircraft offer their customers a
choice of engines at the time of sale of aircraft.  As a result, engine suppliers may
offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost
guarantees, participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements.  
Pratt & Whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are General Electric
Company and Rolls Royce plc.  The initial selections of engines and other components
by manufacturers and purchasers of new aircraft can also have a significant impact on
later sales of spare parts and maintenance services.  In addition to the terms and
conditions of sale mentioned above, the principal methods of competition in the Pratt
& Whitney and Flight Systems segments are price, product performance, service and
delivery schedule.  (For information regarding customer financing commitments,
participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and
operating cost guarantees, see Notes 4 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 17 and 24 of the Corporation's 2001 Annual Report to Shareowners.)

Other factors that can affect the
results of the Corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses include lengthy and
costly development cycles and heavy dependence on a small number of products and programs.
  Sales of military products are affected by defense budgets in the U.S. and other
countries, U.S. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations.
  Military spare parts sales are affected by policies of the U.S. and other
governments of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment
manufacturer.  Pratt & Whitney’s and Flight Systems’ operations can
also be affected by a variety of economic and other factors including those described in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position
included in the Corporation’s 2001 Annual Report to Shareowners and those described
in the Business section of this Form 10-K under the heading “Other Matters Relating
to the Corporation’s Business as a Whole”.

Significant elements of Pratt &
Whitney's and Flight Systems’ business, such as spare parts sales for engines and
aircraft in service, have short lead times.  Therefore, backlog information may not
be indicative of future demand.  Also, since a substantial portion of the backlog for
commercial customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2002, changes in economic conditions
may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled.

Other

UTC Fuel Cells, LLC (“UTC Fuel
Cells”) is a world leader in fuel cell production and development for commercial,
transportation, residential and space applications.  UTC Fuel Cells is the sole
supplier of fuel cells for U.S. space missions and also offers a commercially available
fuel cell power plant, known as the PC25™.  Over 245 PC25 units have been
delivered around the world.  Fuel cell power plants using proton exchange membrane
technology ("PEM") are currently in development for transportation, commercial
stationary, and residential applications.  UTC Fuel Cells is working with automakers
and bus manufacturers, as well as the U.S. Department of Energy, on development and
demonstration programs for automobiles.  In 2001, UTC Fuel Cells and Shell Hydrogen
US formed a joint venture to develop, manufacture and sell fuel processors and hydrogen
generation systems.

Although fuel cells are believed to be
superior to conventional power generators in terms of efficiency and environmental
characteristics, current production rates remain low across the industry.  Continued
technology advancement and wider market acceptance are required to reduce the production
cost of fuel cell components and power plants.  There is still significant
uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable PEM fuel cells will be produced.
  UTC Fuel Cells continues to seek strategic partners to develop sources of supply,
as well as marketing and distribution channels.  Toshiba Corporation owns a 10
percent equity interest in UTC Fuel Cells.

The results of UTC Fuel Cells are
included in the “Eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data
in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 24 to 25 of the
Corporation’s 2001 Annual Report to Shareowners.

Other Matters Relating to the Corporation's Business as a Whole

Research and Development

Since changes in technology can have a
significant impact on the Corporation’s operations and competitive position, the
Corporation spends substantial amounts of its own funds on research and development.
  Such expenditures, which are charged to expense as incurred, were $1,254 million or
4.6 percent of total sales in 2001, as compared with $1,302 million or 5.0 percent of
total sales in 2000 and $1,292 million or 5.4 percent of total sales in 1999.  The
Corporation also performs research and development work under contracts funded by the U.S.
Government and other customers.  Such contract research and development, which is
performed principally in the Pratt & Whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the
Flight Systems segment, amounted to $845 million in 2001, as compared with $866 million in
2000 and $963 million in 1999.

Contracts, Other Risk Factors, Environmental and
Other Matters

U.S. Government contracts are subject to
termination at the convenience of the U.S. Government, in which event the Corporation
normally would be entitled to reimbursement for its allowable costs incurred plus a
reasonable profit.  Most of the Corporation's sales are made under fixed-price type
contracts; approximately $1.1 billion of the Corporation's total sales for 2001 were made
under cost-reimbursement type contracts.

Like many defense contractors, the Corporation has received
allegations from the U.S. Government that some contract prices should be reduced because
cost or pricing data submitted in negotiation of the contract prices may not have been in
conformance with government regulations.

The Corporation
has made voluntary refunds in those cases it believes appropriate, has settled some
allegations, and does not believe that any further price reductions that may be required
will have a material effect upon its financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

The Corporation is now, and believes that in light of the current
government contracting environment it will be, the subject of one or more government
investigations.  See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings on page 8 of this Form 10-K and Note
14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 24 of the Corporation’s 2001
Annual Report to Shareowners for further discussion.  If the Corporation or one of
its business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any of these
investigations, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new
government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings.  If convicted or
found liable, the Corporation could be fined and debarred from new government contracting
for a period generally not to exceed three years.

Any
contracts found to be tainted by fraud could be voided by the Government.

The Corporation conducts its businesses through subsidiaries and
affiliates worldwide, some of which have significant minority interests.  Changes in
legislation or government policies can have an impact on the Corporation’s worldwide
operations.  For example, governmental regulation of refrigerants is important to
Carrier’s businesses, while government safety regulations, restrictions on aircraft
engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact the
Corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses.  The Corporation’s
international operations are also subject to changes in local government regulations and
policies, including those related to investments, exchange controls and repatriation of
earnings.

Some foreign customers in the
Corporation’s aerospace and defense businesses may require counter-purchase or offset
arrangements as a condition to a sale, such as requiring the Corporation to purchase
supplies in the customer’s country or to participate in manufacturing and financial
support projects.

The Corporation's operations are subject to environmental regulation
by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities
with jurisdiction over its foreign operations.  The Corporation has incurred and will
likely continue to incur liabilities under various state and federal statutes for the
cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment.  The Corporation does
not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the
environment or that any payments it may be required to make for these cleanup liabilities
will have a material adverse effect upon its cash flows, competitive position, financial
position or results of operations.  (Environmental matters are further addressed in
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position on
page 8 and Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 16 and 24
of the Corporation's 2001 Annual Report to Shareowners.)

Most of the laws governing environmental
matters include criminal provisions.  If the Corporation were convicted of a
violation of the federal Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities
involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. Government
contract awarded to the Corporation until the Environmental Protection Agency certifies
that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected.

- 6 -

While the Corporation's patents,
trademarks, licenses and franchises are cumulatively important to its business, the
Corporation does not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents,
trademarks, licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on the overall
business of the Corporation or on any of its operating segments.

Like other users in the U.S., the
Corporation is largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain of its raw materials
requirements such as cobalt (Africa), tantalum (Australia and Chile) and chromium (Africa,
Eastern and Central Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union).  To
alleviate this dependence and accompanying risk, the Corporation has a number of on-going
programs which include the development of new suppliers; the increased use of more readily
available materials through material substitutions and the development of new alloys; and
the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes
such as net shape forging.

The Corporation has sought cost
reductions in its purchases of certain other materials, components, and supplies by
consolidating its purchases, reducing the number of suppliers and using online bidding
competitions among potential suppliers.  In some instances, the Corporation is
reliant upon a single source of supply.  A disruption in deliveries from its
suppliers, therefore, could have an adverse effect on the Corporation's ability to meet
its commitments to customers.  The Corporation believes that it has appropriately
balanced the risks against the costs of sustaining a greater number of suppliers.  
The Corporation does not foresee any unavailability of materials, components, or supplies
which will have any material adverse effect on its overall business, or on any of its
business segments, in the near term.

For a discussion of other risks to which
the Corporation’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be
subject, including the risks of the Corporation’s international operations, see the
Business Section of this Form 10-K under the heading Description of Business by Segment
and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Position appearing on pages 1 through 9 of the Corporation’s 2001 Annual Report to
Shareowners.

Employees

At December 31, 2001, the Corporation's
total employment was approximately 152,000.  For discussion of the effects of the
Corporation's restructuring actions on employment, see Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position on page 4 and Note 11 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 22 to 23 of the Corporation's 2001 Annual
Report to Shareowners.

Item 2. Properties

The Corporation's fixed assets as of
December 31, 2001 include the plants and warehouses described below and a substantial
quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which is general purpose machinery and
equipment using special jigs, tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic
control features and special adaptations.  The plants, warehouses, machinery and
equipment in use as of December 31, 2001 are in good operating condition, are well
maintained, and substantially all are in regular use.

The following square footage numbers are
approximations.  At December 31, 2001, the Corporation operated (a) plants in the
U.S. which had 29.2 million square feet, of which 3.5 million square feet were leased; (b)
plants outside the U.S. which had 20.0 million square feet, of which 2.3 million square
feet were leased; (c) warehouses in the U.S. which had 10.6 million square feet, of which
6.9 million square feet were leased; and (d) warehouses outside the U.S. which had 5.9
million square feet, of which 3.7 million square feet were leased.

For discussion of the effect of the
Corporation's restructuring actions on production facilities, see Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Position on page 4 and Note 11 of
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 22 to 23 of the Corporation's 2001
Annual Report to Shareowners.

Management believes that the fixed
assets capitalized and the facilities in operation at December 31, 2001 for the production
of the Corporation's products are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein
in the current business environment, are being appropriately utilized consistent with
experience and have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes.
  Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products.  The
Corporation continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on
that review, may from time to time acquire additional facilities or dispose of existing
facilities

.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

As previously reported, the Department
of Defense and the Corporation are litigating whether Pratt & Whitney's accounting
practices  for certain engine parts are acceptable.  The litigation, filed with
the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (“ASBCA”), No. 47416 et al.,
relates to the accounting for engine parts produced by foreign companies under commercial
engine collaboration programs from 1984 through 1995.  In December 1996 the
Government claimed damages of $157.6 million, plus $102.7 million in interest through
1996.  Pratt & Whitney believes its accounting practices are proper and has not
modified them.  On July 31, 2001, the ASBCA issued a decision in favor of the
Corporation.  The Department of Defense appealed this decision to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit on November 29, 2001.  Should the Government
ultimately prevail on liability, damages could be larger than initially claimed because
the Government may amend its claim to include the period after 1995 and interest continues
to accrue on the claim asserted in 1996.

As previously reported, the Corporation
has been served with two qui tam complaints under the civil False Claims Act in United
States District Court for the District of Connecticut: U.S. ex rel. Drake v. Norden
Systems, Inc. and UTC, No. 394CV00963 (filed July 1997, and involving allegations of
improper accounting for fixed assets) and U.S. ex rel. Capella v. UTC and Norden Systems
Inc., No. 394CV02063 (filed December 1994, and involving allegations of improper
accounting for insurance costs).  The civil False Claims Act provides for penalties
in a civil case of up to $10,000 per false claim submitted.  The number of false
claims implicated by the foregoing qui tam complaints cannot currently be ascertained;
however, if determined adversely to the Corporation, the number could result in
significant penalties.  The qui tam relator in each case has claimed unspecified
damages (trebled) and penalties, and the Department of Justice in each case has declined
to take over the litigation.  In August 2000, the court dismissed portions of the
complaints.  In August 2001, the court dismissed additional claims in the

Drake

case.

In March 1999, the Department of Justice
filed a civil False Claims Act complaint against the Corporation in United States District
Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Western Division), No. C-3-99-093.  This
lawsuit is related to the “Fighter Engine Competition” between Pratt &
Whitney's F100 engine and GE's F110 engine, for contracts awarded by the U.S. Air Force
between fiscal years 1985 and 1990, inclusive.  The Government alleges that Pratt
& Whitney inflated its estimated costs for purchased parts and withheld data that
would have revealed the overstatements.  The Government seeks damages of at least $95
million (some portion of which would be trebled plus penalties of up to $10,000 per claim
submitted).

liabilities, can be found under the heading “Other Matters Relating to the
