PART I

Item 1. Business

General

United Technologies Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1934. UTC provides high technology products and services to the building systems and
aerospace industries worldwide. Growth is attributable to acquisitions and the internal development of our existing businesses. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2006 Annual Report, especially the information contained therein under the heading “Business Overview.”

Our operating units include businesses with operations throughout the world. Otis, Carrier and UTC Fire & Security (collectively referred to as
the commercial businesses) serve customers in the commercial and residential property industries worldwide. Carrier also serves commercial, industrial, transport refrigeration and food service equipment customers. Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton
Sundstrand and Sikorsky Aircraft (collectively referred to as the aerospace businesses) primarily serve commercial and government customers in the aerospace industry. Hamilton Sundstrand and Pratt & Whitney also serve customers in
industrial markets. For 2006, our commercial and industrial revenues (generated principally by our commercial businesses) were 63 percent of our consolidated revenues, and commercial aerospace and military aerospace revenues were approximately 21
percent and 16 percent, respectively, of our total revenues. Revenues for 2006 from outside the United States, including U.S. export sales, were 60 percent of our total segment revenues.

This Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge
through the Investor Relations section of our Internet website (www.utc.com) under the headings “Financials” and/or “SEC Filings” as soon as practicable after these reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Description of Business by Segment

We conduct our business through six principal segments: Otis, Carrier, UTC Fire & Security, Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand and
Sikorsky. Each segment groups similar operating companies and its management organization has general operating autonomy over a range of products and services. The principal products and services of each segment are as follows:

- 1 -


Segment financial data for the years 2004 through 2006, including financial information about foreign and
domestic operations and export sales, appears in Note 15 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in our 2006 Annual Report.

Otis

Otis is the world’s largest elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Otis designs, manufactures,
sells and installs a wide range of passenger and freight elevators for low-, medium- and high-speed applications, as well as a broad line of escalators and moving walkways. In addition to new equipment, Otis provides modernization products to
upgrade elevators and escalators as well as maintenance services for both its products and those of other manufacturers. Otis serves customers in the commercial and residential property industries around the world. Sales are made both directly to
the customers and, to a limited extent, through sales representatives and distributors.

Revenues generated by Otis’ international
operations were 80 percent of total Otis segment revenues in 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006, Otis’ business backlog was $11,583 million as compared to $10,243 million at December 31, 2005. Due to an industry-wide progression to
longer term maintenance contracts in recent years, in 2006, Otis re-evaluated the factors used to calculate service contract backlog. The backlog amounts above reflect this re-evaluation, which resulted in increased backlog figures. We believe these
figures more accurately reflect the current outstanding service contract backlog. Calculated as previously reported, backlog would have been $6,750 million and $5,807 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of the total Otis
backlog at December 31, 2006, approximately $7,200 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2007.

Carrier

Carrier is the world’s largest manufacturer and distributor of HVAC and refrigeration systems. It also produces food service equipment and HVAC and
refrigeration related controls for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation applications. Carrier also provides installation, retrofit and aftermarket services and components for the products it sells and those of other manufacturers
in the HVAC and refrigeration industries. Carrier’s products and services are sold under Carrier and other brand names to building contractors and owners, homeowners, transportation companies, retail stores and food service companies. Sales are
made both directly to the customer and through manufacturer representatives, distributors, wholesalers, dealers and retail outlets. Certain of Carrier’s HVAC businesses are seasonal and can be impacted by weather.

Revenues generated by Carrier’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 54 percent and 55 percent of total Carrier segment
revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006, Carrier’s business backlog was $1,852 million as compared to $2,099 million at December 31, 2005. Substantially all the business backlog at December 31, 2006 is
expected to be realized as sales in 2007.

UTC Fire & Security

UTC Fire & Security (UTC F&S) is a global provider of security and fire safety products and services. We created the UTC F&S segment in
the second quarter of 2005 upon acquiring Kidde plc. The UTC F&S segment includes our former Chubb segment, Kidde’s industrial, retail and commercial fire safety businesses and Lenel Systems International, Inc., a leader in the development
and delivery of scalable, integrated security software systems and business solutions. In the electronic security industry, UTC F&S provides system integration, installation and service of intruder alarms, access control systems and video
surveillance systems. In the fire safety industry, UTC F&S designs, manufactures, integrates, installs and services fire and specialty hazard detection and fixed suppression systems and manufactures, sells and services portable fire
extinguishers and other fire fighting equipment. UTC F&S also provides monitoring, response and security personnel services, including cash-in-transit security, to complement its electronic security and fire safety products. Its products and
services are used by governments, financial institutions, architects, building owners and developers, security and fire consultants and other end-users requiring a high level of security and fire protection for their businesses and residences.

UTC F&S provides its products and services under Chubb, Kidde, Lenel and other brand names and sells directly to the customer as well
as through manufacturer representatives, distributors and dealers. Revenues generated by UTC F&S’s international operations were 84 percent and 87 percent of total UTC F&S segment revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. At
December 31, 2006, UTC F&S’s business backlog was $692 million as compared to $582 million at December 31, 2005. Substantially all the business backlog at December 31, 2006 is expected to be realized as sales in 2007.

Pratt & Whitney

Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of commercial, general aviation and military aircraft engines. Pratt & Whitney’s Global Service Partners provides maintenance, repair
and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts, as well as fleet management services. Pratt & Whitney produces families of engines for wide, narrow body and military aircraft that power both Boeing and Airbus aircraft.
Pratt & Whitney also sells engines for auxiliary power units, industrial applications and space propulsion systems. Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) is a world leader for engines powering business, regional, light jet, utility and
military aircraft and helicopters. Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) is a leader in the design, development and manufacture of sophisticated aerospace propulsion systems for military and commercial applications, including the space shuttle.

In view of the risk and cost associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements
in which revenues, costs and risks are shared. At December 31, 2006, the interests of participants in current Pratt & Whitney-directed commercial jet engine production programs ranged from 14 to 29 percent. In addition,
Pratt & Whitney has interests in other programs. These include a 33 percent interest in the International Aero Engines (IAE) collaboration that sells and supports V2500 engines for the A320 family of aircraft and a 50 percent interest in
the Engine Alliance (EA) with GE Aviation to develop, market and manufacture the GP7000 engine for the A380 aircraft. At December 31, 2006, other participants held interests totaling 40 percent of Pratt & Whitney’s share of the
EA. Flight testing of the GP7000 commenced in 2006. European Aviation Safety Agency certification of the A380 aircraft with the GP7000 engines is expected in 2007, with expected entry into service in 2008.

In terms of engine development programs, Pratt & Whitney is under contract with the U.S. Air Force to develop the F135 engine, a derivative of
Pratt & Whitney’s F119 engine, to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft being developed by Lockheed Martin. In addition, Pratt & Whitney is currently developing technology, including testing of a geared turbofan,
which is intended to enable it to power the next generation A320 and 737 aircraft. Pratt & Whitney has also initiated the Advantage 70 program, which is intended to enhance its PW4000 engine for the A330 aircraft by reducing maintenance and
fuel costs and increasing thrust. PWR is developing a liquid fuel J-2x engine to support NASA’s vision for space exploration. P&WC is developing the PW600 engine series for the very light jet market. Two of the engine models have been
certified to power Cessna Aircraft’s Citation Mustang and Eclipse Aviation’s Eclipse 500. A third engine model is expected to be certified in 2007 to power the Embraer Phenom 100. P&WC is also developing the PW210 engine for
Sikorsky’s S-76D helicopter. IAE is developing the V2500 Select as a follow-on to its V2500 engine. Pratt & Whitney continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion. During 2006,
Pratt & Whitney launched Global Material Solutions (GMS), a new business that intends to engineer, certify, manufacture, sell, distribute and service new original equipment parts, including life limited parts, for CFM56

®

-3 engines.

Pratt & Whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing
companies, space launch vehicle providers and U.S. and foreign governments. The vast majority of sales are made directly to the customer and, to a limited extent, through independent distributors or foreign sales representatives. Sales to Airbus and
Boeing were 12 and 6 percent, respectively, of total Pratt & Whitney revenues in 2006, before taking into account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers. Sales to the U.S. government were 33 percent of total Pratt &
Whitney revenues in 2006.

Revenues from Pratt & Whitney’s international operations, including U.S. exports, were 53 percent
and 54 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006, Pratt & Whitney’s business backlog was $16,893 million, including $2,895 million of U.S. government funded
contracts and subcontracts, as compared to $17,834 million and $2,959 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Of the total Pratt & Whitney backlog at December 31, 2006, approximately $6,118 million is expected to be realized
as sales in 2007. During 2006, P&WC began including an estimate of the net realizable value of all future sales remaining on long term aftermarket maintenance agreements in the business backlog, consistent with Pratt & Whitney’s
practice. As these contracts are sole source and represent an increasing portion of Pratt & Whitney’s aftermarket business, management believes their inclusion provides a more accurate representation of the business backlog. Calculated
as previously reported, backlog would have been $15,836 million and $16,831 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Pratt & Whitney’s backlog includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed
total revenues. See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2006 Annual Report for a description of our accounting for long-term contracts.

Hamilton Sundstrand

Hamilton Sundstrand is among the world’s leading suppliers of technologically advanced aerospace and industrial products and aftermarket services for diversified industries worldwide. Hamilton Sundstrand’s
aerospace products, such as power generation management and distribution systems, flight systems, engine control systems, environmental control systems, fire protection and detection systems, auxiliary power units and propeller systems, serve
commercial, military, regional, business and general aviation, as well as space and undersea applications. Aftermarket services include spare parts, overhaul and repair, engineering and technical support and fleet maintenance programs. Hamilton
Sundstrand sells aerospace products to airframe manufacturers, the U.S. and foreign governments, aircraft operators and independent distributors. Hamilton Sundstrand sales of aerospace products to Boeing, Airbus and Pratt & Whitney,
collectively, including sales where the U.S. government was the ultimate customer, were 17% percent of Hamilton Sundstrand segment sales in 2006.

Hamilton Sundstrand is engaged in development programs for the Boeing 787 aircraft, the Airbus A380 aircraft, the F-35 Lightning II military aircraft and the A400M military aircraft. Hamilton Sundstrand is also the prime contractor for
NASA’s space suit/life support system and produces environmental monitoring and control, life support, mechanical systems and thermal control systems for the space shuttle, international space station and the Orion crew exploration vehicle.

Hamilton Sundstrand’s principal industrial products, such as air compressors, metering pumps and fluid handling equipment, serve
industries involved with raw material processing, bulk material handling, construction, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, and water and wastewater treatment. These products are sold under the Sullair, Sundyne, Milton Roy and other brand names
directly to end-users, through manufacturer representatives and distributors.

Revenues generated by Hamilton Sundstrand’s
international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 47 percent and 45 percent of total Hamilton Sundstrand segment revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006, Hamilton Sundstrand’s business backlog was $4,527
million, including $725 million under U.S. government funded contracts and subcontracts, as compared to $3,700 million and $708 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Of the total Hamilton Sundstrand backlog at December 31, 2006,
approximately $2,600 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2007. During 2006, Hamilton Sundstrand began including an estimate of the net realizable value of all future sales remaining on long term aftermarket maintenance agreements in the
business backlog. As these contracts are sole source and represent an increasing portion of Hamilton Sundstrand’s aftermarket business, management believes their inclusion provides a more accurate representation of the business backlog.
Calculated as previously reported, backlog would have been $3,015 million and $2,823 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Sikorsky

Sikorsky is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of military and commercial helicopters and also provides aftermarket
helicopter and aircraft parts and services.

Current production programs at Sikorsky include the UH-60L and UH-60M Black Hawk
medium-transport helicopters for the U.S. and foreign governments, the MH-60S and MH-60R helicopters for the U.S. Navy, the International Naval Hawk for multiple naval missions, and the S-76 and the S-92 helicopters for commercial operations. In
June 2005, the U.S. Army awarded Sikorsky a low rate initial production contract for new UH-60M Black Hawk advanced utility helicopters. This contract is the last phase before the Army makes the full rate production decision. In April 2006, Sikorsky
was awarded a System Development and Demonstration contract for the U.S. Marine Corps CH-53K next generation heavy lift helicopter. Development of the H-92 helicopter for military markets and the S-76D helicopter, which is expected to be the next
generation of the S-76 helicopter, is in process.

In December 2006, Sikorsky entered into an agreement to acquire the Polish aircraft
manufacturer, PZL Mielec, which is intended to form the foundation for Sikorsky’s European operations. This acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2007, subject to regulatory and other customary conditions.

Sikorsky’s aftermarket business includes spare parts sales, overhaul and repair services, maintenance contracts, and logistics support programs for
helicopters and other aircraft. Sales are made directly by Sikorsky and by its subsidiaries and joint ventures. Sikorsky is increasingly engaging in logistics support programs and partnering with its government and commercial customers to manage and
provide maintenance and repair services.

- 4 -


Revenues generated by Sikorsky’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 34
percent and 31 percent of total Sikorsky revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006, Sikorsky’s business backlog was $8,789 million, including $3,257 million under U.S. government funded contracts and subcontracts, as
compared to $7,531 million and $2,261 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. Of the total Sikorsky backlog at December 31, 2006, approximately $3,800 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2007.

Other

UTC Power develops and markets distributed
generation power systems and fuel cell power plants for stationary, transportation, space and defense applications. UTC Power’s three primary distributed generation product lines, PureCell 200 fuel cell power plants, PureComfort combined
cooling, heat and power systems and PureCycle geothermal organic Rankine cycle power systems, are designed to provide reliable, efficient and environmentally responsible energy solutions for customers.

UTC Power’s automotive and bus transportation fuel cell power plants are based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology, including its
PureMotion 120 power plant, which is currently used in revenue service in transit bus applications. UTC Power is currently developing PEM fuel cells for submarine applications. UTC Power’s alkaline-based fuel cells are used on NASA’s space
shuttle program.

Although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of efficiency and
environmental characteristics, the technology is still in development and continued technology advancement and cost reduction of key fuel cell components are required to achieve wide-scale market acceptance. Government support is needed to advance
fuel cell technology to a truly commercial stage. There is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable PEM fuel cells will be produced.

UTC Power and its related UTC Fuel Cells unit merged effective January 1, 2007. The results of UTC Power and UTC Fuel Cells are included in the “Eliminations and other” category in the segment financial
data in Note 15 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in our 2006 Annual Report.

Other Matters Relating to Our
Business as a Whole

Competition and Other Factors Affecting Our Businesses

As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic and other factors, including those described in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2006 Annual Report, in this Item 1 under the heading “Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole”, in Item 1A. “Risk
Factors” and in “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” in this Form 10-K. Each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the United States and other countries,
and each competes on the basis of price, delivery schedule, product performance and service.

Our aerospace businesses are subject to
substantial competition from domestic manufacturers, foreign manufacturers (whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their commercial products) and companies that obtain
regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. In particular, Pratt & Whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframe/engine combinations. Engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial
incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements. Customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services. In
addition, the U.S. and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Significant elements of our aerospace businesses, such as spare parts sales
for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. Therefore, backlog information may not be indicative of future demand. Pratt & Whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are GE Aviation and Rolls Royce plc. For
information regarding customer financing commitments, participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees, see Notes 4 and 13 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in our
2006 Annual Report.

Research and Development

Since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position, we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development. These expenditures, which are charged to expense as incurred,
were $1,529 million, or 3.2 percent of total sales in 2006, as compared with $1,367 million or 3.2 percent of total

- 5 -


sales in 2005 and $1,267 million or 3.5 percent of total sales in 2004. We also perform research and development work
under contracts funded by the U.S. government and other customers. This contract research and development, which is performed principally in the Pratt & Whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the Hamilton Sundstrand and Sikorsky
segments, amounted to $1,952 million in 2006, as compared with $1,650 million in 2005 and $1,619 million in 2004. These contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred, through cost of products sold, and amounts
that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production aircraft shipments. Of the totals, $1,621 million, $1,478 million and $1,585 million were expensed in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The remaining costs have
been capitalized.

U.S. Government Contracts

U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for
convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the
government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Most of our U.S. government sales are made under fixed-price type contracts, while approximately $2.1 billion of our total sales for
2006 were made under cost-reimbursement type contracts.

Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to audits. Like many
defense contractors, we have received audit reports from the U.S. government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not
have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports have involved substantial amounts. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and we continue to litigate certain cases.
For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see the discussion in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” in this Form 10-K and Note 14 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” in our 2006 Annual Report for further discussion.

Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations

Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory
authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. We do not anticipate
that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows, competitive position, financial
condition or results of operations. Environmental matters are further addressed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 1 and 14 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” in our 2006 Annual Report.

Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were
convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental
Protection Agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected.

We conduct our businesses through
subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. Changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations. For example, governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards, elevator safety codes and fire safety
regulations are important to the businesses of Carrier, Otis and UTC F&S respectively, while government safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our
aerospace businesses.

Intellectual Property and Raw Materials

We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. While this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business, we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of
related patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our operating segments.

We believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials, components, services and supplies used in our manufacturing. We work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to
reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating our purchases, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers. In some
instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials
requirements such as cobalt (Finland, Norway, Russia and Canada), tantalum (Australia and Canada), chromium (South Africa, Kazakhstan, Zimbabwe and Russia) and rhenium (Chile, Kazakhstan and Germany). We have a number of ongoing programs to manage

- 6 -


this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing
processes. We believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses
(steel, copper, aluminum, titanium and nickel) have caused margin and cost pressures, we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies that would have an adverse effect on our business, or on any of our business
segments. For further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.

Employees and Employee Relations

At December 31, 2006, our total employment was approximately
214,500, approximately 66 percent of which represents employees based outside the United States. During 2006, we renegotiated twenty multi-year collective bargaining agreements, the largest of which covered certain workers at Sikorsky and Carrier.
In 2007, numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation, the largest of which cover certain workers at Hamilton Sundstrand, Otis and Pratt & Whitney. We do not anticipate any problems in renegotiating these contracts
that would either individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. For discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment, see “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in our 2006 Annual Report.

For a discussion of other matters which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including the risks of our international operations, see the further discussion under the headings
“General” and “Description of Business by Segment” in this section and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” in our 2006 Annual Report.

All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. For additional information identifying factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on
Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. This Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2006 includes important information as to these factors in the “Business” section under the headings
“General”, “Description of Business by Segment” and “Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole” and in the “Risk Factors” and “Legal Proceedings” sections. Additional important information as
to these factors is included in our 2006 Annual Report in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be
impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. For a discussion identifying
additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see the discussion in “Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole” and “Cautionary Note Concerning
Factors That May Affect Future Results” in this Form 10-K and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in our 2006
Annual Report.

Our Financial Performance Is Dependent on the Conditions of the Aerospace and Construction Industries

The results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated 37 percent of our revenues in 2006, are directly tied to the economic
conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries. The aviation industry is cyclical, and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic
levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits and backlog levels. Also,
since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2007, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. In addition, our
aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. The defense industry is also affected by a changing global political environment, continued pressure on U.S. and global defense
spending and U.S. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. Spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, regulatory changes, the retirement of older
aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic
conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. A reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial
performance or results of operations.

The results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated 63 percent of our revenues
in 2006, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs and
other global and political factors. In addition to these factors, Carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, in its residential business, weather conditions.

Our Business May Be Affected by Government Contracting Risks

U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by
the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. We are now, and believe that in light of the
current U.S. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more U.S. government investigations. If we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any U.S. government investigations
(including violation of certain environmental or export laws), the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the
U.S. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages. The U.S. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from
receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years. Independently, failure to comply with U.S. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and
technology outside the U.S. could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges.

Our International Operations Subject Us to Economic Risk As Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by
Foreign Currency Fluctuations and Changes in Local Government Regulation

We conduct our business on a global basis, with 60 percent
of our total 2006 segment revenues derived from operations outside of the United States and from U.S. export sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand in export markets and affect reported profits of our non-U.S. operations
(primarily the commercial businesses) where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. Our financial statements are
denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements on non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. dollars. Given that the majority of our
revenues are non-U.S. based, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation,
exchange controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic
instability. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. For example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require
us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. The contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. In
addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa, that carry high levels of currency, political and economic risk. While these factors or the
impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.

We Use a Variety of Raw Materials, Supplier Provided Parts, Components, Sub-Systems and Third Party Contract Manufacturing Services in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages, Supplier Capacity Constraints, Supplier Production
Disruptions or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products

Our reliance on suppliers, third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials.
In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract
manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our
commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price
increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

We Engage in Acquisitions, and May Encounter Difficulties Integrating Acquired Businesses with Our Current Operations; Therefore, We May Not Realize the
Anticipated Benefits of the Acquisitions

We seek to grow through strategic acquisitions. In the past several years, we have made
various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and may continue to do so in the future. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and
personnel acquired in these transactions, apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, and cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, and in managing
strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We Design, Manufacture and Service Products that Incorporate Advanced Technologies; The Introduction of New
Products and Technologies Involves Risks and We May Not Realize the Degree or Timing of Benefits Initially Anticipated

We seek to
achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. We regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a
wide range of technologies, products and services. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules;
execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of internal and supplier produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; achieving cost and production efficiencies and validation of innovative
technologies. These factors involve significant risks and uncertainties. We may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. In
particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities Pratt & Whitney or its affiliates will produce aircraft engines currently in development or pending required certifications. Any of the foregoing could
adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We Are Subject to Litigation and Legal Compliance Risks That Could Adversely Affect Our
Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things,
litigation concerning product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, compliance with competition laws and sales and trading practices. While we believe we have adopted
appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from
time to time. Our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we estimate material loss contingencies and
establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings
may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability
would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. For a description of current legal proceedings, see Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” in this Form 10-K.

Item 2. Properties

For purposes of this table, emerging markets include the countries included in the Morgan Stanley Capital International
Emerging Markets Global Index

SM

.

Our fixed assets as of December 31, 2006 include the manufacturing facilities and non-manufacturing facilities such as warehouses set forth in the
tables above and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which are general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs, tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The
facilities, warehouses, machinery and equipment in use as of December 31, 2006 are in good operating condition, are well maintained and substantially all are in regular use.

Our management believes that the fixed assets capitalized and the facilities in operation at December 31, 2006 for the production of our products
are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein in the current business environment and have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the products. We
continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time adjust our facility needs.

For discussion of the effect of our restructuring actions on manufacturing facilities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 11 of “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” in our 2006 Annual Report.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

As previously reported, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sued us in 1999 in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, claiming that Pratt & Whitney violated the civil False Claims Act and common law. This lawsuit relates to the “Fighter Engine Competition” between Pratt &
Whitney’s F100 engine and GE’s F110 engine. The DOJ alleges that the government overpaid for F100 engines under contracts awarded by the U.S. Air Force in fiscal years 1985 through 1990 because Pratt & Whitney inflated its
estimated costs for some purchased parts and withheld data that would have revealed the overstatements. Treble damages and penalties of up to $10,000 per false claim could be assessed if the court finds that Pratt & Whitney violated the
civil False Claims Act, and common law damages would accrue pre-judgment interest. Trial of this matter was completed in December 2004. At trial, the government claimed Pratt & Whitney’s liability is $624 million. We believe that this
estimate is substantially overstated, denied any liability and vigorously defended against the DOJ’s claims. A decision is pending. Should the government ultimately prevail with respect to the foregoing government contract matter, the outcome
could result in a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. However, we believe that the resolution of this matter will not have a
material adverse effect upon our competitive position, cash flows or financial condition.

As previously reported, the European
Commission’s Competition Directorate (EU Commission) conducted inspections in early 2004 at offices of our Otis subsidiary in Berlin, Brussels, Luxembourg and Paris relating to an investigation of possible unlawful collusive arrangements
involving the European elevator and escalator industry. Based on the results of our own internal investigation, we believe that some Otis employees engaged in activities at a local level in Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Germany in
violation of Otis and UTC policies and European competition law. On October 13, 2005, we received a Statement of Objections (SO) from the EU Commission relating to this investigation. The SO, an administrative complaint, alleges infringements
of EU competition rules by certain elevator companies, including Otis, in Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Germany. We responded to the SO on February 21, 2006 and have cooperated fully with the EU Commission. We expect the EU
Commission to issue a decision in the near term, but cannot reasonably estimate the range of civil fines to which we or Otis would likely be subject. The aggregate amount of such fines could be material to our operating results for the period in
which the liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which the fines would be paid. We do not believe that any such fines would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, or that the resolution of this matter would
have a material adverse effect on Otis’ competitive position.

Since the EU Commission’s investigation became public, class
action lawsuits were filed in various federal district courts in the United States alleging that we, Otis and other elevator manufacturers engaged in violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Those lawsuits were transferred to and
consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On June 6, 2006, the district court judge granted our motion to dismiss without leave to replead. On June 30, 2006, the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We expect a decision in the second or third quarter of 2007. We continue to believe this litigation is without merit.

As previously reported, in December 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency executed a search warrant at Hamilton Sundstrand seeking records and data regarding processes for monitoring, treating and discharging
wastewater at a Connecticut manufacturing facility. Hamilton Sundstrand also received a Notice of Violation associated with the same matter from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. On February 8, 2007 Hamilton Sundstrand pled
guilty to a two-count Federal criminal information alleging that it violated the Clean Water Act by filing inaccurate reports of hexavalent chrome levels at an internal sampling point from 2001 to 2003, and by discharging wastewater containing an
excessive amount of copper into the Farmington River. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Hamilton Sundstrand will pay a $1 million penalty and be placed on probation for a five year period. Over this period, Hamilton Sundstrand will also contribute to
and perform $11 million of projects to benefit the environment and take a number of actions with respect to environmental training, compliance, oversight, reporting and auditing. Hamilton Sundstrand also entered into a Consent Order with the
Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection to resolve the related Notice of Violation. Under the Consent Order, Hamilton Sundstrand will pay an additional $75,000 fine, and $675,000 of the $11 million in projects described above will be
designated to resolve its liability under the Notice of Violation.

In 2005, the Korean Fair Trade Commission conducted an inspection at
the office of Otis’ Korean subsidiary in connection with an investigation of possible unlawful collusive arrangements in the Korean elevator industry. Based on the results of our internal investigation, we believe that some employees at this
subsidiary engaged in activities at a local level in violation of Otis and UTC policies and Korean competition law. We are cooperating fully with the investigation. We do not believe that any fines that may be imposed will be material to UTC or have
a materially adverse impact on Otis’ competitive position.

As previously reported, like many other companies in recent years, we or
our subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of our products or premises. While we have never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporate it in
any currently manufactured products, certain of our historical products, like those of many other manufacturers, have contained components incorporating asbestos. We have made no payment in a substantial majority of the cases closed to date. The
remainder of the resolved

- 12 -


cases have settled for amounts that are not material to us, and have been supported in part by insurance. At present, we
are named in approximately 2,830 lawsuits involving approximately 15,365 individual claimants. In our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, we reported that approximately 18,000 claimants were then joined in lawsuits in
Mississippi state courts. Typically, these Mississippi lawsuits named from 200 to 400 other companies as defendants along with us or our subsidiaries. The complaints did not identify any of our products or products of our subsidiaries, or specify
the amount of damages claimed. In addition, the complaints did not allege which claimants, if any, were exposed to asbestos attributable to our products or premises, nor the extent, if any, to which such claimants had been harmed. Since our 2004
report, as a result of changes in the law governing joinder and pleading in Mississippi, approximately 5,700 Mississippi claimants have been transferred to the Federal Multidistrict Litigation asbestos docket in Pennsylvania. Many other claimants
have been dismissed without prejudice and required to file claims, if they can, that allege more specifically the claimant’s exposure to asbestos and the resulting harm. At present, the total number of claimants in Mississippi is approximately
4,955.

Except as otherwise noted above, we do not believe that resolution of any of the legal matters discussed above will have a material
adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. A further discussion of government contracts and related investigations, as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities, can be found
under the heading “Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole – Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations” in Item 1 “Business” and in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form

On December 13, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
60 million shares of our common stock. Shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or both. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we entered into a stock repurchase plan under which a broker repurchases shares of
our common stock on our behalf pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These repurchases are included within the scope of our overall repurchase program discussed above. We may also reacquire shares
outside of the program in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock. Approximately 7,000 shares were reacquired in transactions outside the program during the quarter.

In June 2006 and May 2005, we contributed 2,497,919 and 3,000,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, valued at $150 million and $157 million,
respectively, to our U.S. defined pension plans, in accordance with Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. These contributions will reduce our future obligations to fund the plans.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Operating Officer, the Vice President, Accounting and Finance; Controller and the Vice
President, Finance, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the

- 15 -


effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer, our President and Chief Operating Officer, our Vice President, Accounting and Finance; Controller and our Vice President, Finance concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that
it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our President and Chief Operating Officer, our Vice President, Accounting and Finance; Controller and our Vice President, Finance, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

Our management concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in our 2006 Annual Report.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
