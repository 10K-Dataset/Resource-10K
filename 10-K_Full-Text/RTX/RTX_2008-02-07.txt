PART I

Item 1. Business

General

United Technologies Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1934. UTC provides high technology products and services to the building systems and
aerospace industries worldwide. Growth is attributable to acquisitions and the internal development of our existing businesses. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2007 Annual Report, especially the information contained therein under the heading “Business Overview.”

Our operating units include businesses with operations throughout the world. Otis, Carrier and UTC Fire & Security (collectively referred to as
the commercial businesses) serve customers in the commercial and residential property industries worldwide. Carrier also serves commercial, industrial, transport refrigeration and food service equipment customers. Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton
Sundstrand and Sikorsky (collectively referred to as the aerospace businesses) primarily serve commercial and government customers in the aerospace industry. Hamilton Sundstrand and Pratt & Whitney also serve customers in industrial
markets. For 2007, our commercial and industrial revenues (generated principally by our commercial businesses) were approximately 63 percent of our consolidated revenues, and commercial aerospace and military aerospace revenues were approximately 21
percent and 16 percent, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Revenues for 2007 from outside the United States, including U.S. export sales, were 62 percent of our total segment revenues.

This Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge
through the Investor Relations section of our Internet website (www.utc.com) under the headings “Financials” and/or “SEC Filings” as soon as practicable after these reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our SEC filings are also available for reading and copying at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may
be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) containing reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the
SEC.

Description of Business by Segment

We conduct our business through six principal segments: Otis, Carrier, UTC Fire & Security, Pratt & Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand and Sikorsky. Each segment groups similar operating companies and the
management organization of each segment has general operating autonomy over a range of products and services. The principal products and services of each segment are as follows:

- 1 -


Sikorsky

—military and commercial helicopters, aftermarket helicopter and aircraft parts and services.

Segment financial data for the years 2005 through 2007, including financial information about
foreign and domestic operations and export sales, appears in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2007 Annual Report.

Otis

Otis is the world’s largest elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Otis designs, manufactures,
sells and installs a wide range of passenger and freight elevators for low-, medium- and high-speed applications, as well as a broad line of escalators and moving walkways. In addition to new equipment, Otis provides modernization products to
upgrade elevators and escalators as well as maintenance services for both its products and those of other manufacturers. Otis serves customers in the commercial and residential property industries around the world. Otis sells directly to the end
customer and, to a limited extent, through sales representatives and distributors.

Revenues generated by Otis’ international
operations were 81 percent and 80 percent of total Otis segment revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, Otis undertook a re-evaluation of the
factors used to calculate service contract backlog in light of an industry-wide progression to longer term maintenance contracts. The adjustment to these factors resulted in an increase to backlogs reported for both 2006 and 2005. During 2007, Otis
made system enhancements at several locations enabling the backlog calculations at those locations to be made on a contract-by-contract basis to provide a more precise calculation of the Otis backlog. These enhancements resulted in further
adjustments to the backlog. As currently calculated, Otis’ backlog at December 31, 2007 is $14,146 million as compared to $12,549 million at December 31, 2006. Calculated as previously reported, Otis’ backlog at December 31,
2006 was $11,583 million. Of the total Otis backlog at December 31, 2007, approximately $8,167 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2008.

Carrier

Carrier is the world’s largest manufacturer and distributor of HVAC and refrigeration systems. It also
produces food service equipment and HVAC and refrigeration-related controls for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation applications. Carrier also provides installation, retrofit and aftermarket services and components for the
products it sells and those of other manufacturers in the HVAC and refrigeration industries. Carrier’s products and services are sold under Carrier and other brand names to building contractors and owners, homeowners, transportation companies,
retail stores and food service companies. Carrier sells directly to the end customer and through manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, wholesalers, dealers and retail outlets. Certain of Carrier’s HVAC businesses are seasonal and
can be impacted by weather.

Revenues generated by Carrier’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 59 percent
and 54 percent of total Carrier segment revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, Carrier’s business backlog was $2,097 million as compared to $1,852 million at December 31, 2006. Substantially all the business
backlog at December 31, 2007 is expected to be realized as sales in 2008.

UTC Fire & Security

UTC Fire & Security (UTC F&S) is a global provider of security and fire safety products and services. We created the UTC F&S segment in
the second quarter of 2005 upon acquiring Kidde, adding the Kidde industrial, retail and commercial fire safety businesses to the former Chubb segment. In the electronic security industry, UTC F&S provides system integration, installation and
service of intruder alarms, access control systems and video surveillance systems under several brand names including Chubb. In the fire safety industry, UTC F&S designs, manufactures, integrates, installs, sells and services a wide range of
specialty hazard detection and fixed suppression products and systems and manufactures, sells and services portable fire extinguishers and other fire fighting equipment under several brand names including Kidde. UTC F&S also provides monitoring,
response and security personnel services, including cash-in-transit security, to complement its electronic security and fire safety businesses. Its products and services are used by governments, financial institutions, architects, building owners
and developers, security and fire consultants and other end-users requiring a high level of security and fire protection for their businesses and residences.

In the third quarter of 2007, we completed the acquisition of Initial Electronic Security Group (IESG), a division of Rentokil Initial, plc, with the exception of the French operations, the acquisition of which we
completed during the fourth quarter of 2007. IESG is being integrated into the UTC F&S segment and is expected to enhance UTC F&S’s scale and capability in the electronic security business in key markets where UTC F&S has a
significant presence. In the third quarter of 2007, we also completed the acquisition of Marioff Corporation Oy, a global provider of water mist suppression systems for land and marine applications.

- 2 -


UTC F&S provides its products and services under Chubb, Kidde, Lenel and other brand names and sells
directly to the customer as well as through manufacturer representatives, distributors and dealers. Revenues generated by UTC F&S’s international operations were 82 percent and 84 percent of total UTC F&S segment revenues in 2007 and
2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, UTC F&S’s business backlog was $1,084 million as compared to $692 million at December 31, 2006. Substantially all the business backlog at December 31, 2007 is expected to be realized
as sales in 2008.

Pratt & Whitney

Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of commercial, general aviation and military aircraft engines. Pratt & Whitney’s Global Service Partners provides maintenance, repair and overhaul services,
including the sale of spare parts, as well as fleet management services for large commercial engines. Pratt & Whitney produces families of engines for wide, narrow body and military aircraft. Pratt & Whitney also sells engines for
auxiliary power units, industrial applications and space propulsion systems. Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) is a world leader for engines powering business, regional, light jet, utility and military aircraft and helicopters.
Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) is a leader in the design, development and manufacture of sophisticated aerospace propulsion systems for military and commercial applications, including the space shuttle.

In view of the risk and cost associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which
revenues, costs and risks are shared. At December 31, 2007, the interests of participants in current Pratt & Whitney-directed commercial jet engine production programs ranged from 14 percent to 29 percent. In addition, Pratt &
Whitney has interests in other engine programs, including a 33 percent interest in the International Aero Engines (IAE) collaboration that sells and supports V2500 engines for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. At December 31, 2007,
Pratt & Whitney sub-partners held interests equivalent to 4 percent of the overall IAE collaboration. Pratt & Whitney also has a 50 percent interest in the Engine Alliance (EA) (a joint venture with GE Aviation) to develop, market
and manufacture the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. At December 31, 2007, other participants held interests totaling 40 percent of Pratt & Whitney’s 50 percent share of the EA. Flight testing of the GP7000 commenced in
2006. European Aviation Safety Agency and Federal Aviation Authority type certification of the Airbus A380 aircraft with the GP7000 engines occurred in December 2007, with entry into service expected in 2008.

In terms of engine development programs, Pratt & Whitney is under contract with the U.S.
Air Force to develop the F135 engine, a derivative of Pratt & Whitney’s F119 engine, to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft being developed by Lockheed Martin. In addition, Pratt & Whitney is currently
developing technology, including testing of a geared turbofan engine, which is intended to enable it to power proposed and future aircraft. Pratt & Whitney has also initiated the Advantage 70 program, which is intended to enhance its PW4000
engine for the Airbus A330 aircraft by reducing maintenance and fuel costs and increasing thrust. PWR is developing a liquid fuel J-2x engine to support NASA’s vision for space exploration. P&WC is developing the PW600 engine series for the
very light jet market. Three of these P&WC PW600 engine models have been selected to power Cessna Aircraft’s Citation Mustang, Eclipse Aviation’s Eclipse 500 and Embraer’s Phenom 100. P&WC is also developing the PW210 engine
for Sikorsky’s S-76D helicopter. IAE is developing the V2500Select

®

program as an enhancement to its V2500 engine. Pratt & Whitney continues to enhance its programs through
performance improvement measures and product base expansion. During 2006, Pratt & Whitney launched Global Material Solutions (GMS), a new business that is in the process of engineering, certifying, manufacturing and selling new parts,
including life limited parts, for CFM56

®

-3 engines.

Pratt &
Whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies, space launch vehicle providers and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s products
and services must adhere to strict regulatory and market driven safety and performance standards. The frequently changing nature of these standards, along with the long duration of aircraft engine programs, create uncertainty regarding engine
program profitability. The vast majority of sales are made directly to the end customer and, to a limited extent, using independent distributors and service providers. Sales to Airbus and Boeing were 9.5 and 6.4 percent, respectively, of total
Pratt & Whitney revenues in 2007, before taking into account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers. Sales to the U.S. government were 29.5 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment revenues in 2007.

Revenues from Pratt & Whitney’s international operations, including U.S. exports, were 56 percent and 53 percent of total Pratt &
Whitney segment revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, Pratt & Whitney’s business backlog was $23,607 million, including $5,334 million of U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts, as compared to
$16,893 million and $2,895 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Of the total Pratt & Whitney backlog at December 31, 2007, approximately $6,882 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2008. Pratt &
Whitney’s backlog includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total revenues from these contracts. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2007 Annual Report for a description of our accounting for
long-term contracts.

Hamilton Sundstrand

Hamilton Sundstrand is among the world’s leading suppliers of technologically advanced aerospace and industrial products and aftermarket services for diversified industries worldwide. Hamilton Sundstrand’s
aerospace products, such as power generation management and distribution systems, flight systems, engine control systems, environmental control systems, fire protection and detection systems, auxiliary power units and propeller systems, serve
commercial, military, regional, business and general aviation, as well as space and undersea applications. Aftermarket services include spare parts, overhaul and repair, engineering and technical support and fleet maintenance programs. Hamilton
Sundstrand sells aerospace products to airframe manufacturers, the U.S. and foreign governments, aircraft operators and independent distributors. Hamilton Sundstrand sales of aerospace products to Boeing, Airbus and Pratt & Whitney,
collectively, including sales where the U.S. government was the ultimate customer, were 16.6 percent of Hamilton Sundstrand segment sales in 2007.

Hamilton Sundstrand is engaged in development programs for the Boeing 787 aircraft, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II military aircraft and the Airbus A400M military aircraft, and has developed and delivered systems for the Airbus A380
aircraft. Hamilton Sundstrand is also the prime contractor for NASA’s space suit/life support system and produces environmental monitoring and control, life support, mechanical systems and thermal control systems for the space shuttle,
international space station and the Orion crew exploration vehicle.

Hamilton Sundstrand’s principal industrial products, such as air
compressors, metering pumps and fluid handling equipment, serve industries involved with raw material processing, bulk material handling, construction, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, and water and wastewater treatment. Hamilton Sundstrand
sells these products under the Sullair, Sundyne, Milton Roy and other brand names directly to end-users, and through manufacturer representatives and distributors.

Revenues generated by Hamilton Sundstrand’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 50 percent and 47 percent of total Hamilton Sundstrand segment revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. At
December 31, 2007, Hamilton Sundstrand’s business backlog was $5,152 million, including $823 million under U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts, as compared to $4,527 million and $725 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2006. Of the total Hamilton Sundstrand backlog at December 31, 2007, approximately $2,761 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2008.

Sikorsky

Sikorsky is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of military and commercial
helicopters and also provides aftermarket helicopter and aircraft parts and services.

Current major production programs at Sikorsky
include the UH-60L and UH-60M Black Hawk medium-transport helicopters for the U.S. and foreign governments, the MH-60S and MH-60R helicopters for the U.S. Navy, the International Naval Hawk for multiple naval missions, and the S-76 and S-92
helicopters for commercial operations. In December 2007, the U.S. government and Sikorsky signed a five-year multi-service contract for 537 H-60 helicopters to be delivered to the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. Actual production quantities will be
determined year-by-year over the life of the program based on funding allocations set by Congress and Pentagon acquisition priorities. In April 2006, Sikorsky was awarded a System Development and Demonstration contract for the U.S. Marine Corps
CH-53K next generation heavy lift helicopter. Development of the H-92 helicopter for military markets and the S-76D helicopter, which is expected to be the next generation of the S-76 helicopter, is in process.

In March 2007, UTC acquired the Polish aircraft manufacturer, PZL Mielec, which is intended to form the foundation for Sikorsky’s European
operations. Sikorsky’s aftermarket business includes spare parts sales, overhaul and repair services, maintenance contracts, and logistics support programs for helicopters and other aircraft. Sales are made directly by Sikorsky and by its
subsidiaries and joint ventures. Sikorsky is increasingly engaging in logistics support programs and partnering with its government and commercial customers to manage and provide maintenance and repair services.

Revenues generated by Sikorsky’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 34 percent of total Sikorsky revenues in 2007 and in
2006. At December 31, 2007, Sikorsky’s business backlog was $11,445 million, including $5,180 million under U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts, as compared to $8,789 million and $3,257 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2006. Of the total Sikorsky backlog at December 31, 2007, approximately $5,116 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2008.

Other

UTC Power develops and markets distributed generation power systems and fuel cell power plants for stationary, transportation, space and defense applications. UTC Power’s three primary distributed generation product lines, PureCell 200
fuel cell power plants, PureComfort combined cooling, heat and power systems and PureCycle geothermal organic Rankine cycle power systems, are designed to provide reliable, efficient and environmentally responsible energy solutions for customers.

UTC Power’s automotive and bus transportation fuel cell power plants are based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology,
including its PureMotion 120 power plant, which is currently used in revenue service in transit bus applications. UTC Power is currently developing PEM fuel cells for submarine applications. UTC Power’s alkaline-based fuel cells are used on
NASA’s space shuttle program.

Although fuel cells are believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms
of efficiency and environmental characteristics, the technology is still in development and continued technology advancement and cost reduction of key fuel cell components are required to achieve wide-scale market acceptance. Government support is
needed to advance fuel cell technology to a truly commercial stage. There is still significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable PEM fuel cells will be produced.

UTC Power merged with UTC Fuel Cells, effective January 1, 2007, with UTC Power continuing as the surviving entity. The results of UTC Power and UTC
Fuel Cells are included in the “Eliminations and Other” category in the segment financial data in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2007 Annual Report.

Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole

Competition and Other Factors Affecting
Our Businesses

As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic and other factors, including those
described in this section, in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2007 Annual Report, in Item I, “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future
Results,” and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the United States and other countries, and each competes on the basis of
price, delivery schedule, product performance and service.

Our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic
manufacturers, foreign manufacturers (whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their national commercial products) and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to
manufacture spare parts. In particular, Pratt & Whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframe/engine combinations. Engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and
operating cost guarantees, participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements. Customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S.
government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Significant elements of our aerospace businesses, such as spare parts sales
for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. Therefore, backlog information may not be indicative of future demand. Pratt & Whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are GE Aviation and Rolls-Royce. For
information regarding customer financing commitments, participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees, see Notes 4 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2007 Annual
Report.

Research and Development

Since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position, we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development. These expenditures, which are charged to expense as incurred,
were $1,678 million, or 3.1 percent of total sales in 2007, as compared with $1,529 million or 3.2 percent of total sales in 2006 and $1,367 million or 3.2 percent of total sales in 2005. We also perform research and development work under contracts
funded by the U.S. government and other customers. This contract research and development, which is performed principally in the Pratt & Whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the Hamilton Sundstrand and Sikorsky segments, amounted to
$2,123 million in 2007, as compared to $1,952 million in 2006 and $1,650 million in 2005. These contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred, through cost of products sold, and amounts that are capitalized
into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production aircraft shipments. Of the totals, $1,872 million, $1,621 million and $1,478 million were expensed in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The remaining costs have been capitalized.

- 5 -


U.S. Government Contracts

U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a
termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for
additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Most of our U.S. government sales are made under fixed-price type contracts, while approximately $2,221 million
or 4.1 percent of our total sales for 2007 were made under cost-reimbursement type contracts.

Our contracts with the U.S. government are
also subject to audits. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports from the U.S. government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or
cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports have involved substantial reductions. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and
continue to litigate certain cases. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see the discussion in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K and Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2007 Annual Report for further discussion.

Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations

Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and
regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. We do not
anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows, competitive position,
financial condition or results of operations. Environmental matters are further addressed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2007 Annual Report.

Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were
convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental
Protection Agency certified that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected.

We conduct our businesses through
subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. Changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations. For example, governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards, elevator safety codes and fire safety
regulations are important to the businesses of Carrier, Otis and UTC F&S respectively, while government safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our
aerospace businesses.

Intellectual Property and Raw Materials

We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. While this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business, we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of
related patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our operating segments.

We believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials, components, services and supplies used in our manufacturing. We work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to
reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating our purchases, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and using online bidding competitions among potential suppliers. In some
instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Like other users in the United States, we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for
certain raw materials requirements such as cobalt (Finland, Norway, Russia and Canada), tantalum (Australia and Canada), chromium (South Africa, Kazakhstan, Zimbabwe and Russia) and rhenium (Chile, Kazakhstan and Germany). We have a number of
ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. We believe that our supply management practices are
based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Although recent high prices for some raw materials important to some of our businesses (steel, copper, aluminum, titanium and nickel) have caused
margin and cost pressures, we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies that would have an adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our business segments. For further discussion of the possible
effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.

- 6 -


Employees and Employee Relations

At December 31, 2007, our total employment was approximately 225,600, approximately 66 percent of which represents employees based outside the United States. During 2007, we renegotiated twenty-two multi-year
collective bargaining agreements, the largest of which covered certain workers at Otis and Pratt & Whitney. In 2008, numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation, the largest of which cover certain workers at
Carrier and Hamilton Sundstrand. We do not anticipate any problems in renegotiating these contracts that would either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. For discussion
of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2007 Annual Report.

For a discussion of other matters which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, including the risks of
our international operations, see the further discussion under the headings “General” and “Description of Business by Segment” in this section, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K, and under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2007 Annual Report.

Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results

This Form 10-K contains statements which, to
the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact, constitute “forward-looking statements” under the securities laws. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements may also be included in other materials

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Our business, financial condition,
operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future
results. For a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see the discussion in “Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole” and
“Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” in this Form 10-K and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” in our 2007 Annual Report.

Our Financial Performance Is Dependent on the Conditions of the Aerospace and Construction Industries

The results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 37 percent of our consolidated
revenues in 2007, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries. The aerospace industry is cyclical, and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a wide variety of
factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions,
worldwide airline profits, corporate profitability and backlog levels. Also, since a substantial portion of the backlog for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2008, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to
request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. At times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that
arise during the development stage of the program. In addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. The defense industry is also affected by a changing global
political environment, continued pressure on U.S. and global defense spending and U.S. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. Spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors,
including usage, pricing, regulatory changes, the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products
in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. A reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for
our products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations.

The results of our commercial and
industrial businesses, which generated approximately 63 percent of our revenues in 2007, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, interest rates, labor costs, foreign
currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs and other global and political factors. In addition to these factors, Carrier’s financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport
equipment and, in its residential business, weather conditions.

Our Business May Be Affected by Government Contracting Risks

U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our
failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other
damages it suffers. We are now, and believe that in light of the current U.S. government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of one or more U.S. government investigations. If we or one of our business units were charged with
wrongdoing as a result of any U.S. government investigation (including violation of certain environmental or export laws), the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. government contracts pending the
completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages. The U.S. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. The U.S.
government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years. Independently, failure to comply with
U.S. laws and regulations related to the export of goods and technology outside the United States could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of our export privileges.

Our International Operations Subject Us to Economic Risk As Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Foreign Currency Fluctuations and Changes in
Local Government Regulation

We conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 62 percent of our total 2007 segment
revenues derived from operations outside of the United States and from U.S. export sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand in export markets and affect reported profits of our non-U.S. operations (primarily the commercial
businesses) where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. dollars. Given that the majority of our revenues are non-U.S. based, a
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations.



The majority of sales in the aerospace businesses is transacted in U.S. dollars, consistent with
established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the United States is incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the Euro and the Canadian dollar). For differences between U.S. dollar sales and local
currency costs, there is a foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. To manage this exposure, we employ
long-term hedging strategies associated with U.S. dollar revenues. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2007 Annual Report for a discussion of our hedging strategies.

Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those
related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including
government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. For example, as a condition of sale or
award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. The contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to
perform in accordance with the offset requirements. In addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa that carry high levels of currency,
political and economic risk. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.

We Use a Variety of Raw Materials, Supplier-Provided Parts, Components, Sub-Systems and Third Party Contract Manufacturing Services in Our Businesses, and
Significant Shortages, Supplier Capacity Constraints, Supplier Production Disruptions or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products

Our reliance on suppliers, third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in
the manufacturing of our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be
subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions, price
increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management and production practices
are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have
an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

We Engage in Acquisitions, and May Encounter Difficulties Integrating
Acquired Businesses with Our Current Operations; Therefore, We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Acquisitions

We
seek to grow through strategic acquisitions. In the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement and expand our businesses, and may continue to do so in the future. The
success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions, apply our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, and cooperate with our strategic partners. We may
encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we
anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We Design,
Manufacture and Service Products that Incorporate Advanced Technologies; The Introduction of New Products and Technologies Involves Risks and We May Not Realize the Degree or Timing of Benefits Initially Anticipated

We seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. We
regularly invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts that pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these advancements depends on a variety of
factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of internal and supplier-produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers
and subcontractors; achieving cost and production efficiencies, validation of innovative technologies and the level of customer interest in new technologies and products. These factors involve significant

- 9 -


risks and uncertainties. We may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing
of benefits initially anticipated. In particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities Pratt & Whitney or its affiliates will produce aircraft engines currently in development or pending required
certifications. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We Are Subject to Litigation and Legal
Compliance Risks That Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance
risks. These risks include, among other things, litigation concerning product liability matters, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with U.S. and foreign export laws,
competition laws and sales and trading practices. We or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such litigation. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in
certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts. Independently, failure of us or one of our business units to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and
suspension or termination of export privileges. While we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will
continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our results may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required by
generally accepted accounting principles, we estimate material loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances
known to us at a particular point in time. If there is a range of estimates and no amount within that range is more likely to occur than another, then we accrue the minimum amount. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our
assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be
recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid. For a description of current legal proceedings, see Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K.

SM

.

Our fixed assets as of December 31, 2007 include the manufacturing
facilities and non-manufacturing facilities such as warehouses set forth in the tables above and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which are general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs, tools and fixtures and
in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The facilities, warehouses, machinery and equipment in use as of December 31, 2007 are in good operating condition, are well-maintained and substantially all are in
regular use.

Our management believes that the fixed assets capitalized and the facilities in operation at December 31, 2007 for the
production of our products are suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein in the current business environment and have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on
demand for the products. We continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time adjust our facility needs.

For discussion of the effect of our restructuring actions on manufacturing facilities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2007 Annual Report.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

As previously disclosed, the
Department of Justice (DOJ) sued us in 1999 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, claiming that Pratt & Whitney violated the civil False Claims Act and common law. This lawsuit relates to the “Fighter Engine
Competition” between Pratt & Whitney’s F100 engine and General Electric’s F110 engine. The DOJ alleges that the government overpaid for F100 engines under contracts awarded by the U.S. Air Force in fiscal years 1985 through
1990 because Pratt & Whitney inflated its estimated costs for some purchased parts and withheld data that would have revealed the overstatements. Treble damages and penalties of up to $10,000 per false claim could be assessed if the court
finds that Pratt & Whitney violated the civil False Claims Act, and common law damages would accrue pre-judgment interest. Trial of this matter was completed in December 2004. At trial, the government claimed Pratt & Whitney’s
liability is $624 million. We believe that this estimate is substantially overstated, denied any liability and vigorously defended against the DOJ’s claims. A decision is pending. Should the government ultimately prevail, the outcome of this
matter could result in a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which damages would be paid.

As previously disclosed, on February 21, 2007, the European Commission’s Competition Directorate (EU Commission) ruled that Otis’
subsidiaries in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and a portion of the business of Otis’ German subsidiary, violated European Union (EU) competition rules and assessed a €225 million (approximately $300 million) civil fine
against Otis, its relevant local entities, and UTC, which was paid during 2007. In May 2007, we filed an appeal of the decision before the EU’s European Court of First Instance. Resolution of the matter is not expected within the next twelve
months.

As previously disclosed, during the first quarter of 2007, the Austrian Federal Competition Authority (Competition Authority)
filed a complaint with the Cartel Court in Austria (Cartel Court) against Otis’ Austrian subsidiary in connection with an investigation of unlawful collusive arrangements in the Austrian elevator and escalator industry. On December 14,
2007 the Cartel Court, at the request of the Competition Authority, assessed civil fines against the participants in the collusive arrangements, including a fine of €18.2 million (approximately $26 million) against Otis’ Austrian
subsidiary, which fine has been fully provided for at December 31, 2007. We have appealed the Cartel Court ruling.

- 11 -


As previously disclosed, in 2005 the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) conducted an inspection at the
offices of Otis Korea and its three Korean competitors. Based on the results of a subsequent internal investigation conducted by Otis, we believe that certain Otis Korea employees engaged in collusive activities in the Korean market for new
equipment, and that certain employees also engaged in price-fixing in the market for industrial electric motors. In May 2007, the KFTC expanded its investigation to also focus on pricing of subcontracts for elevator installation. Based on its own
investigation, Otis believes certain Otis Korea employees shared subcontractor pricing information with competitors in years prior to 2005. Otis has fully cooperated with the KFTC investigation, disclosed the results of its internal investigations
to the KFTC, and applied for leniency with respect to those disclosures. In September 2007, the KFTC issued its decision regarding the motor cartel and granted Otis Korea 100 percent leniency. Otis expects to receive a complaint regarding the new
equipment sales investigation in the near future. A complaint regarding installation subcontractor pricing may be received sometime in 2008. We do not believe that any fines that may be imposed will have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition or cash flows or on Otis’ competitive position.

As previously disclosed, class action consumer
complaints have been filed against Carrier in Washington, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ontario and British Columbia. The complaints allege Carrier engaged in deceptive and unfair trade practices by knowingly selling high-efficiency condensing
furnaces containing secondary heat exchangers that corrode and fail prematurely, causing residential customers to incur labor costs for repair or replacement that are not covered by Carrier’s warranty. While Carrier denies liability and
disputes the claims, Carrier and counsel for the class action plaintiffs have reached a comprehensive agreement to settle these actions. Under the settlement, Carrier agrees to (1) extend the labor warranty on the heat exchangers for current
owners of affected furnaces, or provide an optional credit toward the purchase of new equipment, (2) reimburse owners who have already paid for repairs to their heat exchanger, and (3) pay the fees and costs incurred by the plaintiffs. The
settlement is subject to approval by the U.S. and Canadian courts, after notice to the potential class members. Carrier anticipates decisions by these courts during 2008. During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a reserve for the
actual and estimated future costs of the settlement.

As previously disclosed, like many other companies in recent years, we or our
subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos integrated into certain of our products or premises. While we have never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporate it in any
currently-manufactured products, certain of our historical products, like those of many other manufacturers, have contained components incorporating asbestos. We have made no payment in a substantial majority of the cases closed to date. The
remainder of the resolved cases have settled for amounts that are not material to us, and have been supported in part by insurance. At December 31, 2007, we were named in approximately 3,100 lawsuits involving approximately 14,400 individual
claimants. A substantial majority of the pending claims are in state courts in Mississippi, Texas and New York.

Except as otherwise noted
above, we do not believe that resolution of any of the legal matters discussed above will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. A further discussion of government
contracts and related investigations, as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities, can be found under the heading “Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole – Compliance with Environmental and Other Government
Regulations” in Item 1, “Business,” and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Form 10-K.

Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Operating Officer, the Vice
President, Accounting and Finance, the Vice President, Finance and the Vice President, Controller, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any
system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, our President and Chief Operating Officer, our Vice President, Accounting and Finance, our Vice President, Finance and our Vice President,
Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the

- 14 -


Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and
forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our President and Chief Operating Officer, our Vice President, Accounting and Finance, our Vice President, Finance, and our Vice President,
Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

Our management concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in our 2007 Annual
Report.

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
