PART
I

ITEM 1.    Business of Coach,
Inc.

OVERVIEW

Coach, Inc. was founded in 1941 and
acquired by Sara Lee Corporation (‘‘Sara
Lee’’) in 1985. In June  2000, Coach was
incorporated in the state of Maryland. In October  2000, Coach
was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and sold approximately
68  million shares of common stock, split adjusted, representing
19.5% of the outstanding shares. In April  2001, Sara Lee
completed a distribution of its remaining ownership in Coach via an
exchange offer, which allowed Sara Lee stockholders to tender Sara Lee
common stock for Coach common stock. When used herein, the terms
‘‘Coach,’’
‘‘Company,’’
‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us’’
and ‘‘our’’ refer to Coach, Inc., including
consolidated subsidiaries.

Coach has grown from a family-run
workshop in a Manhattan loft to the leading American designer and
marketer of premium handbags and accessories. Coach is one of the most
recognized fine accessories brands in the U.S. and in targeted
international markets. We offer luxury lifestyle accessories to a loyal
and rapidly growing customer base and provide consumers with fresh,
relevant and innovative products that are extremely well made, at an
attractive price. Coach’s modern, fashionable handbags and
accessories use a broad range of high quality fabrics and materials. In
response to our customer's demands for both fashion and function,
Coach offers updated styles and multiple product categories which
address an increasing portion of our consumer's accessory
wardrobe. Coach has created a sophisticated, modern and inviting
environment to showcase its product assortment and reinforce a
consistent brand position wherever the consumer may shop. Finally, we
utilize a flexible, cost-effective global sourcing model, in which
independent manufacturers supply our products, allowing Coach to bring
its broad range of products to market rapidly and efficiently.

In order to expand our presence in the Japanese market and to
exercise greater control over our brand in that country, Coach Japan,
Inc. was formed in June  2001 as a joint venture with Sumitomo
Corporation. On July  1,  2005, we purchased
Sumitomo’s 50% interest in Coach Japan, Inc.,
(‘‘Coach Japan’’) resulting in Coach Japan
becoming a 100% owned subsidiary of Coach, Inc.

Coach
offers a number of key differentiating elements that set it apart from
the competitive landscape including:

A Distinctive Brand

– Coach offers distinctive, easily recognizable, accessible
luxury products that are relevant, extremely well-made and provide
excellent value.

A Market Leadership Position with Growing
Share

– Coach is America’s leading premium handbag
and accessories brand and each year, as our market share increases, our
leadership position strengthens.

Coach’s Loyal and
Involved Consumer

– Coach consumers have a specific
emotional connection with the brand. Part of the Company’s
everyday mission is to cultivate consumer relationships by
strengthening this emotional connection.

Multi-Channel
International Distribution

–This allows Coach to maintain a
critical balance as results do not depend solely on the performance of
a single channel or geographic area. The Direct channel provides us
with immediate, controlled access to consumers through Coach-owned
stores in North America and Japan, the Internet and catalogs. The
Indirect channel provides us with access to consumers via U.S. and
international wholesale customers.

Coach is Innovative and
Consumer-Centric

– Coach listens to its consumer through
rigorous consumer research and strong customer orientation. Coach works
to anticipate the consumer’s changing needs by keeping the
product assortment fresh and relevant.

Coach believes that these
differentiating elements have enabled the Company to offer a unique
proposition to the marketplace

.

We hold the number one position
within the U.S. premium handbags and accessories market and the number
two position within the Japanese imported luxury handbags and
accessories market.



Growth Strategies

In order to
continue to expand our market share globally, Coach is pursuing two key
growth strategies: first, increased global distribution, with an
emphasis on our direct retail distribution in North America and Japan,
and second, improving productivity.

Increased Global
Distribution

– The potential for distribution growth is
significant in North America and Japan, as well as in emerging markets.
Our primary focus is the expansion of Coach’s North American
retail store base given the continued double-digit growth of the
premium handbag and accessory category in the U.S. Over the next three
years, we plan to add about 100 North American retail stores, bringing
the store base to over 300 stores. We believe that North America,
including Canada, can, over the next several years, support
approximately 400 stores. In addition, we will continue to expand
select, highly productive retail and factory locations. In Japan, we
are continuing to aggressively expand market share with the consumer,
primarily through distribution, including new stores and expansions,
utilizing a similar multi-channel distribution model that we have
established in the U.S. Based on our analysis, and the regional market
opportunity we have just begun to realize, we estimate that Japan can
support at least 180 Coach locations.

In addition to our two
core markets, the U.S. and Japan, the Asian region represents an
excellent growth opportunity as we partner with local distributors to
grow Coach’s presence in this area. Today, there are over 75
locations in Asia excluding Japan, with the largest markets being Korea
and Taiwan, where the emerging middle class along with the Japanese
tourists, have created very attractive opportunities for us. We are
also focused on Hong Kong as the gateway to greater China. We have
begun to establish a presence in mainland China through two pilot
stores in Beijing and Shanghai, and expect to open at least ten new
locations over the next two to three years on the mainland.

Improving Productivity

– By leveraging our unique
position as an accessible luxury lifestyle brand, we are building share
in the rapidly growing North American women’s accessories market
and in the Japanese accessories market. There are four initiatives we
have undertaken to maximize productivity:

Intensify awareness
as a year-round gift resource.

We are intensifying awareness
as a year-round gift resource by offering a variety of products at a
broader range of prices, providing perfect options for all gift-giving
holidays. We continue to offer a wide assortment of products at
competitive price points, as well as a full range of accessories at
sharp price points, including wristlets, agendas, iPod cases,
sunglasses, cell phone lanyards, and charms.

Develop
under-penetrated categories and emphasize new usage
occasions.

We are expanding our core collections and
developing under-penetrated categories such as business totes, weekend
casual, evening and baby bags. We continue to introduce product for new
usage occasions, such as business totes, weekend casual and evening to
address voids in our offerings. We strive to understand what our
customers want and what they need to suit their lifestyle needs
everyday. We work hard to have product that is both fashionable and
functional, and by doing this we gain an even greater presence in our
customers’ accessory wardrobe and give the Coach shopper
additional reasons to visit and re-purchase.

Tiered
merchandise strategy.

We introduced this strategy into our
stores three years ago, offering more sophisticated product in limited
quantities in our flagship and fashion locations, while maintaining our
core assortment in the greater number of Coach stores. Today, the
balance has shifted as fashion locations represent the majority of our
stores. We have elevated our customers’ expectations regarding
product and found additional opportunities to graduate stores. We are
experiencing significantly higher limited edition penetration, along
with driving units per transaction by offering a broader assortment of
add-on items and potential new categories. We believe that opportunity
still remains to graduate stores from core to fashion, and fashion to
flagship.

Enhance level of service in stores.

At
Coach, we want to be as well-known for excellent service as we are for
great product. Great service builds loyalty and loyalty drives sales.
While we pride ourselves on today’s service levels, we realize
that a programmatic approach, reinforced by training and performance
standards, will enhance the Coach shopping experience. The store
service initiative is two-fold. First, we are expanding our in-store
marketing program, making it easier for our customers



to shop. Coach by Special Request, which we
introduced two years ago, allows our customers to pre-order product or
purchase styles that are not available when they visit a particular
store, all on an automated system, and have them shipped directly to
their home. Second, we are elevating the level of customer service in
our stores. We continue to evolve our Coach service programs, focusing
on additional opportunities to deliver consistent customer service
through new tools and initiatives. This past year, through our smart
scheduling initiative, overall labor hours were invested to deliver
more consistent customer service. The success of this initiative was
demonstrated in our fiscal 2006 results, as we were able to maintain
conversion rates in full price stores on higher traffic, and improve
conversion in the factory stores.

Products

Coach's
primary product offerings include handbags, women’s and
men’s accessories, outerwear, business, travel, watches,
footwear and eyewear.

Handbags

Handbag sales
accounted for approximately 67% of net sales in fiscal 2006.
Coach makes monthly offerings of its handbag collections, featuring
classically inspired designs as well as fashion trend designs.
Typically, there are three to four collections per quarter and four to
seven styles per collection.

Accessories

Women's accessories, consisting of
money pieces, wristlets, cosmetic cases, key fobs, belts, electronic
accessories and all other small leather accessories represented
approximately 23% of Coach's net sales in fiscal 2006. Our
women’s accessories collections are coordinated with our
handbags. Men's accessories, consisting of belts, wallets and
other small leather goods, represented approximately 2% of
Coach's net sales in fiscal 2006.

Outerwear, Gloves,
Hats and Scarves

This category represented approximately
2% of Coach's net sales in fiscal 2006. The assortment is
primarily women's and contains a fashion assortment in all four
components of this category.

Business

Business
cases represented approximately 1% of Coach's net sales in
fiscal 2006. The assortment is primarily men’s and includes
computer bags, messenger-style bags and totes.

Travel

The travel collections are comprised of luggage
and travel accessories. This category represented approximately
1% of Coach's net sales in fiscal 2006.

Watches

Movado Group, Inc.
(‘‘Movado’’) has been Coach's watch
licensee since 1998 and has developed a distinctive collection of
watches inspired primarily by the women's collections with select
men's styles. This category represented approximately 1%
of Coach's net sales in fiscal 2006.

Footwear

Jimlar Corporation
(‘‘Jimlar’’) has been Coach's
footwear licensee since 1999. Footwear is distributed through more than
500 locations in the U.S., including leading Coach retail stores and
U.S. department stores. Approximately 98% of this business is in
women's footwear, which coordinates with Coach’s handbag
collections. This category represented approximately 2% of
Coach's net sales in fiscal 2006.

Eyewear

Marchon Eyewear
(‘‘Marchon’’) has been Coach’s
eyewear licensee since 2003. The eyewear collection is a collaborative
effort from Marchon and Coach that combines the Coach aesthetic for
fashion accessories with the latest fashion directions in eyewear and
sunglasses. Coach sunglasses are sold in Coach retail stores,
department stores, select sunglass retailers and optical retailers in
major markets. The ophthalmic collection is available through
Marchon’s extensive network of optical retailers. This category
represented approximately 1% of Coach's net sales in
fiscal 2006.

Design and Merchandising

Coach's New
York-based design team, led by its Executive Creative Director, is
responsible for conceptualizing and directing the design of all Coach
products. Designers have access to Coach's extensive archives of
product designs created over the past 60 years, which are a valuable
resource for



new product concepts. Coach designers are also
supported by a strong merchandising team that analyzes sales, market
trends and consumer preferences to identify business opportunities that
help guide each season's design process. Merchandisers also
analyze products to edit, add and delete styles to achieve profitable
sales across all channels. Three product category teams, each comprised
of design, merchandising/product development and sourcing specialists,
help Coach execute design concepts that are consistent with the
brand's strategic direction.

Coach's merchandising
team works in close collaboration with our licensing partners to ensure
that the licensed products, watches, footwear and eyewear, are
conceptualized and designed to address the intended market opportunity
and convey the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with
the Coach brand.

Segments

Coach operates in two
reportable segments: Direct-to-Consumer and Indirect. The reportable
segments represent channels of distribution that offer similar
products, service and marketing strategies. See Note 11 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for segment financial
information.

Direct-to-Consumer Segment

The
Direct-to-Consumer segment consists of channels that provide us with
immediate, controlled access to consumers: retail stores and factory
stores in North America and Japan, the Internet and catalogs. This
segment represented approximately 76% of Coach's total net
sales in fiscal 2006, with North American stores and Coach Japan
contributing approximately 54% and 20% of total net
sales, respectively.

North American Retail
Stores

Our stores are sophisticated, modern, and inviting.
They showcase the world of Coach and enhance the shopping experience
while reinforcing the image of the Coach brand. Coach stores are
located in upscale regional shopping centers and metropolitan areas.
Our flagship stores, which offer the broadest assortment of Coach
products, are located in high-visibility locations such as New York,
Chicago and San Francisco. The following table shows the number of
Coach retail stores and their total and average square footage:

The retail
stores carry an assortment of products depending on their size and
location. The modern store design creates a distinctive environment
that showcases these various products. Store associates are trained to
maintain high standards of visual presentation, merchandising and
customer service. The result is a complete statement of the Coach
modern American style at the retail level.

North American
Factory Stores

Coach's factory stores serve as an
efficient means to sell manufactured-for-factory-store product,
including factory exclusives, as well as discontinued and irregular
inventory outside the retail channel. These stores operate under the
Coach Factory name and are geographically positioned primarily in
established centers that are generally more than 50



miles from major markets. The following table
shows the number of Coach factory stores and their total and average
square
footage:

Coach’s
factory store design, visual presentations and customer service levels
support and reinforce the brand's image. Through these factory
stores, Coach targets value-oriented customers who would not otherwise
buy the Coach brand. Prices are generally discounted from 10% to
50% below full retail prices.

Coach Japan,
Inc.

Coach Japan operates department store shop-in-shop
locations as well as freestanding flagship, retail and factory stores.
Flagship stores, which offer the broadest assortment of Coach products,
are located in select shopping districts of Japan. The following table
shows the number of Coach Japan locations and their total and average
square
footage:

Internet

Coach
views its website as a key communications vehicle for the brand to
promote traffic in Coach retail stores and department store locations
and build brand awareness. Our internet business has grown to be
significant, generating net sales of approximately $54  million
in fiscal 2006. The growth in the Internet business is driven by the
strength of the overall Coach brand as well as advertising and email
contacts. In fiscal 2006, there were approximately 40  million
unique visitors to the website. In addition, the Company sent
approximately 55  million emails to strategically selected
customers in fiscal 2006. Like Coach catalogs, the online store
provides a showcase environment where consumers can browse through a
selected offering of the latest styles and colors. Revenue from
internet sales is recognized upon shipment of the product.

Catalog

In fiscal 2006, the Company distributed
approximately 7.6  million catalogs in Coach stores in North
America and Japan and mailed approximately 4.1  million catalogs
to strategically selected U.S. households from its database of
customers. While direct mail sales comprise a small portion of
Coach's net sales, Coach views its catalog as a key
communications vehicle for the brand because it promotes store traffic,
facilitates the shopping experience in Coach retail stores and builds
brand awareness. As an integral component of our communications
strategy, the graphics, models and photography are upscale and modern
and present the product in an environment consistent with the Coach
brand position. The catalogs highlight selected products and serve as a
reference for customers, whether ordering through the catalog, making
in-store purchases or purchasing over the Internet.



Indirect Segment

Coach
began as a U.S. wholesaler to department stores and this segment
remains important to our overall consumer reach. Today, we work closely
with our partners, both domestic and international, to ensure a clear
and consistent product presentation. The indirect channel represented
approximately 24% of total net sales in fiscal 2006, with U.S.
Wholesale and International Wholesale representing approximately
11% and 7% of total net sales,
respectively.

U.S. Wholesale

This channel offers
consumers who prefer shopping at department stores, or who live in
geographic areas that are currently not large enough to support a Coach
retail store, access to Coach products. While overall U.S. department
store sales have been lackluster the last few years, the handbag and
accessory category within this channel has remained strong, in large
part due to the strength of Coach. Therefore, the department stores
continue to devote increased square footage to Coach, providing an
additional driver to this channel’s growth.

Coach
recognizes the continued importance of U.S. department stores as a
distribution channel for premier accessories. We continue to fine-tune
our strategy to increase productivity and drive volume by enhancing
presentation, primarily through the creation of more shop-in-shops, and
the introduction of caseline enhancements with proprietary Coach
fixtures, while exiting lower performing doors and working with the
department stores to re-allocate their Coach spending to higher volume
locations. Coach has also improved the wholesale product planning and
allocation processes and custom tailors assortments to better match the
attributes of our department store consumers in each local market. Net
sales to U.S. wholesale customers grew 23% in fiscal 2006 from
fiscal 2005. Coach's products are sold in approximately 900 U.S.
wholesale locations. Our most significant U.S. wholesale customers are
Federated Department Stores (including Macy's,
Bloomingdale's, Lord and Taylor, Marshall Fields and
Filene’s), Dillard's, Nordstrom and Saks, Inc. (including
Saks Fifth Avenue and Parisian). Store closures resulting from the
recent Federated Department Stores and May Co. merger did not have a
significant impact on Coach’s U.S. wholesale
business.

International Wholesale

This channel
represents sales to international wholesale distributors and authorized
retailers. Within the international arena, the largest portion of sales
is currently the traveling Japanese consumer. However, we continue to
drive growth by expanding our distribution to reach local consumers in
emerging markets. Coach has developed relationships with a select group
of distributors who market Coach products through department stores,
freestanding retail locations and specialty retailers in 18 countries.
Coach's current network of international distributors serves
markets such as Korea, the United States (primarily Hawaii and Guam),
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Mexico,
Thailand, Malaysia, the Caribbean, China, New Zealand and France. For
locations not in freestanding stores, Coach has created shop-in-shops
and other image enhancing environments to increase brand appeal and
stimulate growth. Coach continues to improve productivity in this
channel by opening larger image-enhancing locations, expanding existing
stores and closing smaller, less productive stores. Coach's most
significant international wholesale customers are the DFS Group, Lotte
Group, Shilla Group, Tasa Meng Corp. and Imaginex.

The following
table shows the number of international wholesale locations at which
Coach products are sold:

Business

As part of the indirect channel of distribution,
Coach sells products to corporations and distributors for incentive and
gift-giving programs.



Licensing

In our licensing
relationships, Coach takes an active role in the design process and
controls the marketing and distribution of products under the Coach
brand. The current licensing relationships as of July  1,
2006 are as follows:

Products made under license are, in most
cases, sold through all of the channels discussed above and, with
Coach's approval, these licensees have the right to distribute
Coach brand products selectively through several other channels: shoes
in department store shoe salons, watches in selected jewelry stores and
eyewear in selected optical retailers. These venues provide additional,
yet controlled, exposure of the Coach brand. Coach's licensing
partners pay royalties to Coach on their net sales of Coach branded
products. However, such royalties are not material to the Coach
business as they currently comprise less than 1% of
Coach’s total revenues. The licensing agreements generally give
Coach the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are
not achieved.

Marketing

Coach’s marketing
strategy is to deliver a consistent message each time the consumer
comes in contact with the Coach brand, through our communications and
visual merchandising. The Coach image is created internally and
executed by the creative marketing, visual merchandising and public
relations teams. Coach also has a sophisticated consumer and market
research capability, which helps us assess consumer attitudes and
trends and gauge the likelihood of a product’s success in the
marketplace prior to its introduction.

In conjunction with
promoting a consistent global image, Coach uses its extensive customer
database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and
communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales
across all distribution channels.

Coach engages in several
consumer communication initiatives, including direct marketing
activities and national, regional and local advertising. In fiscal
2006, consumer contacts increased 16% to over 100
million. However, the Company continues to leverage marketing expenses.
Total expenses related to consumer communications in fiscal 2006 were
$36  million, representing less than 2% of net sales.

Coach’s wide range of direct marketing activities includes
catalogs, brochures and email contacts, targeted to promote sales to
consumers in their preferred shopping venue. In addition to building
brand awareness, Coach catalogs and www.coach.com serve as effective
brand communications vehicles by providing a showcase environment where
consumers can browse through a strategic offering of the latest styles
and colors, which drives store traffic.

As part of Coach's
direct marketing strategy, it uses its database consisting of
approximately 9.7  million active U.S. households. Catalogs and
email contacts are Coach's principal means of communication and
are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases and
build brand awareness. The rapidly growing number of visitors to the
www.coach.com online store provides an opportunity to increase the size
of this database.

The Company also runs national, regional and
local advertising campaigns, primarily print and outdoor advertising,
in support of its major selling seasons.

Manufacturing

All of our products are manufactured by
independent manufacturers. However, we maintain control of the supply
chain from design through manufacture. We are able to do this by
qualifying all raw material suppliers and by maintaining sourcing
offices in Hong Kong, China and South Korea that work closely with our
independent manufacturers. Coach also operates a European sourcing and



product development organization based in
Florence, Italy that works closely with the New York design team. This
broad-based, multi-country manufacturing strategy is designed to
optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction capabilities. We
have increased the presence of our senior management at the
manufacturers’ facilities to enhance control over decision
making and ensure the speed with which we bring new product to market
is maximized.

These independent manufacturers can support a
broader mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new,
more fashion oriented styles, which allows us to meet shifts in
marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. During fiscal
year 2006, approximately 70% of Coach's total net sales
were generated from products introduced within the fiscal year. At the
same time, by designating a significant number of the new styles as
‘‘limited editions’’ that are planned to be
offered for a brief time and then replaced with fresh new products, we
help manage total inventory and limit our exposure to excess and
obsolete inventory.

All product sources, including independent
manufacturers and licensing partners, must achieve and maintain
Coach's high quality standards, which are an integral part of the
Coach identity. One of Coach's keys to success lies in the
rigorous selection of raw materials. Coach has longstanding
relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware. As Coach
has moved its production to external sources, it has maintained control
of the raw materials that are used in all of its products, wherever
they are made. Compliance with quality control standards is monitored
through on-site quality inspections at all independent manufacturing
facilities.

Coach carefully balances its commitments to a
limited number of ‘‘better brand’’ partners
with demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. Our
manufacturers are located in many countries, including China, Hungary,
India, Italy, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand
and Turkey. No one vendor provides more than 15% of
Coach’s total units. Before partnering with a vendor, Coach
evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice
standards audit. Periodic evaluations of existing, previously approved
facilities are conducted on a random basis. We believe that all of our
manufacturing partners are in compliance with Coach’s integrity
standards.

Distribution

Coach operates a distribution,
consumer service and repair facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This
automated, 560,000 square foot facility uses a bar code scanning
warehouse management system. Coach's distribution center
employees use handheld radio frequency scanners to read product bar
codes, which allow them to more accurately process and pack orders,
track shipments, manage inventory and generally provide better service
to our customers. Coach's products are primarily shipped to Coach
retail stores and wholesale customers via Federal Express and common
carrier, and direct to consumers via Federal Express.

During
2006, the Jacksonville facility was redesigned, without increasing the
building’s square footage, to increase storage and processing
capacity. This redesign will enable us to maximize the storage capacity
of the building and also increase processing capability and output per
associate. We expect that the facility’s increased capacity can
support the projected sales growth of the Company during the next few
years.

Management Information Systems

The
foundation of Coach's information systems is its Enterprise
Resource Planning system. This fully integrated system supports all
aspects of finance and accounting, procurement, inventory control,
sales and store replenishment. The system functions as a central
repository for all of Coach's transactional information,
resulting in increased efficiencies, improved inventory control and a
better understanding of consumer demand. This system is fully scalable
to accommodate rapid growth.

Complementing its Enterprise
Resource Planning system are several other system solutions, each of
which Coach believes is well suited for its needs. The data warehouse
system summarizes the transaction information and provides a single
platform for all management reporting. The supply chain management
system supports corporate sales and inventory functions, creating a
monthly demand plan



and reconciling production/procurement with
financial plans. Product fulfillment is facilitated by Coach's
highly automated warehouse management system and electronic data
interchange system, while the unique requirements of Coach's
Internet and catalog businesses are supported by Coach’s order
management system. Finally, the point-of-sale system supports all
in-store transactions, distributes management reporting to each store,
and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis. This daily
collection of store sales and inventory information results in early
identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for
store inventory replenishment. Updates and upgrades of these systems
are made on a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly
improve our functionality. All complementary systems are integrated
with the central Enterprise Resource Planning system.

Trademarks and Patents

Coach owns all of the material
trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing and
distribution of all of its products, both in the U.S. and in other
countries in which the products are principally sold. Coach also owns
and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in all relevant
classes of products in each of the countries in which Coach products
are sold. Major trademarks include

Coach, Coach and lozenge
design

and

Coach and tag design

and it has applications
pending for a proprietary

‘‘C’’ signature
fabric design

. Coach is not dependent on any one particular
trademark or design patent although Coach believes that the Coach name
is important for its business. In addition, several of Coach's
products are covered by design patents or patent applications. Coach
aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues
infringers both domestically and internationally. It also pursues
counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated
internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the Coach
hotline and business partners around the world.

Coach's
trademarks in the United States will remain in existence for as long as
Coach continues to use and renew them on their expiration date. Coach
has no material patents.

Employees

As of
July  1,  2006, Coach employed approximately 7,500 people,
including both full and part time employees. Of these employees,
approximately 2,300 and 3,500 were full time and part time employees,
respectively, in the retail field in North America and Japan. In
addition, approximately 50 of Coach’s employees are covered by
collective bargaining agreements. Coach believes that its relations
with its employees are good, and it has never encountered a strike or
work stoppage.

Government Regulation

Most of
Coach's imported products are subject to existing or potential
duties, tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of products that
Coach may import into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the
cost of such products. Coach has not been restricted by quotas in the
operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised a
material portion of the total cost of its products. In addition, Coach
is subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions,
including U.S. retaliation against certain prohibited foreign
practices, with respect to its product sourcing and international sales
operations.

ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors

You should consider carefully all of the information set forth or
incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the
following risk factors associated with the Business of Coach and
forward-looking information in this document. Please also see
‘‘Special Note on Forward-Looking
Information’’ at the beginning of this report. The risks
described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not
presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also
have an adverse effect on us. If any of the risks below actually occur,
our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition
could suffer.

The growth of our business depends on the
successful execution of our growth strategies.

Our growth
depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the
successful design and introduction of new products. Our ability to
create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by
whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer
preferences and fashion trends. The failure to develop and launch
successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. Also,
any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in
our not being the first to market, which could compromise our
competitive position.

Significant competition in our
industry could adversely affect our business.

We face
intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we
operate. Our competitors include private label retailers, including
some of Coach’s wholesale customers, as well as other well known
handbags and accessories companies. There is a risk that our
competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our
customers. We may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such
product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business.
Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands,
whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to
protect our trademarks and design patents. A failure to compete
effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability.

We face risks associated with operating in international
markets.

We operate on a global basis, with approximately
25% of our net sales coming from operations outside the U.S.
However, sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated
in U.S. dollars. While geographic diversity helps to reduce the
Company’s exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject
to risks associated with international operations, including, but not
limited to:

•

changes in exchange rates
for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of
our products and result in decreased international consumer demand or
increase our supply costs in those markets,

•

political or economic instability or
changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, and

•

changes in foreign or domestic legal and
regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more
onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other
government controls.

We monitor our foreign currency exposure in
Japan to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate
movements through foreign currency hedging of Coach Japan’s U.S.
dollar denominated inventory purchases. We cannot ensure, however, that
these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign
currency rate movements.

A downturn in the economy could
affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our
business.

Many factors affect the level of consumer
spending in the premium handbag and accessories market, including,
among others, general business conditions, interest rates, the
availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in
future economic conditions. Consumer



purchases of discretionary luxury items,
such as Coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods,
when disposable income is lower. A downturn in the economies in which
Coach sells its products may adversely affect Coach’s
sales.

Our business is subject to the risks inherent in
global sourcing activities.

As a company engaged in
sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in
such activities, including, but not limited to:

•

availability of raw materials,

•

compliance with labor laws and other
foreign governmental regulations,

•

disruptions or delays in shipments,

•

loss or impairment of key manufacturing
sites,

•

product quality issues,

•

political
unrest,

•

as well as natural disasters,
acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have
no control.

While we have business continuity and contingency
plans for our sourcing sites, significant disruption of manufacturing
for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not
remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our
business.

Our business is subject to increased costs due to
excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our
products.

If Coach misjudges the market for its products it
may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and
missed opportunities for other products. In addition, because Coach
places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives
wholesale customers’ orders, it could experience higher excess
inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than
anticipated.

Our operating results are subject to seasonal
and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market
price of Coach common stock.

Because Coach products are
frequently given as gifts, Coach has historically realized, and expects
to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second
quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of
November and December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating
income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal
wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. However,
over the past several years, we have achieved higher levels of growth
in the non holiday quarters, which has reduced these seasonal
fluctuations. We expect that these trends will continue.

Provisions in Coach’s charter and bylaws, Maryland
law or its ‘‘poison pill’’ may delay or
prevent an acquisition of Coach by a third party.

Coach’s charter and bylaws and Maryland law contain
provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire Coach
without the consent of Coach’s Board of Directors.
Coach’s charter permits its Board of Directors, without
stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the
aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of
any class or series that Coach has the authority to issue. In addition,
Coach’s Board of Directors may classify or reclassify any
unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the
preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified
shares. Although Coach’s Board of Directors has no intention to
do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred
stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price
for Coach’s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of
Coach’s stockholders.

On May  3,  2001 Coach
declared a ‘‘poison pill’’ dividend
distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of
each outstanding share of Coach’s common stock. Subject to
limited



exceptions, these rights may be exercised if
a person or group intentionally acquires 10% or more of
Coach’s common stock or announces a tender offer for 10%
or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the Coach Board of
Directors. In this event, each right would entitle the holder of each
share of Coach’s common stock to buy one additional common share
of Coach stock at an exercise price far below the then-current market
price. Subject to certain exceptions, Coach’s Board of Directors
will be entitled to redeem the rights at $0.0001 per right at any time
before the close of business on the tenth day following either the
public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of
Coach’s Board of Directors becomes aware that, a person has
acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. As of the
end of fiscal 2006, there were no shareholders whose common stock
holdings exceeded the 10% threshold established by the rights
plan.

Coach’s bylaws can only be amended by
Coach’s Board of Directors. Coach’s bylaws also provide
that nominations of persons for election to Coach’s Board of
Directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a
stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by
Coach’s Board of Directors or by a stockholder who is entitled
to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice
procedures of Coach’s bylaws. Also, under Maryland law, business
combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between Coach
and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of
Coach’s common stock or an affiliate of such person are
prohibited for a five-year period unless exempted in accordance with
the statute. After this period, a combination of this type must be
approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some
conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by
Coach’s Board of Directors. Coach’s Board has exempted
any business combination with us or any of our affiliates from the
five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote
requirements.

Properties

The following table sets
forth the location, use and size of Coach's distribution,
corporate and product development facilities as of July
1,  2006, substantially all of which are leased. The leases
expire at various times through 2020, subject to renewal options.

As of July  1,  2006, Coach
also occupies 218 retail and 86 factory leased stores located in North
America and 118 department store shop-in-shops, retail and factory
store locations in Japan. Coach considers these properties to be in
generally good condition and believes that its facilities are adequate
for its operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet its
anticipated requirements.



ITEM
3.

Legal Proceedings

Coach is
involved in various routine legal proceedings as both plaintiff and
defendant incident to the ordinary course of its business, including
proceedings to protect Coach’s intellectual property rights,
litigation instituted by persons alleged to have been injured upon
premises within Coach’s control and litigation with present or
former employees.

Although Coach’s litigation
with present or former employees is routine and incidental to the
conduct of Coach’s business, as well as for any business
employing significant numbers of U.S.-based employees, such litigation
can result in large monetary awards when a civil jury is allowed to
determine compensatory and/or punitive damages for actions claiming
discrimination on the basis of age, gender, race, religion, disability
or other legally protected characteristic or for termination of
employment that is wrongful or in violation of implied contracts. As
part of its policing program for its intellectual property rights, from
time to time, Coach files lawsuits in the U.S. and abroad alleging acts
of trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, patent
infringement, trade dress infringement, trademark dilution and/or state
or foreign law claims. At any given point in time, Coach may have one
or more of such actions pending. These actions often result in seizure
of counterfeit merchandise and/or out of court settlements with
defendants. From time to time, defendants will raise, either as
affirmative defenses or as counterclaims, the invalidity or
unenforceability of certain of Coach’s intellectual
properties.

Coach believes that the outcome of all pending legal
proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on
Coach’s business or consolidated financial statements.

Coach has not entered into any transactions that have been
identified by the IRS as abusive or that have a significant tax
avoidance purpose. Accordingly, we have not been required to pay a
penalty to the IRS for failing to make disclosures required with
respect to certain transactions that have been identified by the IRS as
abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose.

Executive Overview

U.S. and Asia. As Coach’s business model is based on
multi-channel international distribution, our success does not depend
solely on the performance of a single channel or geographic
area.

Coach seeks to deliver excellent business results and
superior shareholder returns. In fiscal 2006, an increase in sales,
combined with an improvement in margins, continued to drive net income
and earnings per share growth. The highlights of fiscal 2006
were:

•

Net income rose 37.8% to
$494.3  million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared with
$358.6  million or $0.92 per share in the year ago period.

•

Net sales totaled $2.1  billion,
reflecting a 23.4% increase over prior year sales of $1.7
billion.

•

Direct-to-consumer sales,
which consist primarily of sales at Coach stores in the U.S. and Japan,
rose 23.2% to $1.6  billion during fiscal
2006.

•

Comparable store sales in the U.S.
rose 20.7%, with retail stores up 12.3% and factory
stores up 31.9%.

•

Japan sales,
when translated into U.S. dollars, rose 12.1% driven by new
stores, expansions and mid-single-digit retail comparable store sales.
These increases in sales were offset by a 9.5% decrease due to
currency translation.

During fiscal 2006, we opened 25 new
retail stores and seven new factory stores and closed three factory
stores in the U.S., bringing the total number of retail and factory
stores in the U.S. to 218 and 86, respectively, at the end of fiscal
2006. We also expanded seven retail stores in the U.S. In Japan, we
opened 18 new locations, closed three locations and expanded nine
locations, bringing the total number of locations at the end of fiscal
2006 to 118. Through our international distributors, we opened 14 net
new locations and expanded 14 locations in fiscal 2006, bringing the
total number of international locations, excluding Coach operated
stores in Japan, to 108 at the end of fiscal 2006.



Fiscal 2006 vs. Fiscal

Results of operations for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal
2005 are as follows:

Operating
Income

Operating income increased 33.5% to
$764.6  million in 2006 as compared to $572.6  million in
2005. This increase was driven by increases in net sales and gross
profit, offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses.

The following chart illustrates our operating margin
performance over the last two
years:

The
increase in operating margin is attributable to higher sales and gross
profit as well as the leveraging of selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Net Sales

In fiscal 2006, net sales
increased 23.4% to $2.1  billion compared to $1.7
billion, in fiscal 2005. The net sales increase was driven by growth
across all distribution channels. As a result of Coach’s
acquisition of Sumitomo’s 50% interest in Coach Japan on
July  1,  2005, the Company reevaluated the composition of
its reportable segments and determined that Coach Japan should be a
component of the Direct-to-Consumer segment. Previously, Coach Japan
was included in the Indirect segment. All prior period information has
been reclassified to include Coach Japan as a component of the
Direct-to-Consumer segment.



Net sales by operating segment in fiscal
2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 are as
follows:

Direct

Net
sales increased 23.2% to $1.6  billion during fiscal 2006
from $1.3  billion during fiscal 2005, driven by increased sales
from comparable stores, new stores and expanded stores. Coach excludes
new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of
operation. Similarly, stores that are expanded by 15% or more
are also excluded from the comparable store base until the first
anniversary of their reopening. Stores that are closed for renovations
are removed from the comparable store base.

In North America,
comparable store sales growth, sales from new stores and sales from
expanded stores accounted for approximately $167  million,
$72  million and $13  million, respectively, of the net
sales increase. In Japan, sales from new stores, comparable store sales
growth and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately
$41  million, $32  million and $11  million,
respectively, of the net sales increase. Coach Japan’s reported
net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $35  million
as a result of foreign currency exchange. Sales growth in the Internet
business accounted for the remaining sales increase. These sales
increases were slightly offset by store closures and a slight decline
in the direct marketing channel.

Indirect

Net
sales increased 24.3% to $500.8  million in fiscal 2006
from $403.0  million during fiscal 2005. This increase was driven
by growth in the U.S. wholesale, international wholesale and
business-to-business divisions, which contributed increased sales of
approximately $45  million, $36  million and $18
million, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Licensing revenue
of approximately $9  million and $6  million in fiscal 2006
and fiscal 2005, respectively, is included in indirect sales.

Gross Profit

Gross profit increased 25.0% to
$1.6  billion in fiscal 2006 as compared to $1.3  billion
in fiscal 2005. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 77.6%
in fiscal 2006 from 76.6% in fiscal 2005, as gains from supply
chain initiatives and product mix shifts, reflecting increased
penetration of higher margin collections, more than offset the impact
of channel mix. Coach’s gross profit is dependent upon a variety
of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among
distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, foreign
currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These
factors, among others, may cause gross profit to fluctuate from year to
year.

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses
comprise four categories: selling; advertising, marketing and design;
distribution and customer service; and administrative. Selling expenses
include store employee compensation, store occupancy costs, store
supply costs, wholesale account administration compensation and all
Coach Japan operating expenses. These expenses are affected by the
number of Coach and Coach Japan operated stores open during any fiscal
period and the related proportion of retail and wholesale sales.
Advertising, marketing and design expenses include employee
compensation, media space and production, advertising agency fees, new
product design costs, public relations, market research expenses and
mail order costs. Distribution and customer service expenses include
warehousing, order fulfillment, shipping and handling, customer service
and bag repair costs. Administrative expenses include compensation
costs for the executive, finance, human resources, legal and
information systems departments, as well as consulting and software
expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increase as
Coach and Coach Japan operate more stores, although an



increase in the number of stores generally
results in the fixed portion of selling, general and administrative
expenses being spread over a larger sales base.

Selling, general
and administrative expenses increased 18.4% to $874.3
million in fiscal 2006 from $738.2  million in fiscal 2005,
driven primarily by selling expenses. During fiscal 2006, selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales
improved to 41.4% as compared to 43.2% during fiscal
2005. This improvement was due to leveraging our expense base on higher
sales.

Selling expenses increased 17.0% to $581.9
million, or 27.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2006 from
$497.3  million, or 29.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2005.
The dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to an increase
in operating expenses of North America stores and Coach Japan. The
increase in North America store expenses is attributable to increased
variable expenses related to higher sales, new stores opened during the
fiscal year and the incremental expense associated with having a full
year of expenses related to stores opened in the prior year. The
increase in Coach Japan operating expenses was primarily driven by
increased variable expenses related to higher sales and new store
operating expenses. In addition, the impact of foreign currency
exchange rates decreased reported expenses by approximately $16
million. The remaining increase in selling expenses was due to
increased variable expenses to support sales growth in other
channels.

Advertising, marketing, and design costs increased by
27.7% to $100.6  million, or 4.8% of net sales, in
fiscal 2006 from $78.8  million, or 4.6% of net sales, in
fiscal 2005. This dollar increase was primarily due to increased
staffing costs and increased design expenditures as well as increased
development costs for new product categories.

Distribution and
customer service expenses increased to $43.0  million in fiscal
2006 from $36.9  million in fiscal 2005. The dollar increase in
these expenses was primarily due to higher sales volumes. However,
efficiency gains at the distribution and customer service facility
resulted in an improvement in the ratio of these expenses to net sales
from 2.2% in fiscal 2005 to 2.0% in fiscal
2006.

Administrative expenses increased 18.8% to
$148.8  million, or 7.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2006 from
$125.2  million, or 7.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. The
dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased
share-based compensation costs and other employee staffing costs.
Included as a reduction to administrative expenses are business
interruption proceeds of $2.0  million, related to our World
Trade Center location.

Interest Income, Net

Net
interest income was $32.6  million in fiscal 2006 as compared to
$15.8  million in fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to
higher returns on investments as a result of higher interest rates.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate
increased to 38.0% as compared to the 36.7% rate recorded
in fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to the
non-recurrence of a one time benefit that the Company recorded in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, related to the Company’s buyout
of Sumitomo’s 50% interest in Coach Japan.

Minority Interest

Minority interest expense, net of
tax, was $0 in fiscal 2006 compared to $13.6  million, or
0.8% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. The purchase of
Sumitomo’s 50% interest in Coach Japan on July
1,  2005 eliminated minority interest as of the first quarter of
fiscal 2006.

Net Income

Net income was
$494.3  million in fiscal 2006 as compared to $358.6
million in fiscal 2005. This 37.8% increase is attributable to
increased net sales as well as significant margin improvement, as
discussed above.



Fiscal 2005 vs. Fiscal

Results of operations for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal
2004 are as follows:

(1)

Fiscal
year ended July  3,  2004 was a 53 week
year.

Operating Income

Operating income
increased 41.3% to $572.6  million in 2005 as compared to
$405.3  million in 2004. This increase was driven by increases in
net sales and gross profit, offset by an increase in selling, general
and administrative expenses.

The following chart illustrates our
operating margin performance in fiscal 2005 and
2004:

The
increase in operating margin is attributable to higher sales and gross
profit as well as the leveraging of selling, general and administrative
expenses.

Net Sales

Net sales by operating
segment in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 are as
follows:



Direct

Net sales increased
30.4% to $1.3  billion during fiscal 2005 from $1.0
billion during fiscal 2004, driven by increased sales from comparable
stores, new stores and expanded stores. In North America, comparable
store sales growth, sales from new stores and sales from expanded
stores accounted for approximately $112  million, $85
million and $11  million, respectively, of the net sales
increase. In Japan, sales from new stores, comparable store sales
growth and sales from expanded stores accounted for approximately
$40  million, $30  million and $20  million,
respectively, of the net sales increase. Coach Japan’s reported
net sales were positively impacted by approximately $13  million
as a result of foreign currency exchange. Sales growth in the Internet
business accounted for the remaining sales increase. These sales
increases were offset by $15.7  million of sales in the
additional week of fiscal 2004 as well as store closures and a decline
in the direct marketing channel.

Indirect

Net
sales increased 26.6% to $403.0  million in fiscal 2005
from $318.4  million during fiscal 2004. This increase was driven
by growth in the U.S. wholesale, international wholesale and
business-to-business divisions, which contributed increased sales of
approximately $48  million, $19  million and $10
million, respectively, as compared to the prior year. The remaining net
sales increase is attributable to increases in other indirect channels.
The net sales increase was slightly offset by $3.8  million of
sales from other indirect channels during the additional week of fiscal
2004. Licensing revenue of approximately $6  million and
$5  million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively, is
included in indirect sales.

Gross Profit

Gross
profit increased 32.4% to $1.3  billion in fiscal 2005
from $990.1  million in fiscal 2004. Gross margin increased 170
basis points to 76.6% in fiscal 2005 from 74.9% in fiscal
2004. This improvement was driven by a shift in channel mix, as our
higher gross margin channels grew faster than the business as a whole,
a shift in product mix, reflecting increased penetration of higher
margin mixed material product and accessories, and the continuing
impact of sourcing cost initiatives.

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased 26.2% to $738.2  million in fiscal 2005
from $584.8  million in fiscal 2004. The dollar increase was
caused primarily by increased store operating expenses attributable to
new stores opened both domestically and in Japan and increased variable
expenses to support increased net sales. As a percentage of net sales,
selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2005 were
43.2% compared to 44.3% during fiscal 2004. This
improvement was due to leveraging our expense base on higher
sales.

Selling expenses increased 28.8% to $497.3
million, or 29.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2005 from
$386.2  million, or 29.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2004.
The dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to an increase
in operating expenses associated with Coach Japan and operating
expenses associated with North American stores that were opened during
and after the end of fiscal 2004. The increase in Coach Japan expenses
was driven by new store operating expenses, investment in corporate
infrastructure, increased variable expenses related to higher sales and
increased advertising expense to support the brand in Japan. In
addition, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased
reported expenses by approximately $6.0  million. In North
America, the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by
expenses from new stores, as well as the non-comparable portion of
expenses from stores opened in fiscal 2004. The remaining increase in
selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to support
sales growth.

Advertising, marketing, and design costs increased
by 24.1% to $78.8  million, or 4.6% of net sales,
in fiscal 2005 from $63.5  million, or 4.8% of net sales,
in fiscal 2004. This dollar increase was primarily due to increased
staffing costs and increased design expenditures.

Distribution
and customer service expenses increased to $36.9  million in
fiscal 2005 from $32.4  million in fiscal 2004. The dollar
increase in these expenses was primarily due to higher sales volumes.
However, efficiency gains at the distribution and customer service
facility resulted in an improvement in the ratio of these expenses to
net sales from 2.5% in fiscal 2004 to 2.2% in fiscal
2005.



Administrative expenses increased
21.9% to $125.2  million, or 7.3% of net sales, in
fiscal 2005 from $102.7  million, or 7.8% of net sales, in
fiscal 2004. The dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to
increased compensation costs, including share-based compensation, as
well as increased professional and consulting fees. Included as a
reduction to administrative expenses are business interruption proceeds
of $2.6  million, related to our World Trade Center location.

Interest Income, Net

Net interest income was
$15.8  million in fiscal 2005, as compared to $3.2  million
in fiscal 2004. This dollar change was due to increased positive cash
balances during fiscal 2005 as well as higher returns on investments as
a result of higher interest rates.

Provision for Income
Taxes

The effective tax rate decreased to 36.7% in
fiscal 2005 compared with the 37.3% recorded in fiscal
2004. As a result of the buyout of our joint venture partner in
Coach Japan and a continued need to grow the Coach Japan business, we
determined that the earnings of Coach Japan will be permanently
reinvested and the tax provision previously recorded relating to the
repatriation of those earnings was reversed. The reversal was
recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and brought the full year
to the lower effective annual rate.

Minority
Interest

Minority interest expense, net of tax, decreased
to $13.6  million, or 0.8% of net sales, in fiscal 2005
from $18.0  million, or 1.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2004.
The decrease was primarily due to transfer price increases to Coach
Japan, increased marketing expenses and additional infrastructure
investments.

Net Income

Net income was
$358.6  million in fiscal 2005 as compared to $237.9
million in fiscal 2004. This 50.7% increase is attributable to
increased net sales as well as significant margin improvement, as
discussed above.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities
was $596.6  million in fiscal 2006 compared to $475.6
million in fiscal 2005. The $121.0  million increase was
primarily due to increased earnings of $135.7  million. The
increase in earnings was offset by a $13.6  million decrease in
minority interest expense, as a result of Coach’s acquisition on
July  1,  2005 of Sumitomo’s 50% interest in
Coach Japan. The remaining changes in assets and liabilities are
attributable to normal operating fluctuations.

Net cash used in
investing activities was $181.0  million in fiscal 2006 compared
to $371.8  million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in net cash used
in investing activities is primarily attributable to the non-recurrence
of the $228.4  million buyout of Sumitomo’s 50%
interest in Coach Japan. This decrease was offset by a $39.3
million increase in capital expenditures, primarily related to
investments in corporate systems and infrastructure.

Net cash
used in financing activities was $426.8  million in fiscal 2006
compared to $211.9  million in fiscal 2005. The $214.9
million increase in cash used is primarily attributable to
$335.3  million of additional funds expended to repurchase common
stock. This cash outflow was offset by the non-recurrence of
$72.9  million distributed in the prior year as a result of the
buyout of Coach Japan as well as an increase of $39.7  million in
proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and a $30.7
million increase in the excess tax benefit realized related to these
exercises. In addition, net borrowings on the Coach Japan revolving
credit facility decreased $22.9  million.



On October  16,  2003, Coach,
certain lenders and Bank of America, N.A. (‘‘Bank of
America’’), as primary lender and administrative agent,
renewed the $100  million senior unsecured revolving credit
facility (the ‘‘Bank of America
facility’’), extending the facility expiration to
October  16,  2006. On June  23,  2005, this
facility was extended for one additional year, to October
16,  2007. At Coach’s request, the Bank of America
facility can be expanded to $125  million. This facility is
available for seasonal working capital requirements or general
corporate purposes and may be prepaid without penalty or premium.

During fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 there were no borrowings under
the Bank of America facility. Accordingly, as of July  1,
2006 and July  2,  2005, there were no outstanding
borrowings under the Bank of America facility.

Coach pays a
commitment fee of 10 to 25 basis points on any unused amounts of the
Bank of America facility and interest of LIBOR plus 45 to 100 basis
points on any outstanding borrowings. The initial commitment fee was 15
basis points and the initial LIBOR margin was 62.5 basis points. At
July  1,  2006, the commitment fee was 10 basis points and
the LIBOR margin was 45 basis points, reflecting an improvement in our
fixed-charge coverage ratio.

The Bank of America facility
contains various covenants and customary events of default. Coach has
been in compliance with all covenants since its inception.

To
provide funding for working capital and general corporate purposes,
Coach Japan entered into credit facilities with several Japanese
financial institutions. These facilities allow a maximum borrowing of
7.6  billion yen, or approximately $66.0  million, at
July  1,  2006. Interest is based on the Tokyo Interbank
rate plus a margin of up to 50 basis points.

These facilities
contain various covenants and customary events of default. Coach Japan
has been in compliance with all covenants since their inception. These
facilities include automatic renewals based on compliance with the
covenants. Coach, Inc. is not a guarantor on any of these
facilities.

During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the peak borrowings
under the Japanese credit facilities were $21.6  million and
$50.5  million, respectively. As of July  1,  2006
and July  2,  2005, outstanding borrowings under the
Japanese credit facilities were $0 and $12.3  million,
respectively.

In connection with the stock repurchase program,
purchases of Coach stock may be made from time to time, subject to
market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market
purchases. Repurchased shares of common stock will become authorized
but unissued shares and may be issued in the future for general
corporate and other purposes. On May  11,  2005, the Coach
Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program to
acquire up to $250  million of Coach’s outstanding common
stock. The Company completed this authorization during 2006. On
May  9,  2006, the Coach Board of Directors approved an
additional common stock repurchase program to acquire up to $500
million of Coach’s outstanding common stock. This authorization
expires in June  2007. The Company may terminate or limit the
stock repurchase program at any time.

During fiscal 2006 and
2005, the Company repurchased and retired 19.1  million and
11.0  million shares of common stock at an average cost of $31.50
and $24.09 per share, respectively. As of July  1,  2006,
Coach had approximately $150  million remaining in the stock
repurchase program.

In fiscal 2006, total capital expenditures
were $133.9  million. In North America, Coach opened 25 new
retail and seven new factory stores and expanded seven retail stores
and five factory stores. These new and expanded stores accounted for
approximately $56  million of the total capital expenditures. In
addition, spending on department store renovations and distributor
locations accounted for approximately $6  million of the total
capital expenditures. In Japan, we invested approximately $14
million, primarily for the opening of 18 new locations and nine store
expansions. The remaining capital expenditures related to corporate
systems and infrastructure. These investments were financed from on
hand cash, operating cash flows and by using funds from our Japanese
revolving credit facilities.

For the fiscal year ending
June  30,  2007, the Company expects total capital
expenditures to be approximately $150  million. Capital
expenditures will be primarily for new stores and expansions both



in the U.S. and in Japan. We expect to open
at least 35 new U.S. retail and factory stores and at least 15 net new
locations in Japan, while continuing to invest in department store and
distributor locations. These investments will be financed primarily
from on hand cash and operating cash flows.

Coach experiences
significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements.
During the first fiscal quarter Coach builds inventory for the holiday
selling season, opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of
trade receivables. In the second fiscal quarter its working capital
requirements are reduced substantially as Coach generates consumer
sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable. In fiscal 2006, Coach
purchased approximately $519  million of inventory, which was
funded by on hand cash, operating cash flow and by borrowings under the
Japanese revolving credit facilities.

Management believes that
cash flow from operations and on hand cash will provide adequate funds
for the foreseeable working capital needs, planned capital expenditures
and the common stock repurchase program. Any future acquisitions, joint
ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital.
There can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to
Coach on acceptable terms or at all. Coach’s ability to fund its
working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt
payments, as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants
under its debt agreements, depends on its future operating performance
and cash flow, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic
conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which
are beyond Coach’s control.

Prior to Coach’s spin
off from the Sara Lee Corporation (‘‘Sara
Lee’’), Sara Lee was a guarantor or a party to many of
Coach’s leases. Coach has agreed to make efforts to remove Sara
Lee from all of its existing leases, and Sara Lee is not a guarantor or
a party to any new or renewed leases. Coach has obtained a letter of
credit for the benefit of Sara Lee in an amount approximately equal to
the annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to Coach by
Sara Lee, but for which Sara Lee retains contingent liability. Coach is
required to maintain this letter of credit until the annual minimum
rental payments under the relevant leases are less than $2.0
million. The initial letter of credit had a face amount of $20.6
million, and we expect this amount to decrease annually as
Coach’s guaranteed obligations are reduced. As of July
1,  2006, the letter of credit was $15.1  million. We
expect that we will be required to maintain the letter of credit for
approximately 10 years.

As of July  1,  2006, the
scheduled maturities of Coach’s long-term contractual
obligations are as follows:

Coach
does not have any off-balance-sheet financing or unconsolidated special
purpose entities. Coach’s risk management policies prohibit the
use of derivatives for trading purposes. The valuation of financial
instruments that are marked to market are based upon independent
third-party sources.

Long-Term Debt

Coach is
party to an Industrial Revenue Bond related to its Jacksonville,
Florida distribution and consumer service facility. This loan has a
remaining balance of $3.3  million and bears interest at
4.5%. Principal and interest payments are made semiannually,
with the final payment due in 2014.

Seasonality

Because its products are frequently
given as gifts, Coach has historically realized, and expects to
continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second
quarter of its fiscal year, which



includes the holiday months of November and
December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in
any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale
shipments and other events affecting retail sales. However, over the
past several years, we have achieved higher levels of growth in the
non-holiday quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations. We
expect these trends to continue.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise
activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may
vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial
statements. The accounting policies discussed below are considered
critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent
in these policies could affect the financial statements.

The
areas of accounting that involve significant judgments and estimates
are inventories, share-based compensation, impairment of long lived
assets, goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and revenue
recognition. In certain instances, accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America allow for the selection of
alternative accounting methods. The Company’s significant policy
that involves the selection of an alternative method is accounting for
inventories. For more information on Coach’s accounting
policies, please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Inventories

U.S. inventories are
valued at the lower of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out
method) or market. Inventories in Japan are valued at the lower of cost
(determined by the last-in, first-out method) or market. Inventory
costs include material, conversion costs, freight and duties. Reserves
for slow-moving and aged merchandise are provided based on historical
experience and current product demand. We evaluate the adequacy of
reserves quarterly. A decrease in product demand due to changing
customer tastes, buying patterns or increased competition could impact
Coach’s evaluation of its slow-moving and aged
merchandise.

Share-Based Compensation

During the
first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (‘‘SFAS’’)
123R, ‘‘Share-Based Payment,’’ which
requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date
fair value of the award. Previously, the Company accounted for
stock-based compensation plans and the employee stock purchase plan in
accordance with APB Opinion 25, ‘‘Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees’’ and related Interpretations and
provided the required pro forma disclosures of SFAS 123,
‘‘Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.’’ The Company elected to adopt the modified
retrospective application method as provided by SFAS 123R and
accordingly, all financial statement amounts for the prior periods
presented have been adjusted to reflect the cost of such awards based
on the grant-date fair value of the awards.

The determination of
the grant-date fair value of the awards involves several assumptions,
including expected term of the option and future volatility. The
expected term of options represents the period of time that the options
granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical
experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of
the Company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from
publicly traded options on Coach’s stock.

Valuation
of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets other than goodwill
and indefinite life intangible assets, which are separately tested for
impairment, are evaluated for impairment annually to determine if the
carrying value of the assets is recoverable. The evaluation is based on
a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of
the related business. The Company did not record any impairment losses
in fiscal 2006, 2005, or 2004.



Goodwill and Intangible
Assets

The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite life
intangible assets annually for impairment. In order to complete our
impairment analysis, we must perform a valuation analysis which
includes determining the fair value of the Company’s reporting
units based on discounted cash flows. This analysis contains
uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and
estimate the profitability of future growth strategies. The Company
determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2006, 2005 or
2004.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized
at the point of sale, which occurs when merchandise is sold in an
over-the-counter consumer transaction or, for the wholesale, Internet
and catalog channels, upon shipment of merchandise, when title passes
to the customer. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts,
discounts, returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded
based upon historical experience and current trends. Royalty revenues
are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other
consumer products that incorporate the Coach brand. Revenue earned
under these contracts is recognized based upon reported net sales from
the licensee.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November  2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) issued
SFAS 151, ‘‘Inventory Costs – an amendment
of ARB 43, Chapter 4.’’ SFAS 151 is an amendment
of Accounting Research Board Opinion 43 and sets standards for the
treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and spoilage. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 151
did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In December  2004, the FASB issued
Staff Position (‘‘FSP’’) 109-2,
‘‘Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004.’’ FSP 109-2 provides guidance under
SFAS 109, ‘‘Accounting for Income
Taxes,’’ with respect to recording the potential impact
of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the ‘‘Jobs Act’’) on
enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability. FSP
109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial
reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on
its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for
purposes of applying SFAS 109. As the Company did not make any
dividends under this provision, FSP 109-2 did not have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December  2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153,
‘‘Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets – an amendment of
APB Opinion 29,’’ which eliminates certain narrow
differences between APB 29 and international accounting
standards. SFAS 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning on
or after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 did not
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

In December  2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123
(revised 2004), ‘‘Share-Based Payment,’’
which is a revision of SFAS 123, ‘‘Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.’’ SFAS 123R supersedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, ‘‘Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.’’ The pronouncement requires
an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value
of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period during which
an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
– the requisite service period (typically the vesting period).
The Company adopted SFAS 123R effective July  3,  2005. See
Footnote 2 for further information.

In March  2005, the SEC
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (‘‘SAB’’)
107 ‘‘Share-Based Payment.’’ SAB 107
expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the interaction between SFAS
123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides the
staff’s views regarding the valuation of share-based payment
arrangements. The Company adopted SFAS 123R effective July
3,  2005. See Footnote 2 for further
information.



In March  2005, the FASB issued
SFAS Interpretation Number (‘‘FIN’’)
47, ‘‘Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations.’’ FIN 47 provides clarification
regarding the meaning of the term ‘‘conditional asset
retirement obligation’’ as used in FASB 143,
‘‘Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.’’ This Interpretation is effective no later
than the end of fiscal years ending after December  15,
2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In
June  2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(‘‘EITF’’) reached consensus on EITF 05-6,
‘‘Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold
Improvements.’’ Under EITF 05-6, leasehold improvements
placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near
the beginning of the lease term, should be amortized over the
lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes
renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold
improvements are purchased. EITF 05-6 is effective for periods
beginning after June  29,  2005. The adoption of EITF 05-6
did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In November  2005, the FASB issued
FSP 115-1 and 124-1, ‘‘The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments.’’ FSP’s 115-1 and 124-1 address the
determination as to when an investment is impaired, whether that
impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an
impairment loss. This FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning
after December  15,  2005. The adoption of FSP’s
115-1 and 124-1 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In November  2005, the
FASB issued FSP 123R-3, ‘‘Transition Election to
Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
Awards.’’ This FSP provides an alternative transition
method for calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to
absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of
Statement 123R. As the Company did not elect to adopt the alternative
transition method, this FSP did not impact the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In February  2006, the
FASB issued SFAS 155, ‘‘Accounting for Certain Hybrid
Financial Instruments – an amendment of FASB Statements 133 and
140.’’ SFAS 155 permits fair value measurement for any
hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that
otherwise would require bifurcation. This statement is effective for
all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an
entity’s fiscal year that begins after September
15,  2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 155
to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In June  2006, the EITF reached
consensus on EITF 06-3, ‘‘Disclosure Requirements for
Taxes Assessed by a Government Authority on Revenue-Producing
Transactions.’’ EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of a
company’s accounting policy with respect to presentation of
taxes collected on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and
a customer. For taxes that are reported on a gross basis (included in
revenues and costs), EITF 06-3 also requires disclosure of the amount
of taxes included in the financial statements. EITF 06-3 is effective
for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December  15,  2006. The Company does not expect the
adoption of EITF 06-3 to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In June  2006, the FASB
issued FIN 48, ‘‘Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement 109,’’
which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance
with FAS 109, ‘‘Accounting for Income
Taxes.’’ FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December  15,  2006. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of FIN 48 on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

ITEM 7A. – Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

The market risk inherent in our
financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value,
earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates
or foreign currency exchange rates. Coach manages these exposures
through operating and financing activities and, when



appropriate, through the use of derivative
financial instruments with respect to Coach Japan. The following
quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained
through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of
financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms
and maturities and theoretical pricing models. These quantitative
disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected
loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those
estimates.

Foreign Exchange

Foreign currency
exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and
anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the
entity’s functional currency, and from foreign-denominated
revenues and expenses translated into U.S. dollars.

Substantially
all of Coach’s fiscal 2006 non-licensed product needs were
purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the
United States. These countries include China, Hungary, India, Italy,
Korea, Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey.
Additionally, sales are made through international channels to third
party distributors. Substantially all purchases and sales involving
international parties, excluding Coach Japan, are denominated in U.S.
dollars and, therefore, are not hedged by Coach using any derivative
instruments.

Coach is exposed to market risk from foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to Coach Japan as a
result of its U.S. dollar denominated inventory purchases. Coach Japan,
enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily
foreign exchange forward contracts, to manage these risks. These
transactions are in accordance with Coach’s risk management
policies. Coach does not enter into derivative transactions for
speculative or trading purposes.

Coach is also exposed to market
risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to
Coach Japan as a result of its $231  million U.S. dollar
denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from Coach. To manage this
risk, on July  1,  2005, Coach Japan entered into a cross
currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a
U.S. dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate. The loan
matures in 2010, at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen
and U.S. dollar based principals.

The foreign currency contracts
entered into by the Company have durations no greater than
18 months. The fair values of open foreign currency
derivatives included in current assets at July  1,  2006
and July  2,  2005 were $2.6  million and $1.5
million, respectively. As of July  1,  2006 and July
2,  2005, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as
hedges with a notional amount of $114.8  million and $46.9
million were fair valued. For the year ended July  1,
2006, changes in derivative balances resulted in a reduction of other
comprehensive income of $4.5  million, net of taxes. For the year
ended July  2,  2005, changes in derivative balances
resulted in an increase of other comprehensive income of $1.2
million, net of taxes.

Interest Rate

Coach
faces minimal interest rate risk exposure in relation to its
outstanding debt of $3.3  million at July  1,  2006.
A hypothetical 1% change in the interest rate applied to the
fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash
flows of Coach.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of

Coach, Inc.

New York, New York

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coach,
Inc. and subsidiaries (the ‘‘Company’’) as
of July  1,  2006 and July  2,  2005, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
July  1,  2006. Our audits also included the consolidated
financial statement schedule listed at Item 15. These consolidated
financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company at July
1,  2006 and July  2,  2005, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended July  1,  2006 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal 2006 the
Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation
to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

, and, adjusted all prior periods presented
in accordance with the modified retrospective method.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
July  1,  2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
our report dated August  24,  2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of

Coach, Inc.

New York, New
York

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Coach, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the ‘‘Company’’) maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of July
1,  2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control
– Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and
effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of
the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of July  1,  2006, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also,
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of July
1,  2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated financial statements and consolidated
financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended July
1,  2006 of the Company and our report dated August
24,  2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements and consolidated financial statement schedule and
included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company’s
change in fiscal 2006 of its method of accounting for stock-based
compensation.

Nature of Operations and
Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Coach, Inc. (the ‘‘Company’’) designs
and markets high-quality, modern American classic accessories. The
Company’s primary product offerings, manufactured by third-party
suppliers, include handbags, women’s and men’s
accessories, outerwear, business, travel, watches, footwear and
eyewear. Coach’s products are sold through direct-to-consumer
channels, including Company-operated stores in North America and Japan,
its online store and its catalogs, as well as through indirect
channels, including department store locations in the United States,
international department stores, freestanding retail locations and
specialty retailers.

Significant Accounting
Policies

Fiscal year

The Company’s
fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to June  30. Unless
otherwise stated, references to years in the financial statements
relate to fiscal years. The fiscal years ended July  1,
2006 (‘‘fiscal 2006’’) and July
2,  2005 (‘‘fiscal 2005’’) were each
52-week periods, whereas the fiscal year ended July  3,
2004 (‘‘fiscal 2004’’) was a 53-week
period.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The level of
uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of
time until the underlying transactions are completed. Actual results
could differ from estimates in amounts that may be material to the
financial statements.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries under the control of the
Company, including Coach Japan, Inc. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
consist of cash balances and highly liquid investments with a maturity
of less than 90 days at the date of purchase.



COACH,
INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share
data)

Investments

Investments
consist of U.S. government and agency debt securities as well as
municipal government and corporate debt securities. These securities
are classified as held to maturity, as the Company has both the ability
and the intent to hold these securities until maturity. Investments are
recorded at amortized cost. Premiums are amortized and discounts are
accreted over the lives of the related securities as adjustments to
interest income. Dividend and interest income are recognized when
earned.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially expose Coach to concentration of credit
risk consist primarily of cash investments and accounts receivable. The
Company places its cash investments with high-credit quality financial
institutions and currently invests primarily in U.S. government and
agency debt securities, municipal government and corporate debt
securities, and bank money market funds placed with major banks and
financial institutions. Accounts receivable is generally diversified
due to the number of entities comprising Coach’s customer base
and their dispersion across many geographical regions. The Company
believes no significant concentration of credit risk exists with
respect to these cash investments and accounts
receivable.

Inventories

Inventories consist
primarily of finished goods. U.S. inventories are valued at the lower
of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out method
(‘‘FIFO’’)) or market. Inventories in Japan
are valued at the lower of cost (determined by the last-in, first-out
method (‘‘LIFO’’)) or market. At the end of
fiscal 2006 and 2005, inventories recorded at LIFO were $911 and $17
lower, respectively, than if they were valued at FIFO. Inventories
valued under LIFO amounted to $54,651 and $40,861 in fiscal 2006 and
2005, respectively. Inventory costs include material, conversion costs,
freight and duties.

Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Machinery and
equipment are depreciated over lives of five to seven years and
furniture and fixtures are depreciated over lives of three to five
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their
estimated useful lives or the related lease terms. Maintenance and
repair costs are charged to earnings as incurred while expenditures for
major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Upon the disposition
of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts.

Operating
Leases

The Company's leases for office space, retail
stores and the distribution facility are accounted for as operating
leases. The majority of the Company’s lease agreements provide
for tenant improvement allowances, rent escalation clauses and/or
contingent rent provisions. Tenant improvement allowances are recorded
as a deferred lease credit on the balance sheet and amortized over the
lease term, which is consistent with the amortization period for the
constructed assets. Rent expense is recorded when the Company takes
possession of a store to begin its buildout, which generally occurs
before the stated commencement of the lease term and is approximately
60 to 90 days prior to the opening of the store.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and
indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the asset might be impaired. The



COACH,
INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share
data)

Company performed an impairment evaluation in
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 and concluded that there was no impairment
of its goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(‘‘SFAS’’) 144, ‘‘Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,’’
the Company assesses the carrying value of its long-lived assets for
possible impairment based on a review of forecasted operating cash
flows and the profitability of the related business. The Company did
not record any impairment losses in fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized at the point
of sale, which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over-the-counter
consumer transaction or, for the wholesale, Internet and catalog
channels, upon shipment of merchandise, when title passes to the
customer. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts
and returns are provided when sales are recorded. Royalty revenues are
earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer
products that incorporate the Coach brand. Revenue earned under these
contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the
licensee.

Advertising

Advertising costs include
direct marketing activities, such as catalogs, as well as media and
production. In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, advertising expenses totaled
$35,887, $39,038, and $38,471, respectively, and are included in
selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs are
expensed when the advertising first appears.

Share-Based
Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based compensation
in accordance with SFAS 123R, ‘‘Share-Based
Payment.’’ Accordingly, the Company measures the cost of
employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling costs
incurred were $19,927, $16,188, and $13,080 in fiscal years 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively, and are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses.

Income Taxes

The Company
accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109,
‘‘Accounting for Income Taxes.’’ Under SFAS
109, a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their
respective tax bases. Coach does not provide for U.S. income taxes on
the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as the Company
intends to permanently reinvest these earnings.

Minority
Interest in Subsidiary

Minority interest in the statements of
income represents Sumitomo Corporation’s share of the earnings
in Coach Japan prior to the July  1,  2005 purchase of
Sumitomo’s 50% interest in Coach Japan.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

The fair value of the revolving credit facility at
July  1,  2006 and July  2,  2005 approximated
its carrying value due to its floating interest rates. The Company has
evaluated its Industrial Revenue Bond and believes, based on the
interest rate, related term and maturity, that the fair value of such
instrument approximates its carrying amount. As of July
1,  2006 and July  2,  2005, the carrying values of
cash and cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximated their values due
to the short-term maturities of these accounts. See Note 4,
‘‘Investments,’’ for the fair values of the
Company’s investments as of July  1,  2006.

Coach Japan enters into foreign currency forward contracts that
hedge certain U.S. dollar denominated inventory risks. These contracts
have been designated for hedge accounting. The fair value of these
contracts is recognized in other comprehensive income. The fair value
of the foreign currency derivative is based on its market value as
determined by an independent party. However, considerable judgment is
required in developing estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the
estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts that Coach could settle in a current market exchange. The use
of different market assumptions or methodologies could affect the
estimated fair value.

Foreign Currency

The
functional currency of the Company's foreign operations is the
applicable local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance
sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the
weighted-average exchange rates for the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’
equity.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per
share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average
number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per
share is calculated similarly but includes potential dilution from the
exercise of stock options and stock awards.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In November  2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’)
issued SFAS 151, ‘‘Inventory Costs – an
amendment of ARB 43, Chapter 4.’’ SFAS 151 is an
amendment of Accounting Research Board Opinion 43 and sets standards
for the treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and spoilage. SFAS 151 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS
151 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In December  2004, the FASB issued
Staff Position (‘‘FSP’’) 109-2,
‘‘Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004.’’ FSP 109-2 provides guidance under
SFAS 109, ‘‘Accounting for Income
Taxes,’’ with respect to recording the potential impact
of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the ‘‘Jobs Act’’) on
enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability. FSP
109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial
reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on
its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for
purposes of applying SFAS 109. As the Company did not make any
dividends under this provision, FSP 109-2 did not have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December  2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153,
‘‘Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets – an amendment of
APB Opinion 29,’’ which eliminates certain narrow
differences between APB 29 and



COACH,
INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

international accounting standards.
SFAS 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after
June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

In December  2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123
(revised 2004), ‘‘Share-Based Payment,’’
which is a revision of SFAS 123, ‘‘Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.’’ SFAS 123R supersedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, ‘‘Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.’’ The pronouncement requires
an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value
of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period during which
an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award
– the requisite service period (typically the vesting period).
The Company adopted SFAS 123R effective July  3,  2005. See
Footnote 2 for further information.

In March  2005, the SEC
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (‘‘SAB’’)
107 ‘‘Share-Based Payment.’’ SAB 107
expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the interaction between SFAS
123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides the
staff’s views regarding the valuation of share-based payment
arrangements. The Company adopted SFAS 123R effective July
3,  2005. See Footnote 2 for further information.

In
March  2005, the FASB issued SFAS Interpretation
Number (‘‘FIN’’) 47,
‘‘Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations.’’ FIN 47 provides clarification
regarding the meaning of the term ‘‘conditional asset
retirement obligation’’ as used in FASB 143,
‘‘Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.’’ This Interpretation is effective no later
than the end of fiscal years ending after December  15,
2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In
June  2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(‘‘EITF’’) reached consensus on EITF 05-6,
‘‘Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold
Improvements.’’ Under EITF 05-6, leasehold improvements
placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near
the beginning of the lease term, should be amortized over the
lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes
renewals that are reasonably assured at the date the leasehold
improvements are purchased. EITF 05-6 is effective for periods
beginning after June  29,  2005. The adoption of EITF 05-6
did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In November  2005, the FASB issued
FSP 115-1 and 124-1, ‘‘The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments.’’ FSP’s 115-1 and 124-1 address the
determination as to when an investment is impaired, whether that
impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an
impairment loss. This FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning
after December  15,  2005. The adoption of FSP’s
115-1 and 124-1 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In November  2005, the
FASB issued FSP 123R-3, ‘‘Transition Election to
Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
Awards.’’ This FSP provides an alternative transition
method for calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to
absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of
Statement 123R. As the Company did not elect to adopt the alternative
transition method, this FSP did not impact the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In February  2006, the
FASB issued SFAS 155, ‘‘Accounting for Certain Hybrid
Financial Instruments – an amendment of FASB Statements 133 and
140.’’ SFAS 155 permits fair value measurement for any
hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that
otherwise would require bifurcation. This statement is effective for
all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an
entity’s fiscal year that begins after September
15,  2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 155
to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In June  2006, the EITF reached
consensus on EITF 06-3, ‘‘Disclosure Requirements for
Taxes Assessed by a Government Authority on Revenue-Producing
Transactions.’’ EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of a
company’s accounting policy with respect to presentation of
taxes collected on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and
a customer. For taxes that are reported on a gross basis (included in
revenues and costs), EITF 06-3 also requires disclosure of the amount
of taxes included in the financial statements. EITF 06-3 is effective
for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December  15,  2006. The Company does not expect the
adoption of EITF 06-3 to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

In June  2006, the FASB
issued FIN 48, ‘‘Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement 109,’’
which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance
with FAS 109, ‘‘Accounting for Income
Taxes.’’ FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December  15,  2006. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of FIN 48 on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.

Share-Based
Compensation

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the
Company adopted SFAS 123R, ‘‘Share-Based
Payment,’’ which requires an entity to measure the cost
of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
Previously, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation plans
and the employee stock purchase plan in accordance with APB Opinion 25,
‘‘Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees’’ and related Interpretations and provided the
required pro forma disclosures of SFAS 123, ‘‘Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation.’’ The Company elected to
adopt the modified retrospective application method as provided by SFAS
123R and accordingly, all financial statement amounts for the prior
periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the cost of such awards
based on the grant-date fair value of the awards.

The Company
maintains several share-based compensation plans which are more fully
described below. The total compensation cost charged against income for
these plans was $69,190, $55,880 and $43,571 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the
income statement for share-based compensation arrangements was $27,191,
$21,793 and $17,093 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Stock-Based Plans

Coach maintains the 2000 Stock Incentive
Plan, the 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and the 2004 Stock
Incentive Plan to award stock options, shares and other forms of equity
compensation to certain members of Coach management and the outside
members of its Board of Directors. These plans were approved by
Coach’s stockholders. The exercise price of each stock option
equals the market price of Coach’s stock on the date of grant
and generally

has a maximum term of 10 years. Options
generally vest ratably over three years. Share awards are restricted
and subject to forfeiture until the retention period is completed. The
retention period is generally three years.

For options granted
under Coach’s stock option plans prior to July  1,
2003, an active employee can receive a replacement stock option equal
to the number of shares surrendered upon a stock-for-stock exercise.
The exercise price of the replacement option equals the market value at
the date of exercise of the original option and will remain exercisable
for the remaining term of the original option. Replacement stock
options generally vest six months from the grant date. Replacement
stock options of 5,378, 7,029, and 11,264, were granted in fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

A summary of option activity under
the Coach stock option plans as of July  1,  2006 and
changes during the year then ended is as
follows:

The
following table summarizes information about stock options under the
Coach option plans at July  1,  2006:



COACH,
INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
– (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share
data)

The fair value of each Coach option grant
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model and the following weighted-average
assumptions:

The
expected term of options represents the period of time that the options
granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical
experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of
the Company’s stock as well as the implied volatility from
publicly traded options on Coach’s stock. The risk free interest
rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury issue as of the date of
the grant. As Coach does not pay dividends, the dividend yield is
0%.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options
granted during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $8.49, $3.10, and $2.45,
respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $232,507, $201,232, and $263,124,
respectively. The total cash received from these option exercises was
$86,550, $46,835 and $34,141 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and the actual tax benefit realized for the tax
deductions from these option exercises was $88,534, $78,480 and
$106,458, respectively.

The grant-date fair value of each Coach
share award is equal to the fair value of Coach stock at the grant
date. The following table summarizes information about nonvested shares
as of and for the year ended July  1,
2006:

The
total fair value of shares vested during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
$27,593, $5,829 and $526, respectively.

As of July
1,  2006, there was $91,565 of total unrecognized compensation
cost related to non-vested stock options and stock awards. This cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8
years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, full-time Coach employees are permitted
to purchase a limited number of Coach common shares at 85% of
market value. Under this plan, Coach sold 162, 159, and 200 shares to
employees in fiscal 2006, 2005 and



COACH,
INC.

2004, respectively. Compensation expense is
calculated for the fair value of employees’ purchase rights
using the Black-Scholes model and the following weighted-average
assumptions:

The
weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted during
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $6.64, $6.24, and $4.85,
respectively.

Deferred Compensation

Under the
Coach, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, executive officers
and certain employees at or above the senior director level may elect
to defer all or a portion of their annual bonus or annual base salary
into the plan. Under the Coach, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors, Coach's outside directors may similarly
defer their director's fees. Amounts deferred under these plans
may, at the participants' election, be either represented by
deferred stock units, which represent the right to receive shares of
Coach common stock on the distribution date elected by the participant,
or placed in an interest-bearing account to be paid on such
distribution date. The amounts accrued under these plans at July
1,  2006 and July  2,  2005 were $3,622 and $4,777,
respectively, and are included in other noncurrent liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets.

The following table summarizes
share and exercise price information about Coach’s equity
compensation plans as of July  1,
2006:

Leases

Coach
leases certain office, distribution and retail facilities. The lease
agreements, which expire at various dates through 2020, are subject, in
some cases, to renewal options and provide for the payment of taxes,
insurance and maintenance. Certain leases contain escalation clauses
resulting from the pass-through of increases in operating costs,
property taxes and the effect on costs from changes in consumer price
indices. Certain rentals are also contingent upon factors such as
sales. Rent-free periods and scheduled rent increases are recorded as
components of rent expense on a straight-line basis over the related
terms of such leases. Contingent rentals are recognized when the
achievement of the target (i.e., sales levels), which triggers the
related payment, is considered probable. Rent expense for the
Company's operating leases consisted of the
following:

Future
minimum rental payments under noncancelable operating leases are as
follows:

Certain
operating leases provide for renewal for periods of five to ten years
at their fair rental value at the time of renewal. In the normal course
of business, operating leases are generally renewed or replaced by new
leases.

4.

Investments

The Company’s investments consist of U.S. government
and agency debt securities as well as municipal government and
corporate debt securities. As the Company has both the ability and the
intent to hold these securities until maturity, all investments are
classified as held to maturity and stated at amortized cost. The
following table shows the amortized cost, fair value, and unrealized
gains and losses of the Company’s investments at July
1,  2006 and July  2,  2005:



COACH,
INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share
data)

Securities
with maturity dates within one year are classified as short-term
investments. Securities with maturity dates greater than one year are
classified as long-term investments. Actual maturities could differ
from contractual maturities, as some borrowers have the right to call
certain obligations.

As of July  1,  2006, U.S.
corporate debt securities with a fair value of $20,000 and an
unrealized loss of $100 have been in an unrealized loss position for
less than twelve months. The remaining corporate debt securities and
the U.S. government and agency securities have been in an unrealized
loss position for greater than twelve months.

U.S.
Government and Agency Securities

The unrealized loss on
Coach’s investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) bond was
caused by interest rate increases. Coach purchased this
investment at a discount relative to its face amount, and the
contractual cash flow of this investment is guaranteed by FHLB, which
is an agency of the U.S. government. Accordingly, it is expected
that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the
amortized cost of the Company’s investment. Because the
decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates
and not credit quality, and because Coach has the ability and intent to
hold this investment until a recovery of fair value, which may be
maturity, Coach does not consider this investment to be
other-than-temporarily impaired at July  1,
2006.

Corporate Debt Securities

The unrealized loss
on Coach’s investments in corporate bonds was caused by interest
rate increases. It is expected that the securities would not be
settled at a price less than the amortized cost of Coach's
investment. Because the decline in market value is attributable
to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because Coach
has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery
of fair value, which may be maturity, Coach does not consider these
investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at July
1,  2006.

5.

Debt

Revolving Credit Facilities

On October
16,  2003, Coach, certain lenders and the Bank of America, N.A.
(‘‘Bank of America’’), as primary lender
and administrative agent, renewed the $100,000 senior unsecured
revolving credit facility (the ‘‘Bank of America
facility’’), extending the facility expiration to
October  16,  2006. On June  23,  2005, this
facility was extended for one additional year, to October
16,  2007. At Coach’s request, the Bank of America
facility can be expanded to $125,000. This facility is available for
seasonal working capital requirements or general corporate purposes and
may be prepaid without penalty or premium.



COACH,
INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share
data)

During fiscal 2006 and 2005, there were no
borrowings under the Bank of America facility. Accordingly, as of
July  1,  2006 and July  2,  2005, there were
no outstanding borrowings under the Bank of America facility.

Coach pays a commitment fee of 10 to 25 basis points on any unused
amounts of the Bank of America facility and interest of LIBOR plus 45
to 100 basis points on any outstanding borrowings. The initial
commitment fee was 15 basis points and the initial LIBOR margin was
62.5 basis points. At July  1,  2006, the commitment fee
was 10 basis points and the LIBOR margin was 45 basis points,
reflecting an improvement in our fixed-charge coverage ratio.

The Bank of America facility contains various covenants and
customary events of default. The Company has been in compliance with
all covenants since its inception.

To provide funding for working
capital and general corporate purposes, Coach Japan entered into credit
facilities with several Japanese financial institutions. These
facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 7.6  billion yen, or
approximately $66,000, at July  1,  2006. Interest is based
on the Tokyo Interbank rate plus a margin of up to 50 basis points.

These facilities contain various covenants and customary events of
default. Coach Japan has been in compliance with all covenants since
their inception. These facilities include automatic renewals based on
compliance with the covenants. Coach, Inc. is not a guarantor on any of
these facilities.

During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the peak
borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities were $21,568 and
$50,461, respectively. As of July  1,  2006 and July
2,  2005, outstanding borrowings under the Japanese credit
facilities were $0 and $12,292, respectively.

Long-Term Debt

Coach is party to an Industrial Revenue Bond related to
its Jacksonville, Florida facility. This loan bears interest at
4.5%. Principal and interest payments are made semi-annually,
with the final payment due in 2014. As of July  1,  2006
and July  2,  2005, the remaining balance on the loan was
$3,270 and $3,420, respectively. Future principal payments under the
Industrial Revenue Bond are as follows:

Commitments
and Contingencies

At July  1,  2006 and July
2,  2005, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling
$91,855 and $68,849, respectively. Of these amounts, $15,057 and
$15,425, respectively, relate to the letter of credit obtained in
connection with leases transferred to the Company by the Sara Lee
Corporation, for which Sara Lee retains contingent liability. Coach
expects that it will be required to maintain the letter of credit for
approximately 10 years. The remaining letters of credit, which expire
at various dates through 2010, primarily collateralize the
Company’s obligation to third parties for the purchase of
inventory and lease guarantees.



COACH,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share
data)

Coach is a party to employment agreements
with certain executives which provide for compensation and other
benefits. The agreements also provide for severance payments under
certain circumstances. On August  22,  2005, the Company
entered into three-year extensions to the employment agreements of
three key executives: Lew Frankfort, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer; Reed Krakoff, President and Executive Creative Director; and
Keith Monda, President and Chief Operating Officer. These amendments
extend the terms of the executives’ employment agreements from
July  2008 through August  2011. On November
8,  2005, Coach entered into five-year employment agreements with
two key executives: Michael Tucci, President, North America Retail
Division, and Michael F. Devine, III, Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer. The terms of these employment agreements run through
June  30,  2010.

In the ordinary course of business,
Coach is a party to several pending legal proceedings and claims.
Although the outcome of such items cannot be determined with certainty,
Coach's general counsel and management are of the opinion that
the final outcome will not have a material effect on Coach's cash
flow, results of operations or financial position.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

Substantially all purchases and sales involving
international parties are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, the
Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations with respect to Coach Japan as a result of Coach
Japan’s U.S. dollar-denominated inventory purchases. Coach Japan
enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily
foreign exchange forward contracts, to manage these risks. These
transactions are in accordance with the Company’s risk
management policies. Coach does not enter into derivative transactions
for speculative or trading purposes.

Coach is also exposed to
market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with
respect to Coach Japan as a result of its $231,000 U.S. dollar
denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from Coach. To manage this
risk, on July  1,  2005, Coach Japan entered into a cross
currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a
U.S. dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate. The loan
matures in 2010, at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen
and U.S. dollar based principals.

The foreign currency contracts

Significant
judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income
taxes, and there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax
outcome is uncertain. It is the Company’s policy to establish
provisions for taxes that may become payable in future years as a
result of an examination by tax authorities. The Company establishes
the provisions based upon management’s assessment of exposure
associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits. The
provisions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events
occur that warrant adjustments to those
provisions.

Retirement
Plans

Coach maintains the Coach, Inc. Savings and Profit Sharing
Plan, which is a defined contribution plan. Employees who meet certain
eligibility requirements and are not part of a collective bargaining
agreement may participate in this program. The annual expense incurred
by Coach for this defined contribution plan was $7,714, $8,621, and
$7,620 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Coach sponsors a noncontributory defined
benefit plan, The Coach, Inc. Supplemental Pension Plan, (the
‘‘U.S. Plan’’) for individuals who are part
of collective bargaining arrangements in the U.S. The U.S. Plan
provides benefits based on years of service. Coach Japan sponsors a
defined benefit plan for individuals who meet certain eligibility
requirements. This plan provides benefits based on employees’
years of service and earnings.

The Company uses a March
31 measurement date for its defined benefit retirement plans.
Obligation and funded status information for the Company’s
defined benefit retirement plans is as

Fiscal
2005 did not include the Coach Japan defined benefit plan. As the U.S.
Plan provides benefits based on years of service only, the rate of
compensation increase assumption was not applicable in fiscal
2005.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of
expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds),
the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other
asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations
for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each
asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to
develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption
for the portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 6.75%
assumption for the fiscal year ended July  1,  2006.



COACH,

In the Company’s U.S. Plan, funds
are contributed to a trust in accordance with regulatory limits. The
weighted-average asset allocations of the U.S. Plan, by asset category,
as of the measurement dates, are as follows:

The
goals of the investment program are to fully fund the obligation to pay
retirement benefits in accordance with the Coach, Inc. Supplemental
Pension Plan and to provide returns which, along with appropriate
funding from Coach, maintain an asset/liability ratio that is in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and assures timely
payment of retirement benefits. The target allocation range of
percentages for each major category of plan assets are as follows:

The equity
securities category includes common stocks, preferred stocks, and
co-mingled funds of approved securities. The target allocation of
securities is a maximum of 5% of equity assets in any one
individual common or preferred stock and a maximum of 15% in any
one mutual fund.

Coach expects to contribute $355 to its U.S.
Plan during the year ending June  30,  2007. In addition,
Coach Japan expects to contribute $111 for benefit payments during the
year ending June  30,  2007. The following benefit
payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are
expected to be
paid:

Segment
Information

The Company operates its business in two reportable
segments: Direct-to-Consumer and Indirect. The Company's
reportable segments represent channels of distribution that offer
similar merchandise, service and marketing strategies. Sales of Coach
products through Company-operated stores in North America and Japan,
the Internet and the Coach catalog constitute the Direct-to-Consumer
segment. The Indirect segment includes sales of Coach products to other
retailers and royalties earned on licensed products. In deciding how to
allocate resources and assess performance, Coach's executive
officers regularly evaluate the sales and operating income of these
segments. Operating income is the

INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share
data)

gross margin of the segment less direct
expenses of the segment. Unallocated corporate expenses include
production variances, general marketing, administration and information
systems, as well as distribution and consumer service
expenses.

As a result of Coach’s acquisition of
Sumitomo’s 50% interest in Coach Japan on July
1,  2005, the Company reevaluated the composition of its
reportable segments and determined that Coach Japan should be a
component of the Direct-to-Consumer segment. Previously, Coach Japan
was included in the Indirect segment. All prior period information has
been reclassified to include Coach Japan as a component of the
Direct-to-Consumer segment.

Business
Interruption Insurance

In the fiscal year ended June
29,  2002, Coach’s World Trade Center location was
completely destroyed as a result of the September

th

terrorist attack. Inventory and fixed asset loss claims
were filed with the Company’s insurers and these losses were
fully recovered. Losses covered under the Company’s business
interruption insurance program were also filed with the insurers.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company reached a final
settlement with its insurance carriers related to losses covered under
the business interruption insurance program. Accordingly, the Company
does not expect to receive any additional business interruption
proceeds related to the World Trade Center location in the future.

During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, Coach received payments of
$2,025, $2,644, and $2,657, respectively, under its business
interruption coverage. These amounts are included as a reduction to
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Earnings Per
Share

The following is a reconciliation of the weighted-average
shares outstanding and calculation of basic and diluted earnings per
share:

At
July  1,  2006, options to purchase 13,202 shares of common
stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share, as these options’ exercise prices, ranging

the common shares.

At July  2,  2005, options to
purchase 1,093 shares of common stock were outstanding but not included

options’ exercise prices, ranging from $29.75 to $32.79, were
greater than the average market price of the common shares.

At
July  3,  2004, options to purchase 4,306 shares of common

the common shares.

Stock Repurchase
Program

The Coach Board of Directors approved common stock
repurchase programs as
follows:

Purchases of Coach’s common stock will
be made from time to time, subject to market conditions and at
prevailing market prices, through open market purchases. Repurchased
shares of common stock will become authorized but unissued shares and
may be issued in the future for general corporate and other purposes.
The Company may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any
time.

and retired 19,055, 11,000, and 3,022 shares of common stock at an
average cost of $31.50, $24.09, and $18.18 per share, respectively. As

Shareholder
Rights Plan

On May  3,  2001, Coach declared a
‘‘poison pill’’ dividend distribution of
rights to buy additional common stock, to the holder of each
outstanding share of Coach’s common stock.

Subject to
limited exceptions, these rights may be exercised if a person or group
intentionally acquires 10% or more of the Company’s
common stock or announces a tender offer for 10% or more of the
common stock on terms not approved by the Coach Board of Directors. In
this event, each right would entitle the holder of each share of
Coach’s common stock to buy one additional common share of the
Company at an exercise price far below the then-current market price.
Subject to certain

INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share
data)

exceptions, Coach’s Board of
Directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at $0.0001 per right at
any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either
the public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of
Coach’s Board of Directors becomes aware that, a person has
acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. As of the
end of fiscal 2006, there were no shareholders whose common stock
holdings exceeded the 10% threshold established by the rights
plan.

for each quarter and the full year are performed independently.
