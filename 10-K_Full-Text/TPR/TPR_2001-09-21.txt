Business of Coach,
Inc.

OVERVIEW

Coach (“Coach” or the
“Company”) is a designer, producer and marketer of
high-quality, modern American classic accessories. Coach
believes that it is one of the best recognized leather goods
brands in the U.S. and is enjoying increased recognition in
targeted international markets. Net sales were $616.1 million in
the year ended June 30, 2001 (“fiscal 2001”),
$548.9 million in the year ended July 1, 2000,
(“fiscal 2000”) and $507.8 million in the year
ended July 3, 1999 (“fiscal 1999”). Operating
income before reorganization costs was $106.3 million in
fiscal 2001, $56.0 million in fiscal 2000 and
$19.5 million in fiscal 1999. Coach’s primary product
offerings include handbags, women’s and men’s
accessories, business cases, luggage and travel accessories,
leather outerwear, gloves, scarves and personal planning
products. Together with its licensing partners, Coach also
offers watches, footwear and home and office furniture with the
Coach brand name. Coach’s products are sold through a
number of direct to consumer channels, which at the end of
fiscal 2001 included:

Coach’s direct to consumer business
represented approximately 64% of its total sales in fiscal 2001.
Its remaining sales were generated from products sold through a
number of indirect channels, which at the end of fiscal 2001
included:

•

approximately 1,400 department store and
	specialty retailer locations in the U.S.;

•

approximately 175 international department store,
	retail store and duty free shop locations in 18 countries; and

•

corporate sales programs.

Founded in 1941, Coach has grown from a
family-run workshop in a Manhattan loft to a premier accessories
marketer in the U.S. Coach developed its initial expertise in
the small-scale production of classic, high-quality leather
goods constructed from “glove-tanned” leather with
close attention to detail. By the 1980s, Coach had grown into a
niche maker and marketer of traditionally styled, high-quality
leather goods with expanding national brand recognition, selling
its products through upscale department and specialty stores,
its own retail stores and its direct mail catalog. Coach has
built upon its national brand awareness, expanded into
international sales, particularly in Japan and East Asia,
diversified its product offerings beyond leather handbags,
further developed its multi-channel distribution strategy and
licensed products with the Coach brand name.

Coach’s net sales grew at a compound annual
growth rate of approximately 32%, from $19.0 million in
1985 to $540.4 million in fiscal year 1997. In fiscal years
1998 and 1999 Coach experienced sales declines of 3.4% and 2.8%,
respectively. These declines were primarily the result of
changes in consumer preferences from leather to mixed material
and non-leather products, which some of Coach’s competitors
offered, and diminished demand for Coach’s products due to
the economic downturn in Asia. During fiscal years 1997 through
1999, Coach also experienced reduced profitability.

During this period, Coach embarked on a
fundamental transformation of its brand. Coach repositioned its
image in a modern, fashionable direction to make it more
appealing to consumers. Coach built upon its popular core
categories by introducing new products in a broader array of
materials and styles to respond to consumers’ demands for
both fashion and function and it introduced new product
categories. In 1999, Coach



began renovating its retail stores, select U.S.
department store locations and key international locations to
create a modern environment to showcase its new product
assortments and reinforce a consistent brand position. Over the
last three years Coach also has been implementing a flexible,
cost-effective manufacturing model in which independent
manufacturers supply the majority of its products which allows
Coach to bring its broader range of products to market more
rapidly and efficiently.

Coach believes that these strategic initiatives
have succeeded in repositioning the Company as a modern
lifestyle accessories brand. In fiscal 2001 net sales increased
12.2% and earnings from operations before reorganization costs
increased 89.7% compared to fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2000, net
sales increased 8.1% and earnings from operations before
reorganization costs increased 110.7%, compared to fiscal 1999.

Coach has developed a number of strengths
including:

However, to remain competitive in its industry,
Coach must also accurately anticipate consumer trends and tastes.

Growth Strategies

Based on its established strengths Coach is
pursuing the following strategies for future growth:

Accelerate New Product Development.

Coach is accelerating the
development of new products, styles and product categories that
support its image as a broader lifestyle accessories brand
through:

During fiscal 2001, approximately 68% of
Coach’s net sales were generated from products introduced
during this period, including new product categories and line
extensions.

Modernize Retail Presentation.

Coach is modernizing its brand
image by remodeling its retail stores to create a distinctive
environment to showcase its new product assortments and
reinforce a consistent brand position. These renovated retail
stores have demonstrated significantly higher comparable store
sales growth



relative to unrenovated stores. Coach has
recently expanded and rebuilt its New York and San Francisco
flagship stores in this modern format. Coach expects that:

•

all of its retail stores will reflect the new
	store design by June 2002;

•

78 international locations were converted to, or
	opened with, the new store design by June 2001 and approximately
	62 locations will be remodeled or opened in the new store design
	by June 2002;

•

24 leading U.S. department store locations were
	remodeled by June 2001 and approximately 25 additional locations
	will be remodeled by June 2002.

Increase U.S. Retail Store Openings.

Coach opened 15 new U.S. retail
stores in fiscal year 2001 and eight in fiscal 2000. In each of
the next two years, the Company plans to expand its network of
121 retail stores by opening at least 20 new stores per year
located primarily in high volume markets. Coach believes that it
has a successful retail store format that reinforces its brand
image, generates strong sales per square foot and can be readily
adapted to different location requirements. The modernized store
environment, as exemplified by the Coach flagship store at 57th
Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan, has an open, loft-like
feeling, with crisp white brick walls, ebony-stained wood floors
and a timeless, uncluttered look. It generally takes four to six
months from the time the Company takes possession of a store to
open it.

Further Penetrate International Markets.

Coach is increasing its
international distribution and targeting international consumers
generally, and Japanese consumers in particular, to take
advantage of substantial growth opportunities for the Company.
Its current network of international distributors serves markets
in Japan, Australia, the Caribbean, Korea, Hong Kong and
Singapore. Coach has significant opportunities to increase sales
through existing and new international distribution channels.
Coach believes Japanese consumers represent a major growth
opportunity because they spend substantially more on a per
capita basis on handbags than U.S. consumers.

In June 2001

,

Coach Japan, Inc.
(“CJI”) was formed. This entity is a joint venture
with Sumitomo Corporation and will manage the Coach business in
Japan. Coach owns 50% of CJI and has appointed a majority of the
Board of Directors. It will be accounted for as a consolidated
subsidiary.

CJI plans to open additional locations within
existing major retailers, enter new department store
relationships and open freestanding retail locations. There are
currently a total of 76 Coach locations in Japan, including 62
department stores and 14 retail stores managed by two
distributors.

On July 31, 2001, CJI completed the purchase
of 100% of the capital stock of PDC from the Mitsukoshi
Department Store Group (“Mitsukoshi”) for a total
purchase price of $7.2 million. Mitsukoshi established PDC
in 1991 to expand Coach distribution to select department stores
throughout Japan. With this acquisition, CJI will manage all
locations currently operated by Mitsukoshi, who will remain a
key retailer for the brand. Excess purchase price over fair
market value of the underlying net assets was allocated to
goodwill based on preliminary estimates of fair values, and is
subject to adjustment. Goodwill will be reviewed annually for
impairment. The fair value of assets acquired was
$21.1 million and liabilities assumed was
$15.4 million. Included in the liabilities is an assumption
of debt of $13.4 million. Annual net sales of PDC for the
fiscal year ended February 28, 2001 were approximately
$48 million. In August 2001 operations commenced. Unaudited
pro forma information related to this acquisition is not
included, as the impact of this transaction is not material to
the consolidated results of the Company.

Improve Operational Efficiencies.

Coach upgraded and reorganized its
manufacturing, distribution and information systems over the
past five years to allow the Company to bring new and existing
products to market more efficiently. While maintaining its
quality control standards, Coach has shifted the majority of its
manufacturing processes from owned domestic factories to
independent manufacturers in lower cost markets. As a result,
Coach has increased its flexibility, improved its quality and
lowered its costs. In fiscal 2001, Coach’s gross margin
increased to 64.5% from 59.9% during fiscal 2000. Coach intends
to continue to increase efficiencies in its sourcing,
manufacturing and distribution processes by:

•

strengthening the coordination of design,
	merchandising, product development and manufacturing to
	streamline product introduction;



Promote Gift Purchases of its Products.

Coach believes that a substantial
amount of its U.S. sales are gift purchases because of the
Company’s higher sales during the holiday season. Coach
intends to further promote the Coach brand as an appealing
resource for gift-giving occasions by developing new products
well-suited for gift selection, such as coin purses, mirrors,
notepad holders and card cases in new styles and designs. In
addition, Coach’s marketing communication efforts,
including advertising, catalog mailings and outbound e-mails,
are timed to reach consumers before important holidays
throughout the year.

For holiday 2001, the Company will be introducing
proprietary packaging designed to further enhance the experience
of buying or receiving a gift from Coach.

Capitalize on Growing Interest in
e-Commerce.

In October 1999 Coach
launched its on-line store. Coach’s website meets growing
consumer demand for the flexibility and convenience of shopping
over the Internet by offering a selective array of its products.
Coach views its website, like its catalogs, as a key
communications vehicle for the brand that also promotes store
traffic.

Coach’s Products

Handbags.

Coach’s original business was
the design, manufacture and distribution of fine handbags, which
accounted for approximately 57% of its net sales in fiscal 2001.
Coach makes quarterly offerings of its handbag collections,
featuring classically inspired designs as well as fashion trend
designs. Typically, there are three to four collections per
quarter and four to seven styles per collection, depending on
the concept and opportunity.

Accessories.

Women’s accessories
represented approximately 12% of Coach’s net sales in
fiscal 2001 and consist of wallets, cosmetic cases, key fobs,
belts and hair accessories. The Company recently completed a
comprehensive updating in the design of the small leather goods
collections to coordinate them with its popular handbag
collections. Men’s accessories also represented
approximately 7% of Coach’s net sales in fiscal 2001 and
consist of belts, leather gift boxes and other small leather
goods.

Business Cases.

Business cases represented
approximately 6% of Coach’s net sales in fiscal 2001. The
Company recently expanded this category to include nylon cases
and computer bags.

Luggage and Travel Accessories.

The Coach luggage collection is
comprised of cabin bags, duffels, suitcases, garment bags and a
comprehensive collection of travel accessories. Luggage and
travel accessories represented approximately 4% of Coach’s
net sales in fiscal 2001.

Outerwear, Gloves and Scarves.

Primarily a cold weather category,
the assortment is approximately 64% women’s and contains a
fashion assortment in all three categories. In total, this
category represented approximately 3% of Coach’s net sales
in fiscal 2001.

Personal Planning Products.

A complement to Coach’s
business cases and handbag collections, its personal planning
assortment includes folios, planners and desk agendas in a
variety of leathers and fabrics. The category represented
approximately 2% of Coach’s net sales in fiscal 2001.



Jewelry.

Beginning in November 2001, Coach,
in conjunction with Carolee Designs, Inc., will launch its first
jewelry collection. The collection consists of pure sterling
silver and leather combinations, some with a touch of brass.
Select cuff bracelets will also be offered in a variety of
colors of genuine crocodile.

Watches.

Movado Group, Inc. has been
Coach’s watch licensee since 1998 and has developed a
distinctive collection of watches inspired by both the
women’s and men’s collections. These watches are
manufactured in Switzerland and are branded with the Coach name
and logo.

Footwear.

Jimlar Corporation became the
Company’s footwear licensee in 1999 after a three year
relationship in which Coach previously purchased Coach shoes
manufactured by Jimlar Corporation for sale. The footwear is
developed and manufactured in Italy and is distributed through
more than 200 locations in the U.S. including certain Coach
stores and U.S. department stores. Approximately 81% of the
business is in women’s footwear which coordinates with
Coach handbags and employs fine materials including calf and
suede.

Furniture and Home Furnishings.

Coach furniture was launched in
the Spring of 1999 with Baker Knapp & Tubbs, Inc. as the
licensee. The furniture collection is comprised of a range of
leather and suede sofas, chairs and benches and includes
Coach’s distinctive ebony wood and leather field chairs and
ottomans. The collection is sold through Baker Knapp & Tubbs
showrooms and select dealers across the U.S. The home
furnishings collection was developed for Coach retail stores
with an assortment of leather frames, mirrors, boxes, trays and
pillows.

Office/ Home Office.

Coach office furniture will launch
in the Fall of 2001 with Steelcase as the licensee. Steelcase
and Coach will offer consumers high-end furniture products to
outfit the home office and executive workplace.

Design and Merchandising

Coach’s New York-based design team, led by
its executive creative director, is responsible for
conceptualizing and directing the design of all Coach products.
Designers have access to Coach’s extensive archives of
product designs created over the past 50 years which are a
valuable resource for new product concepts. Coach designers are
also supported by a strong merchandising team that analyzes
sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify
business opportunities that help guide each season’s design
process. Merchandisers also analyze products and edit, add and
delete styles with the objective of profitable sales across
channels. Three product category teams, each comprised of
design, merchandising/product development and manufacturing
specialists, help Coach execute design concepts that are
consistent with the brand’s strategic direction.

Coach’s merchandising team works in close
collaboration with the Company’s licensing partners to
ensure that the licensed products, such as watches, footwear and
furniture, are conceptualized and designed to address the
intended market opportunity and convey the distinctive
perspective and lifestyle associated with the Coach brand. While
the Company’s licensing partners employ their own
designers, Coach oversees the development of their collection
concepts and the design of licensed products. Licensed products
are also subject to Coach’s quality control standards and
it exercises final approval for all new licensed products prior
to their sale.

Marketing

Coach’s marketing strategy is to deliver a
consistent message every time the consumer comes in contact with
the Coach brand through all of its communications and visual
merchandising. The Coach image is created and executed
internally by the creative marketing, visual merchandising and
public relations teams.

In the U.S., Coach spent approximately
$15 million, or 2% of net sales in fiscal 2001, for
national, regional and local advertising, primarily print and
outdoor advertising, in support of its major selling seasons.
Coach catalogs and coach.com also serve as effective brand
communications vehicles, driving store traffic as well as direct
to consumer sales. Coach’s co-branding partners, including
Lexus, Palm and Motorola, have together spent over $34 million
in advertising relating to the Coach brand over the past five
years, and through



their programs have strengthened its brand
cachet. Advertising by the co-branding partners provides
important additional exposure of the Coach brand, although the
revenues generated from the purchase of Coach products by the
co-branding partners are not material to the Coach business. In
fiscal 2001 Coach licensees spent an additional $6 million
as part of an integrated campaign, in which Coach controls
concept, design and execution. In conjunction with promoting a
consistent global image, Coach uses its extensive customer
database and consumer knowledge to target specific products and
communications to specific consumers to efficiently stimulate
sales across all distribution channels.

Coach also engages in a wide range of direct
marketing activities, including catalogs and brochures, targeted
to stimulate sales to consumers in their preferred shopping
venue. As part of Coach’s direct marketing strategy, it
uses its database consisting of approximately seven million U.S.
households. Catalogs are Coach’s principal means of
communication and are sent to selected households to stimulate
consumer purchases and build brand awareness. In addition, the
growing number of visitors to the www.coach.com online store
provides an opportunity to increase the size of this database
and to communicate with consumers to increase on-line and
physical store sales and build brand awareness. Coach’s
on-line store, like its catalogs and brochures, provides a
showcase environment where consumers can browse through a
strategic offering of the Company’s latest styles and
colors.

Coach also has a sophisticated consumer and
market research capability, which helps the Company assess
consumer attitudes and trends and gauge likelihood of success in
the marketplace prior to product introduction.

Channels of Distribution

Direct
Channels

Coach has four different channels that provide it
with immediate, controlled access to consumers: retail stores,
factory stores, e-commerce and direct mail. The direct to
consumer business represented approximately 64% of Coach’s
total sales in fiscal year 2001, with the balance generated
through the indirect channels.

Retail Stores.

The company’s retail stores
establish, reinforce and capitalize on the image of the Coach
brand. Coach operates 121 retail stores in the United States
that are located in upscale regional shopping centers and
metropolitan areas. It operates eight flagship stores, which
offer the broadest assortment of Coach products in
high-visibility locations such as New York, Chicago and San
Francisco. The following table shows the number of Coach retail
stores and their total and average square footage:

Depending on their size and location, the stores
present product lines that include handbags, business cases,
wallets, footwear, watches, travel and related accessories. As
of June 30, 2001 Coach has either remodeled or opened 77
stores to reflect the modern design. These stores represent
approximately 80% of retail store sales volume. By June 2002,
Coach expects to have remodeled all retail stores to reflect its
modern design which creates a distinctive environment that
showcases the various products. Store associates are trained to
maintain high standards of visual presentation, merchandising
and customer service. The result is a complete statement of the
Coach modern American style at the retail level.

Factory Stores.

Coach’s 68 factory stores
serve as an efficient means to sell discontinued and irregular
inventory outside the retail channels. These stores operate
under the Coach Factory name and are



geographically positioned in established centers
that are usually greater than 100 miles from major markets. The
following table shows the number of Coach factory stores and
their total and average square footage:

Coach’s factory store design, visual
presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce
the brand’s image. Prices are discounted from 15% to 50%
below full retail prices. Through these factory stores, Coach
primarily targets value oriented customers who would not
otherwise buy the Coach brand.

e-Commerce.

Coach launched its e-commerce website in early October 1999 in
anticipation of the holiday season. Approximately
5.2 million consumers have visited the site through
June 30, 2001. Coach believes it is positioned to support
strong near-term growth, with a simple, clean user interface
and, based upon Coach direct mail expertise, excellent order
fulfillment capabilities. Like Coach catalogs and brochures, the
on-line store provides a showcase environment where consumers
can browse through a selected offering of the latest styles and
colors.

Direct Mail.

Coach mailed its first Coach
catalog in 1980. In fiscal year 2001, it mailed at least one
Coach catalog to 2.5 million strategically selected
households, primarily from its database. While direct mail sales
comprise a small portion of Coach’s net sales, Coach views
its catalogs as a key communications vehicle for the brand that
also promotes store traffic. As an integral component of its
communications strategy, the graphics, models and photography
are upscale and modern and present the product in an environment
consistent with the Coach brand position. The catalogs highlight
selected products and serve as a reference for customers,
whether ordering through the catalog, making in-store purchases
or purchasing over the Internet.

Indirect Channels

Coach began as a wholesaler to department and
specialty retail stores. This distribution channel remains very
important to its overall consumer reach. The Company has grown
its wholesale business by working closely with its customers,
both domestic and international, to ensure a clear and
consistent product presentation. As part of Coach’s
business transformation, selected shop-within-shop locations in
major department stores are being renovated to achieve the same
modern look and feel of the Coach retail stores. At the end of
fiscal 2001, 24 U.S. department stores were renovated to reflect
the new modern design.

International Wholesale.

Coach’s international
business, which represented approximately 16% of total sales in
fiscal 2001, is generated almost entirely through wholesale
distributors and authorized retailers. Coach has developed
relationships with a select group of distributors who market
Coach products through specialty retailers, department stores,
travel shopping locations, and freestanding Coach stores in 18
countries. Coach’s current network of international
distributors serves markets such as Japan, Australia, the
Caribbean, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. Coach has created
image enhancing environments in these locations to increase
brand appeal and stimulate growth. Within the international
arena, the primary focus continues to be the Japanese consumer.
Coach targets this consumer in Japan and in areas with
significant levels of Japanese tourism. The importance of
Japanese consumers is illustrated by a comparison of consumption
levels: per capita spending on handbags in Japan is
substantially greater than in the U.S. Coach’s more
significant international wholesale customers include Dickson
Concepts, Inc., Duty Free Shops, J. Osawa, Mitsukoshi and
Unisia.



In June 2001, Coach strengthened its Japanese
focus by forming CJI. This entity is a joint venture with
Sumitomo Corporation and will manage the Coach business in
Japan. CJI plans to open additional locations within existing
major retailers, enter new department store relationships and
open freestanding retail locations. On July 31, 2001, CJI
acquired PDC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsukoshi. With this
acquisition CJI will manage all locations currently operated by
Mitsukoshi, who will remain a key retailer for the brand.

The following table shows the number of
international retail stores, international department store
locations and other international locations at which Coach
products are sold:

U.S.
Wholesale.

Coach’s products
are currently sold in the U.S. at approximately 1,400 wholesale
locations. This channel represented approximately 13% of total
sales in fiscal 2001. Recognizing the continued importance of
U.S. department and specialty stores as a distribution channel
for premier accessories, Coach is strengthening its longstanding
relationships with its key customers through its products and
styles and Coach’s renovation program. This channel offers
access to Coach customers who prefer shopping at department and
specialty stores or who live in geographic areas that are not
large enough to support a Coach retail store. The company’s
more significant U.S. wholesale customers include Federated
(including Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, Rich’s/
Lazarus, Burdine’s, and Bon Marche), May Co. (including
Lord & Taylor, Foley’s, Hecht’s,
Kaufman’s, Robinson’s/ May, Famous Barr, Filene’s
and Meier & Frank), Dillard’s, Marshall Fields, Saks
Inc., El Portal and Nordstrom.

Business to Business.

As part of the indirect channel of
distribution, Coach sells some of its products in selected
military locations and through corporate incentive and
gift-giving programs.

Licensing.

In
the Company’s licensing relationships, Coach takes an
active role in the design process and controls the marketing and
distribution of products under the Coach brand. The current
licensing relationships are as follows:

Products made under license are, in most cases,
sold through all of the channels listed above and, with
Coach’s approval, these licensees have the right to
distribute Coach brand products selectively through several
other channels: shoes in department store shoe salons, furniture
through Baker’s own showrooms, and watches in jewelry
stores. These venues provide additional, yet controlled,
exposure of the Coach brand. Coach’s licensing partners pay
the Company royalties on their sales of Coach branded products.
However, such royalties currently comprise less than 1% of Coach
revenues and are not material to the Coach business. The
licensing agreements generally give Coach the right to terminate
the license if specified sales targets are not achieved.

Manufacturing

Coach has refined its production capabilities in
coordination with the repositioning of its brand. By shifting
its production from owned domestic facilities to independent
manufacturers in lower-cost markets, it can support a broader
mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new,
more fashion-oriented styles. During fiscal year 2001,
approximately 68% of Coach’s sales were generated from
products introduced within the fiscal year. At the same time,
the Company helps manage total inventory and limit its exposure
to



excess and obsolete inventory by designating a
large number of the new styles as “limited editions”
that are planned to be discontinued and replaced with fresh new
products.

Coach has developed a flexible model that meets
shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer
preferences. It uses three main sources to make Coach products:
outsourcing with skilled partners, internal manufacturing and
production by its licensing partners. All product sources must
achieve and maintain Coach’s high quality standards which
are an integral part of the Coach identity. The Company monitors
compliance with the quality control standards through on-site
quality inspections at all Coach-operated or independent
manufacturing facilities. One of Coach’s keys to success
lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials. Coach has
long-standing relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and
hardware. As it has shifted a significant portion of its
production to external sources, Coach still insists that these
same raw materials are used in all of its products, wherever
they are made.

Approximately 87% of Coach’s fiscal year
2001 non-licensed product requirements were supplied by
independent manufacturers, measured as a percentage of total
units produced. Coach buys independently manufactured products
from a variety of countries including China, Costa Rica, Mexico,
India, Italy, Spain, Hungary and Turkey. It operates a European
Sourcing and Product Development organization based in Florence,
Italy which works closely with the New York-based design team.
This broad-based multi-country manufacturing strategy is
designed to optimize the mix of cost, lead times and
construction capabilities. Coach carefully balances its
commitments to a limited number of “better brand”
partners with demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable
delivery. No one vendor provides more than 20% of the
Company’s total requirements. Before partnering with a
vendor, Coach evaluates each facility by conducting a quality
and business practice standards audit. Periodic evaluations of
existing, previously approved facilities are conducted on a
random basis. The Company believes that all of its manufacturing
partners are in compliance with Coach integrity standards. Coach
currently operates one manufacturing facility in leased
premises. In fiscal year 2001, this 66,000 square foot facility
in Lares, Puerto Rico produced about 11% of Coach’s
requirements.

As part of the strategy to shift production to
independent manufacturers in lower-cost markets, Coach ceased
operations at a Company facility, located in Medley, Florida, in
October 2000. In fiscal year 2001, this 107,000 square foot
facility contributed approximately 2% of production.

Distribution

In July 1999 Coach consolidated its worldwide
warehousing, distribution and repair functions into one location
in Jacksonville, Florida. This highly automated, computerized,
560,000 square foot facility uses a bar code scanning warehouse
management system. Coach’s distribution center employees
use handheld optical scanners to read product bar codes which
allows the Company to more accurately process and pack orders,
track shipments, manage inventory and generally provide better
service to its customers. Coach’s products are primarily
shipped via United Parcel Service (“UPS”) and common
carriers to Coach retail stores and wholesale customers and via
UPS direct to consumers.

The average order processing time is 2 to
3 days. During Coach’s peak season in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company shipped approximately
97% of all orders complete. Because of its 20 years of
experience shipping orders to individual catalog customers,
Coach believes it is well positioned to support the order
fulfillment requirements of its growing business, including
business generated through the website.

Management Information Systems

The foundation of Coach’s information
systems is its Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”)
system. Implemented in 1997, this fully integrated system
supports all aspects of finance and accounting, procurement,
inventory control, sales and store replenishment, resulting in
increased efficiencies, improved inventory control and a better
understanding of consumer demand. The system functions as a
central repository for all of Coach’s transactional
information, resulting in increased efficiencies and greater
inventory control. This system is fully scalable to accommodate
rapid growth.



Complementing its ERP system are several other
newly-implemented system solutions, each of which, Coach
believes, is well-suited for its needs. The data warehouse
system summarizes the transaction information and provides a
single platform for all management reporting. The supply chain
management system supports corporate sales and inventory
functions, creating a monthly demand plan and reconciling
production/procurement with financial plans. Product fulfillment
is facilitated by Coach’s highly automated warehouse
management system and electronic data interchange system, while
the unique requirements of Coach’s catalog and Internet
businesses are supported by the Company’s custom direct
sales system. Finally, the point-of-sale system supports all
in-store transactions, distributes management reporting to each
store, and collects sales and payroll information on a daily
basis. This daily collection of store sales and inventory
information results in early identification of business trends
and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory
replenishment. All complementary systems are integrated with the
central ERP system.

Trademarks and Patents

Coach owns all of the material trademark rights
used in connection with the production, marketing and
distribution of all of its products, both in the U.S. and in
other countries in which the products are principally sold. The
Company owns and maintains worldwide registrations for
trademarks in all relevant classes of products in each of the
countries in which Coach products are sold. Its major trademarks
include

Coach, Coach and lozenge design

and

Coach and
tag design

and it has applications pending for a proprietary

“C” signature fabric design

. Coach is not
dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent
although Coach believes that the Coach name is important for its
business. In addition, several of Coach’s products are
covered by design patents or patent applications. Coach
aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues
infringers both domestically and internationally. It also
pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through
leads generated internally, as well as through its network of
investigators, the Coach hotline and business partners around
the world.

Coach’s trademarks in the United States will
remain in existence for as long as Coach continues to use and
renew them on their expiration date. Coach has no material
patents.

Employees

As of June 30, 2001, Coach employed
approximately 2,700 people, approximately 60 of which were
covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of the total,
approximately 1,400 are engaged in retail selling and
administration positions and approximately 900 are engaged in
manufacturing, sourcing or distribution functions. The remaining
employees are engaged in other aspects of the Coach business.
Coach believes that its relations with its employees are good,
and it has never encountered a strike or significant work
stoppage.

Government Regulation

Many of Coach’s imported products are
subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas that
may limit the quantity of products that the company may import
into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such
products. Coach has not been restricted by quotas in the
operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised
a material portion of the total cost of a majority of its
products. In addition, Coach is subject to foreign governmental
regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation
against certain prohibited foreign practices, with respect to
its product sourcing and international sales operations.

RISK FACTORS

You should consider carefully all of the
information set forth or incorporated by reference in this
document and, in particular, the following risk factors
associated with (1) the Business of Coach and
(2) forward-looking information in this document. Please
see “Special Note on Forward-Looking
Information”.

If Coach is unable to successfully
implement its growth strategies or manage its growing business,
its future operating results will suffer.



In fiscal years 1998 and 1999 Coach experienced a
decline in sales as compared to prior years of 3.4% and 2.8%,
respectively. In fiscal years 1997 through 1999 it also
experienced reduced profitability. In response to these declines
Coach implemented a number of strategic initiatives to increase
demand for its products and Coach recently accelerated these
initiatives. The success of each of these initiatives, alone or
collectively, will depend on various factors, including the
appeal of Coach’s new designs, products and retail
presentation to consumers, competitive conditions and domestic
and international economic conditions. If Coach is unsuccessful
at implementing some or all of its strategies or initiatives,
its future operating results may be adversely affected.

Successful implementation of Coach’s
strategies and initiatives will require it to manage its growth.
To manage growth effectively, Coach will need to continue to
increase its outsourced manufacturing while maintaining strict
quality control. Coach will also need to continue to improve its
operating systems to respond to any increased demand. It could
suffer a loss of consumer goodwill and a decline in sales if its
products do not continue to meet its quality control standards
or if it is unable to adequately respond to increases in
consumer demand for its products.

Coach’s inability to respond to
changes in consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely
manner could adversely affect its sales.

Coach’s success depends on its ability to
identify, originate and define product and fashion trends as
well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer
demands in a timely manner. Its products must appeal to a broad
range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with
certainty and are subject to rapid change. Coach cannot assure
that it will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or
meet changing consumer demands in the future.

If Coach misjudges the demand for its
products it may incur increased costs due to excess
inventories.

If Coach misjudges the market for its products it
may be faced with significant excess inventories for some
products and missed opportunities for other products. In
addition, because Coach places orders for products with its
manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’
orders, it could experience higher excess inventories if
wholesale customers order fewer products than Coach anticipated.

Competition in the markets in which Coach
operates is intense and its competitors may develop products
more popular with consumers.

Coach faces intense competition in the product
lines and markets in which it operates. Coach’s products
compete with other brands of products within their product
category and with private label products sold by retailers,
including some of Coach’s wholesale customers. In its
wholesale business, Coach competes with numerous manufacturers,
importers and distributors of handbags, accessories and other
products for the limited space available for the display of
these products to the consumer. Moreover, the general
availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy
access to the markets in which Coach operates, which may
increase the number of competitors and adversely affect its
competitive position and business. Some of Coach’s
competitors have achieved significant recognition for their
brand names or have substantially greater financial,
distribution, marketing and other resources than it has.

A downturn in the economy may affect
consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items which could
adversely affect Coach’s sales.

Many factors affect the level of consumer
spending in the handbag and luxury accessories industry,
including, among others, general business conditions, interest
rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and
consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Consumer
purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as Coach products,
tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable
income is lower. A downturn in the economies in which Coach
sells its products, such as the economic downturn in Asia during
1997, may adversely affect Coach’s sales.



If Coach loses key management or design
personnel or is unable to attract and retain the talent required
for its business, its operating results could
suffer.

Coach’s performance depends largely on the
efforts and abilities of its senior management and design teams.
These executives and employees have substantial experience and
expertise in Coach’s business and have made significant
contributions to its growth and success. Coach does not have
employment agreements with any of its key executives or design
personnel. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of
these individuals could have an adverse effect on Coach’s
business. As the business grows, Coach will need to attract and
retain additional qualified personnel and develop, train and
manage an increasing number of management-level, sales and other
employees. Coach cannot assure you that it will be able to
attract and retain personnel as needed in the future.

Coach’s operating results are subject
to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely
affect the market price of its common stock.

Because Coach products are frequently given as
gifts, Coach has experienced, and expects to continue to
experience, substantial seasonal fluctuations in its sales and
operating results. Over the past two fiscal years approximately
35% of Coach’s annual sales and between 61% and 73% of its
operating income were recognized in the second fiscal quarter,
which includes the holiday months of November and December. In
anticipation of increased sales activity during the second
quarter, Coach incurs significant additional expenses. If, for
any reason, Coach miscalculates the demand for its products
during November and December, it could have significant excess
inventory, which would have an adverse effect on its financial
performance. In addition, because a substantial portion of
Coach’s operating income is derived from second quarter
sales, a significant shortfall in expected second quarter sales
could have an adverse impact on the annual operating results.
Coach has sometimes experienced and may continue to experience
net losses in any or all of its first, third or fourth fiscal
quarters.

Coach’s quarterly results of operations may
also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other
factors, including, among other things:

As a result of these seasonal and quarterly
fluctuations, Coach believes that comparisons of its sales and
operating results between different quarters within a single
fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful and that these
comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of its future
performance. Any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that Coach
reports in the future may not match the expectations of market
analysts and investors. This could cause the trading price of
Coach’s common stock to fluctuate significantly.

Coach’s gross profit may decrease if
it becomes unable to obtain its products from, or sell its
products in other countries due to adverse international events
that are beyond its control.

In order to lower its sourcing costs and increase
its gross profit, Coach has shifted its production to
independent non-U.S. manufacturers in lower-cost markets.
Coach’s international manufacturers are subject to many
risks, including foreign governmental regulations, political
unrest, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in local
economic conditions and trade issues. These factors, among
others, could influence the ability of these independent
manufacturers to make or export Coach products cost-effectively
or at all or to procure some of the materials used in these
products. The violation of labor or other laws by any of
Coach’s independent manufacturers, or the divergence of an
independent manufacturer’s labor practices from those



generally accepted as ethical by Coach or others
in the U.S., could damage Coach’s reputation and force it
to locate alternative manufacturing sources. Currency exchange
rate fluctuations could also make raw materials more expensive
for these independent manufacturers, and they could pass these
increased costs along to Coach, resulting in higher costs and
decreased margins for its products. If any of these factors were
to render a particular country undesirable or impractical as a
source of supply, there could be an adverse effect on
Coach’s business, including its gross profit.

Coach’s failure to continue and increase
sales of its products in international markets could adversely
affect its gross profit. International sales are subject to many
risks, including foreign governmental regulations, foreign
consumer preferences, political unrest, disruptions or delays in
shipments to other nations and changes in local economic
conditions. These factors, among others, could influence
Coach’s ability to sell products successfully in
international markets. Coach generally purchases raw materials
and products from international manufacturers in U.S. dollars
and sells these products in the U.S. and to its international
wholesale customers in U.S. dollars. However, Coach’s
international wholesale customers sell Coach products in the
relevant local currencies, and currency exchange rate
fluctuations could adversely affect the retail prices of the
products and result in decreased international consumer demand.

Coach’s trademark and other
proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of
others and it may be inhibited from selling some of its
products. If Coach is unable to protect its trademarks and other
proprietary rights, others may sell imitation brand
products.

Coach believes that its registered and common law
trademarks and design patents are important to its ability to
create and sustain demand for Coach products. Coach cannot
assure you that it will not encounter trademark, patent or trade
dress disputes in the future as it expands its product line and
the geographic scope of its marketing. Coach also cannot assure
that the actions taken by it to establish and protect its
trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to
prevent imitation of its products or infringement of its
trademarks and proprietary rights by others. The laws of some
foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same
extent as do the laws of the U.S. and it may be more difficult
for Coach to successfully challenge the use of its proprietary
rights by other parties in these countries.

Provisions in Coach’s charter and
bylaws and Maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of
Coach by a third party.

Coach’s charter and bylaws and Maryland law
contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party
to acquire Coach without the consent of Coach’s Board of
Directors. Coach’s charter permits its Board of Directors,
without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase
or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the
number of shares of stock of any class or series that Coach has
the authority to issue. In addition, Coach’s Board of
Directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of
common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences,
rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares.
Although Coach’s Board of Directors has no intention to do
so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred
stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a transaction or a change in control that might
involve a premium price for Coach’s common stock or
otherwise be in the best interest of Coach’s stockholders.

On May 3, 2001 Coach declared a “poison
pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional
common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of
Coach’s common stock.

Subject to limited exceptions, these rights may
be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10% or
more of the Company’s common stock or announces a tender
offer for 10% or more of the common stock on terms not approved
by the Coach Board of Directors. In this event, each right would
entitle the holder of each share of Coach’s common stock to
buy one additional common share of the Company at an exercise
price far below the then-current market price. Subject to
certain exceptions, Coach’s Board of Directors will be
entitled to redeem the rights at $0.001 per right at any time
before the close of business on the tenth day following either
the public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of
Coach’s Board of Directors becomes aware that, a person has
acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. The



Company is currently aware of two institutional
shareholders whose common stock holdings exceed the 10%
threshold established by the rights plan. Each of these holders
has been given permission to increase its ownership in the
company to a maximum of 15%, subject to certain exceptions,
before triggering the provision of the rights plan.

Coach’s bylaws can only be amended by
Coach’s Board of Directors. Coach’s bylaws also
provide that nominations of persons for election to Coach’s
Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered
at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the
meeting, by Coach’s Board of Directors or by a stockholder
who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the
advance notice procedures of Coach’s bylaws. Also, under
Maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of
equity securities, between Coach and any person who beneficially
owns 10% or more of Coach’s common stock or an affiliate of
such person are prohibited for a five-year period unless
exempted in accordance with the statute. After this period, a
combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority
stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the
business combination is exempted by Coach’s Board of
Directors. Coach’s Board has exempted any business
combination with us or any of our affiliates from the five-year
prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements.

These and other provisions of Maryland law or
Coach’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in
control that might involve a premium price for Coach’s
common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of
Coach’s stockholders.

Properties

The following table sets forth the location, use
and size of Coach’s manufacturing, distribution and
corporate facilities as of June 30, 2001, all of which are
leased. The leases expire at various times through 2015, subject
to renewal options.

Coach also occupies 121 retail and 68 factory
leased retail stores located in the United States and 2 retail
locations in the United Kingdom. Coach considers these
properties to be in good condition generally and believes that
its facilities are adequate for its operations and provide
sufficient capacity to meet its anticipated requirements.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

Coach is involved in various routine legal
proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the
ordinary course of its business. In the ordinary course of
business, the Company is involved in the policing of its
intellectual property rights. As part of its policing program,
from time to time, Coach files lawsuits in the U.S. and abroad
alleging acts of trademark counterfeiting, trademark
infringement, patent infringement, trade dress infringement,
trademark dilution and/or state or foreign law claims. At any
given point in time, Coach may have one or more of such actions
pending. These actions often result in seizure of counterfeit
merchandise and/or out of court settlements with defendants.
From time to time, defendants will raise as affirmative defenses
or as counterclaims the invalidity or unenforcability of certain
of Coach’s intellectual properties. Coach believes that the
outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will
not have a material adverse effect on the Coach business or
financial condition.

Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

The following discussion of Coach’s
financial condition and results of operations should be read
together with Coach’s financial statements and notes to
those statements included elsewhere in this document.

Overview

Coach was founded in 1941 and was acquired by the
Sara Lee Corporation (“Sara Lee”) in July 1985. In
October 2000, Coach was listed on the New York Stock Exchange
and sold 8.5 million shares of stock in an initial public
offering. In April 2001, Sara Lee ended its ownership with a
distribution of its remaining shares in Coach via an exchange
offer. That exchange offer allowed Sara Lee stockholders to
exchange Sara Lee common stock and options for Coach common
shares and options.

Coach is a designer, producer and marketer of
high-quality, modern American classic accessories. Coach’s
primary product offerings include handbags, women’s and
men’s accessories, business cases, luggage and travel
accessories, personal planning products, leather outerwear,
gloves and scarves.

Coach generates revenue by selling its products
directly to consumers and indirectly through wholesale customers
and by licensing its brand name to select manufacturers. Direct
to consumer sales consist of sales of Coach products through its
121 Company-operated U.S. retail stores, its direct mail
catalogs, its e-commerce website and its 68 Company-operated
U.S. factory stores. Indirect sales consist of sales of Coach
products to



approximately 1,400 department store and
specialty retailer locations in the U.S., and approximately 175
international department store, retail store and duty free shop
locations in 18 countries. In the U.S. Coach generates
additional wholesale sales through business-to-business
programs, in which companies purchase Coach products to use as
gifts or incentive rewards. Licensing revenues consist of
royalties paid to Coach under licensing arrangements with select
manufacturers for the sale of Coach branded watches, footwear
and furniture.

Coach’s cost of sales consists of the costs
associated with manufacturing its products. Coach’s gross
profit is dependent upon a variety of factors and may fluctuate
from quarter to quarter. These factors include changes in the
mix of products it sells, fluctuations in cost of materials and
changes in the relative sales mix among its distribution
channels. Direct to consumer sales generally generate higher
gross margins than indirect sales, because Coach earns both the
wholesale margin and the retail margin on these sales.
International sales generate higher gross margins than U.S.
wholesale sales because international retail prices are
generally higher.

Selling, general and administrative expenses are
comprised of four categories of expenses: selling; advertising,
marketing and design; distribution and customer service; and
administration and information services. Selling expenses are
comprised of store employee compensation, store occupancy costs,
store supply costs, wholesale account administration
compensation, international wholesale account rebates and mail
order costs. Advertising, marketing and design expenses include
employee compensation, media space and production, advertising
agency fees, new product design costs as well as public
relations and market research expenses. Distribution and
customer services expenses are comprised of warehousing, order
fulfillment, shipping and handling, customer service and bag
repair costs. Administration and information services expenses
are comprised of compensation costs for the information systems,
executive, finance, human resources and legal departments as
well as consulting and software expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses are affected by the number of stores
Coach operates in any fiscal period and the relative proportions
of retail and wholesale sales. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increase as Coach operates more stores,
although an increase in the number of stores generally enables
it to spread the fixed portion of its selling, general and
administrative expenses over a larger sales base.

As part of the transformation of Coach’s
business, Coach consolidated its distribution operations into
its Jacksonville, Florida distribution facility in fiscal year
1999 to reduce costs and provide capacity for future unit
growth. In addition, Coach significantly reduced manufacturing
operations in its Carlstadt, New Jersey facility and transferred
production to lower cost independent manufacturers, primarily
outside the U.S. Coach continues to manufacture prototypes at
the Carlstadt facility. The total cost of the reorganization of
Coach’s distribution and manufacturing operations in fiscal
year 1999 was $7.1 million, comprised of $5.7 million
associated with the Carlstadt shutdown, $1.1 million
associated with manufacturing reductions in Medley, Florida and
$0.3 million associated with manufacturing reductions in
Florence, Italy.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2001,
management of Coach committed to and announced a plan to cease
production at the Medley, Florida manufacturing facility in
October 2000. This reorganization involved the termination of
362 manufacturing, warehousing and management employees at the
Medley facility. These actions are intended to reduce costs by
the resulting transfer of production to lower cost third-party
manufacturers. The total cost of the reorganization of Medley in
fiscal 2001 was $4.6 million, comprised of $3.1 million for
worker separation costs, $0.8 million for lease termination
costs, and $0.6 million for the write down of long-lived assets
to their net realizable values.

Coach’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday
closest to June 30. Fiscal year 1999 consisted of
53 weeks and fiscal years 2000 and 2001 each consisted of
52 weeks.

Results of Operations

The following is a discussion of the results of
operations for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, and fiscal
2000 compared to fiscal 1999 along with a discussion of the
changes in financial condition during fiscal 2001.



This Management’s Discussion and Analysis
should be read in conjunction with Coach’s Consolidated
Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes thereto.

Net sales by business segment for fiscal 2001

Fiscal 2001
Compared to Fiscal 2000

Net Sales

Net sales increased by 12.2% to
$616.1 million in fiscal 2001 from $548.9 million in
fiscal 2000. These results reflect increased volume in both the
direct to consumer and indirect channels.

Direct.

Net
sales increased 11.3% to $391.8 million in fiscal 2001 from
$352.0 million in fiscal 2000. The increase was primarily
due to new store openings, store renovations, store expansions
and comparable stores sales growth. Comparable store sales
growth for retail stores and factory stores open for one full
year was 2.1% and 4.3%, respectively. Since the end of fiscal
2000, Coach has opened 15 new retail stores and five new factory
stores. In addition, 28 retail stores and five factory
stores were remodeled, while three retail stores and one factory
store were expanded. No stores were closed during fiscal 2001.

Indirect.

Net
sales attributable to United States and international wholesale
shipments increased 13.9% to $224.3 million in fiscal 2001
from $196.9 million in fiscal 2000. The increase was
primarily due to strong gains in the international wholesale
channel, highlighted by continued double-digit increases in
comparable location sales to Japanese consumers worldwide and
increased demand for new products. Licensing revenue increased
23.6% to $2.2 million in fiscal 2001 from $1.8 million
in fiscal 2000 due primarily to expanded distribution of
licensed footwear product.

Gross Profit

Gross profit increased 20.9% to
$397.6 million in fiscal 2001 from $328.8 million in
fiscal 2000. Gross margin increased approximately 460 basis
points to 64.5% in fiscal 2001 from 59.9% in fiscal 2000. This
improvement was driven by a shift in product mix, reflecting the
continued diversification into non-leather fabrications with new
and successful mixed-material collections. In addition, gross
margin benefited from the continuing impact of sourcing cost
reductions as well as channel mix, as the international channel
continued to expand as a percentage of sales.

The following chart illustrates the gross margin
performance we have experienced over the last eight quarters:

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased 6.8% to $291.3 million in fiscal 2001 from
$272.8 million in fiscal 2000. Selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased to 47.3% as a percentage of
net sales versus 49.7% in fiscal 2000.

Selling expenses increased by 14.8% to
$178.3 million, or 28.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from
$155.4 million, or 28.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. The
dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to



$16.3 million of operating costs associated
with new retail and factory stores; increased variable costs for
comparable store sales; store remodels; costs to support the
additional stores; and store sales promotions to enhance sales.
The remaining selling expense increase was caused primarily by
volume-related costs in our indirect sales channels.

Advertising, marketing, and design expenses
increased by 4.0% to $52.2 million, or 8.5% of net sales, in
fiscal 2001 from $50.2 million, or 9.1% of net sales, in
fiscal 2000. The dollar increase in these expenses was primarily
due to increased staffing expenses of $1.0 million and
increased advertising expenses of $0.6 million.

Distribution and customer service expenses
increased slightly to $25.8 million, or 4.2% of net sales,
in fiscal 2001 from $25.3 million, or 4.6% of net sales, in
fiscal 2000. The dollar increase in these expenses was due to
higher sales volumes, partially offset by efficiency gains at
our distribution and customer service facility.

Administrative expenses decreased to
$35.0 million, or 5.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from
$41.9 million, or 7.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. The
decrease in these expenses was due to lower fringe benefit costs
and lower performance based compensation expenses, partially
offset by higher occupancy costs associated with the lease
renewal of our New York City corporate headquarters location and
incremental expenses incurred to support new corporate
governance activities relating to the Company becoming publicly
owned.

Reorganization Costs

In the first fiscal quarter of 2001 management of
Coach committed to and announced a plan to cease production at
the Medley, Florida manufacturing facility in October 2000. This
reorganization involved the termination of 362 manufacturing,
warehousing and management employees at the Medley facility.
These actions are intended to reduce costs by the resulting
transfer of production to lower cost third-party manufacturers.
Coach achieved cost savings of $2.7 million in fiscal 2001
and expects $4.5 million in annual savings in future years
from these actions. Coach recorded a reorganization cost of
$5.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2001. In
the second half of fiscal year 2001, this charge was reduced to
$4.6 million. This was due primarily to the complete
disposition of the fixed assets, in which the proceeds exceeded
original estimates by management. This reorganization cost
includes $3.1 million for worker separation costs,
$0.8 million for lease termination costs and
$0.6 million for the write down of long-lived assets to net
realizable value. By June 30, 2001, production ceased at
the Medley facility, disposition of the fixed assets had been
accomplished and the termination of the 362 employees had been
completed.

Operating Income

Operating income increased 81.5% to
$101.7 million from $56.0 million in fiscal 2000. This
increase resulted from higher sales and improved gross margins,
partially offset by an increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses. Before the impact of reorganization
costs, operating income increased 89.7% to $106.3 million,
or 17.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $56.0 million,
or 10.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2000.

Interest Expense

Net interest expense increased 483% to
$2.3 million, or 0.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from
$0.4 million or 0.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. The
increase was due to interest expense on the note payable to an
affiliate of Sara Lee that Coach assumed in October 2000 as part
of the initial public offering and interest expense on
borrowings on its new Fleet National Bank facility
(“Fleet” facility), which replaced the facility
previously provided by Sara Lee. There was no interest expense
incurred on the facility provided by Sara Lee in the prior year.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate increased to 35.6% in
fiscal 2001 from 30.6% in fiscal 2000. This increase was caused
by a lower percentage of income in fiscal 2001 attributable to
Company-owned offshore manufacturing, which is taxed at lower
rates.



Net Income

Net income increased 65.9% to $64.0 million
from $38.6 million in fiscal 2000. This increase was the
result of increased operating income partially offset by a
higher provision for income taxes and increased interest
expense. Before the impact of reorganization costs, net of
related tax effect, net income increased 73.5% to
$67.0 million, or 10.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from
$38.6 million, or 7.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2000.

Earnings Per Share

Diluted net income per share was $1.52 in fiscal
2001. This reflects a weighted average of the shares outstanding
before and after the public offering of common stock in October
2000. If the common shares sold in the October 2000 initial
public offering had been outstanding for the entire year, net
income before the impact of reorganization costs per diluted
share would have been $1.50. Prior year diluted net income per
share was $1.10 since only the shares owned by Sara Lee are used
in the calculation. Comparable net earnings per share in fiscal
2000 would have been $0.89 if the common shares sold in the
October 2000 public offering had been outstanding for the prior
period.

Fiscal 2000
Compared to Fiscal 1999

Net Sales

Net sales increased by 8.1% to
$548.9 million in fiscal 2000 from $507.8 million during
fiscal 1999. These results reflect increased volume in the
indirect channels and, to a lesser extent, in the direct channel.

Direct.

Net
sales increased 4.6% to $352.0 million in fiscal 2000 from
$336.5 million during fiscal 1999. This sales growth was
primarily attributable to comparable store sales growth of 7.5%
and the opening of eight new retail stores and two new factory
stores. Comparable store sales growth for retail stores and
factory stores open for one full year was 11.7% and 3.4%,
respectively. Coach renovated 23 retail stores during fiscal
2000, which generated incremental sales growth after their
renovation. This growth was partially offset by a
$7.3 million reduction of warehouse sales events and
employee sales, the closing of three retail stores and one
factory store and the temporary closure of some stores for
renovations.

Indirect.

Net
sales increased 14.9% to $196.9 million in fiscal 2000 from
$171.3 million during fiscal 1999. This increase resulted
from increased demand for Coach’s new product assortments
and the economic recovery in Asia. Licensing revenue increased
138% to $1.8 million in fiscal 2000. This increase reflects
the full-year impact of the Coach footwear licensing arrangement
and the introduction of the furniture licensing arrangement in
the Spring of 1999.

Gross Profit

Gross profit increased 16.8% to
$328.8 million in fiscal 2000 from $281.6 million in fiscal
1999. Gross margin increased to 59.9% in fiscal 2000 from 55.4%
in fiscal 1999. This increase in gross margin was primarily due
to manufacturing and sourcing-cost reductions realized during
fiscal 2000 from Coach’s reorganization that commenced in
1999, as well as increased sales at Coach’s retail stores
and increased shipments to international distributors. In fiscal
2000, approximately 74% of Coach’s total units produced
were manufactured by independent manufacturers, compared to
approximately 48% in fiscal 1999. Gross profit also increased as
a result of the reduction of warehouse sales events and the
reduction in employee sales, which have lower gross margins.

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased 7.0% to $272.8 million in fiscal 2000 from
$255.0 million in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of net
sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 49.7%,
compared to 50.2% in fiscal 1999. Selling, general and
administrative expenses in fiscal 2000 increased in dollars but
decreased as a percentage of net sales.



Selling expenses increased by $3.3 million
in fiscal 2000 primarily because of $2.5 million in
operating costs associated with eight new retail stores, two new
factory stores and six store expansions.

Advertising, marketing and design costs increased
by $6.5 million in fiscal 2000 primarily as a result of
increased advertising expenses of $3.2 million and increased
staffing expenses of $2.2 million.

Distribution and customer service costs declined
by $1.4 million, reflecting the first full year impact of
the consolidation of all of Coach’s distribution operations
into its Jacksonville, Florida facility.

Administrative expenses increased by
$9.3 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in administrative
expenses was the result of $11.3 million of incremental
performance-based compensation versus fiscal 1999 due to
improvements in operating income. Performance-based compensation
is calculated utilizing preset financial targets. The
compensation increase was partially offset by a
$2.0 million reduction in salaries and consulting fees.

Operating Income

Operating income increased 187.2% to
$56.0 million in fiscal 2000 from $19.5 million in
fiscal 1999. Before the impact of reorganization costs in fiscal
1999, operating income increased 110.5% to $56.0 million in
fiscal 2000 from $26.6 million in fiscal 1999. This
increase resulted from the overall increase in sales and
improved gross margin in fiscal 2000, which was partially offset
by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Income Taxes

Coach’s effective tax rate increased to
30.6% in fiscal 2000 from 12.3% during fiscal 1999, due to a
lower percentage of income attributable to Company-owned
offshore manufacturing that is taxed at lower rates.

Net Income

Net income increased 131.1% to $38.6 million
in fiscal 2000 from $16.7 million in fiscal 1999. This increase
was the result of increased operating income partially offset by
a higher provision for income taxes.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating and investing
activities was $93.3 million in fiscal 2001, 51.4% higher
than the $61.6 million provided in fiscal 2000. The
$31.7 million year-to-year increase in cash provided from
operating activities was primarily the result of higher earnings.

Capital expenditures amounted to
$31.9 million in fiscal 2001, compared to
$26.1 million in fiscal 2000 and in both periods related
primarily to new and renovated retail stores. Our future capital
expenditures will depend on the timing and rate of expansion of
our businesses, new store openings, store renovations and
international expansion opportunities.

On July 2, 2000, the Company entered into a
revolving credit facility with Sara Lee under which Coach could
borrow up to $75 million from Sara Lee. This facility was
paid off and terminated on February 27, 2001.

To provide funding for working capital for
operations and general corporate purposes, on February 27,
2001, Coach, certain lenders and Fleet National Bank, as primary
lender and administrative agent, entered into a
$100 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
Indebtedness under this revolving credit facility bears interest
calculated, at Coach’s option, at either:

•

a rate of LIBOR plus 70 to 150 basis points based
	on a rolling four-quarter fixed-charge coverage grid; or

•

the prime rate announced by Fleet.



The initial LIBOR margin under the facility was
125 basis points. As of May 2001, the LIBOR margin was reduced
to 100 basis points, reflecting an improvement in our
fixed-charge coverage ratio, calculated quarterly in accordance
with the pricing grid. Under this revolving credit facility,
Coach will pay a commitment fee of 20 to 35 basis points based
on any unused amounts, based on the same fixed-charge coverage
grid. The initial commitment fee was 30 basis points. As of
May 2001, the commitment fee was reduced to 25 basis
points. This credit facility may be prepaid without penalty or
premium.

The Fleet facility contains various covenants and
customary events of default, including:

The Company has been in compliance with all
covenants of the Fleet facility since its inception.

The Company opened 15 new retail stores and five
factory stores in fiscal year 2001. The Company expects to
complete its store renovations program in fiscal 2002. The
Company expects that fiscal 2002 capital expenditures for new
retail stores will be approximately $16 million and that
capital expenditures for store renovations will be approximately
$11 million. The Company intends to finance these
investments from internally generated cash flow or by using
funds from its revolving credit facility.

The Company experiences significant seasonal
variations in working capital requirements. During the first
fiscal quarter the Company builds up inventory for the holiday
selling season, opens new retail stores and generates higher
levels of trade receivables. In the second fiscal quarter
working capital requirements are reduced substantially as the
Company generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts
receivable. In fiscal 2001, Coach purchased approximately
$222 million of inventory, which was funded by operating
cash flow and by borrowings under its revolving credit
facilities. During fiscal 2001 the peak borrowings under the
Sara Lee and Fleet revolving credit facilities were
$37.7 million and $31.0 million, respectively. As of
June 30, 2001, the outstanding borrowings under the Fleet
facility were $7.7 million. Coach believes that its
operating cash flow, together with the revolving credit
facility, will provide sufficient capital to fund its operations
for the foreseeable future.

Currently, Sara Lee is a guarantor or a party to
many of the Company’s store leases. The Company has agreed
to make efforts to remove Sara Lee from all of its existing
leases and Sara Lee is not a guarantor or a party to any new or
renewed leases. The Company has obtained a letter of credit for
the benefit of Sara Lee in an amount approximately equal to the
annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to Coach
by Sara Lee but for which Sara Lee retains contingent liability.
The Company is required to maintain the letter of credit until
the annual minimum rental payments under the relevant leases are
less than $2.0 million. The initial letter of credit has a
face amount of $20.6 million and the Company expects this
amount to decrease annually as its guaranteed obligations are
reduced. The Company expects that it will be required to
maintain the letter of credit for at least 10 years.

Seasonality

Because its products are frequently given as
gifts, the Company has historically realized, and expects to
continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the
second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday
months of November and December. The Company has sometimes
experienced, and may continue to experience, reduced income or
net losses in any or all of its first, third or fourth quarters.
The higher sales in the second quarter typically result in
higher operating profits and margins. This is due to higher
gross profits, with no substantial corresponding increase in
fixed costs related to operating retail stores and



other administrative and selling costs which
remain fairly constant throughout the year. During the holiday
season these fixed costs are spread over higher sales, resulting
in greater operating income expressed in both dollars and as a
percentage of sales in the second quarter compared to the other
three quarters. The Company anticipates that its sales and
operating profit will continue to be seasonal in nature.

Item 7A

— Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Foreign
Exchange

Approximately 75% of our fiscal year 2001
non-licensed product needs were purchased from independent
manufacturers in countries other than the United States. These
countries include China, Costa Rica, Italy, India, Spain,
Turkey, Thailand, Mexico, Taiwan, Korea, Hungary, Singapore and
the Dominican Republic. Additionally, sales are made through
international channels to third party distributors.
Substantially all purchases and sales involving international
parties are denominated in U.S. dollars and, therefore, are not
hedged by the Company using any derivative instruments. The
Company has not used foreign exchange instruments in the past.
As a result of the creation of CJI and its related acquisition
in July 2001, the Company may enter into foreign currency
hedging transactions in the future.

Interest
Rate

The Company has a fixed rate long-term debt
related to the Jacksonville distribution center, in the amount
of $3.7 million as of June 30, 2001, and uses a
sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the change in fair
value of this debt instrument. At June 30, 2001, the effect
on the fair value of this debt of a 10% change in market
interest rates would be approximately $0.2 million. The Company
does not expect its operating results or cash flows to be
affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden
change in market interest rates.

Commodity

The Company buys tanned leather from various
suppliers based upon fixed price purchase contracts that extend
for periods up to six months. These purchases are not hedged
with any derivative instrument. Due to the purchase contracts
that are in place, the Company does not expect that a sudden
short-term change in leather prices will have a significant
effect on its operating results or cash flows, for the current
fiscal year. The Company uses a sensitivity analysis technique
to evaluate the change in fair value of the leather purchases
based upon longer-term price trends.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30,

COACH, INC.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Coach, Inc:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Coach, Inc. (a Maryland corporation) as of
June 30, 2001 and July 1, 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001,
July 1, 2000 and July 3, 1999. These financial
statements and the schedule referred to below are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Coach, Inc. as of June 30, 2001 and
July 1, 2000 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001,
July 1, 2000 and July 3, 1999, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an
opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The

1.  Basis of Presentation and
Organization

Coach (“Coach” or the
“Company”) was formed in 1941 and was acquired by the
Sara Lee Corporation (“Sara Lee”) in July 1985. Coach
was operated as a division of Sara Lee in the United States and
as a subsidiary in foreign countries until April 5, 2001.
On June 1, 2000, Coach was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Maryland. Pursuant to the Separation Agreements (as
filed on June 16, 2000), Sara Lee transferred to Coach the
assets and liabilities that related to the Coach business on
October 2, 2000 (“the Separation Date”), prior to
the date of completion of Coach’s initial public offering,
as further discussed below.

On October 5, 2000, Coach was listed on the
New York Stock Exchange and sold 7,380 shares of common stock in
an initial public offering, representing 17.4% of the
outstanding shares. On October 17, 2000, the underwriters
exercised their over-allotment option and purchased an
additional 1,107 shares of Coach common stock. In total, Coach
sold 8,487 shares of its common stock, representing 19.5% of the
outstanding shares. In April 2001, Sara Lee completed a
distribution of its ownership in Coach via an exchange offer.
That exchange offer allowed Sara Lee stockholders to tender Sara
Lee common stock for Coach common stock.

Coach designs, manufactures, markets and sells
primarily fine leather handbags and accessories. Coach products
are manufactured by third-party suppliers as well as by
Coach-operated manufacturing facilities. Coach markets products
via Company operated retail stores, direct mail catalogs, an
e-commerce website, factory stores, and via selected upscale
department and specialty retailer locations and international
department, retail and duty-free shop locations.

The consolidated financial statements of Coach
reflect the historical results of operations and cash flows of
the Coach leather goods and accessories business of Sara Lee
during each respective period until the Separation Date. Under
Sara Lee’s ownership, Coach’s United States operations
were a division of Sara Lee and not a separate legal entity,
while Coach’s foreign operations were subsidiaries of Sara
Lee. The historical financial statements have been prepared
using Sara Lee’s historical basis in the assets and
liabilities and the results of Coach’s business. The
financial information included herein may not reflect the
consolidated financial position, operating results, changes in
stockholders’ equity and cash flows of Coach in the future,
or what they would have been had Coach been a separate,
stand-alone entity during Sara Lee’s ownership. On the
Separation Date, Coach began operating as a separate legal
entity.

2.  Significant Accounting
Policies

Fiscal
year

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the
Saturday closest to June 30. The fiscal year ended
July 3, 1999 (“fiscal 1999”) was a 53-week year,
while the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 (“fiscal
2001”) and the fiscal year ended July 1, 2000
(“fiscal 2000”) were 52-week years. Unless otherwise
stated, references to years in the financial statements relate
to fiscal years.

Use of
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements; and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances within the Company are eliminated in
consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the
2000 and 1999 statements to conform with the 2001 presentation.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Cash consists of cash balances and short term
investments with a maturity of less than 90 days.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(determined by the first-in, first-out method) or market.
Inventory cost includes material and conversion costs.

Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over lives of
five to seven years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated
over lives of three to five years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
the related lease terms. Maintenance and repair costs are
charged to earnings while expenditures for major renewals and
improvements are capitalized. Upon the disposition of property
and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts.

Intangible
Assets

The excess of cost over fair market value of
tangible net assets (goodwill) and trademarks of acquired
businesses is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
periods of expected benefit, which range from 5 to
40 years. Accumulated amortization of intangible assets at
June 30, 2001 and July 1, 2000 was $10,503 and $9,603,
respectively.

Impairment of
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

Long-lived assets primarily include property,
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 121 “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of” (“SFAS
121”), long-lived assets being retained for use by the
Company are periodically reviewed for impairment by comparing
the carrying value of the assets with their estimated future
undiscounted cash flows. If it is determined that an impairment
loss has occurred, the loss would be recognized during the
period. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference
between asset carrying values and the present value of estimated
net cash flows or comparable market values, giving consideration
to recent operating performance.

Long-lived assets, which are to be disposed of,
are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less
cost to sell. Reductions in carrying value are recognized in the
period in which management commits to a plan to dispose of the
assets. No impairment loss was recognized in fiscal 2001, 2000
or 1999.



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

Revenue
Recognition

Sales are recognized at the “point of
sale”, which occurs when merchandise is sold in an
“over the counter” consumer transaction or upon
shipment to a customer. The Company maintains a reserve for
potential product returns and records its provision for
estimated product returns based upon historical experience. The
charge for estimated product returns is recorded against sales
for the period. Royalty revenues are earned through license
agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that
incorporate the Coach brand. Revenue earned under these
contracts is recognized based upon reported sales from the
licensee.

Advertising

Advertising costs, which include media and
production, totaled $16,445, $15,764 and $12,598 for the fiscal
years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Advertising costs are
expensed when the advertising first appears.

Shipping and
Handling

Shipping and handling expense is part of the
distribution and customer service component of selling, general
and administrative expense. These expenses were $6,039, $4,997
and $5,403 for fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Income
Taxes

The Company’s operating results have been
included in Sara Lee’s consolidated U.S. and state income
tax returns and in the tax returns of certain Sara Lee foreign
operations, for periods where Sara Lee owned greater than 80% of
the Company’s outstanding capital stock. During these
periods, the provision for income taxes in the Company’s
financial statements has been prepared as if the Company were a
stand-alone entity and filed separate tax returns.

The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes” (“SFAS 109”). Under SFAS 109, a deferred
tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future
tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
and their respective tax bases.

Stock Based
Compensation

Employee stock options are accounted for under
the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (“APB 25”). APB 25 requires the use of
the intrinsic value method, which measures compensation cost as
the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at
date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire
the stock. The Company makes pro forma disclosures of net
earnings and earnings per share as if the fair value based
method of accounting had been applied as required by SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).

Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The carrying amount of cash, trade accounts
receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt approximated
fair value as of July 1, 2000 and June 30, 2001. Coach
uses the present value technique to estimate fair market value
using discount rates which management believes are commensurate
with the risks involved.



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

Foreign
Currency

The functional currency of the Company’s
foreign operations is the applicable local currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange
rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income within
stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions were not significant for fiscal 2001, 2000
and 1999.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

Effective July 2, 2000, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”).
SFAS 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting
standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded
in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at
its fair value. The cumulative effect of adoption of
SFAS 133 did not result in a material impact on the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. Substantially, all purchases and sales involving
international parties are denominated in U.S. dollars and,
therefore, are not hedged using any derivative instruments.

In April 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) reached a final consensus on Issue 00-25
“Accounting for Consideration from a Vendor to a Retailer
in Connection with the Purchase or Promotion of the
Vendor’s Products.” This issue addresses the
recognition, measurement and income statement classification of
consideration provided to distributors or retailers. Previously,
the Company has recorded these activities within selling,
general and administrative expenses. The Company will adopt this
consensus in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. The effect on
adoption will result in a reclassification of $15,588, $11,224
and $6,837 from selling, general and administrative expenses to
a reduction in net sales for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations (“SFAS 141”) and No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (“SFAS 142”).
SFAS 141 requires all business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase
method. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed
annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for
impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to
have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their
useful lives (but with no maximum life). The amortization
provisions of SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets
acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and
intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the
Company is required to adopt SFAS 142 effective June 30,
2002. The Company is currently evaluating the effect adoption
will have on its results of operations and financial position.

Net Income
Per Share

Basic net income per share was calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period, excluding any potential dilution.
Diluted net income per share was calculated similarly but
includes potential dilution from the exercise of stock options
and stock awards. For comparison purposes only, the
weighted-average number of shares outstanding immediately
following the completion of the initial public offering was
considered to be outstanding in fiscal 2000. The difference
between the basic and diluted weighted-average shares
outstanding in fiscal 2001 is due to the dilutive effect of
stock options and restricted stock awards issued under the
Company’s stock option plans.

5.  Debt

Until February 27, 2001, Coach participated
in a cash concentration system requiring that cash balances be
deposited with Sara Lee, which were netted against
borrowings/billings provided by Sara Lee.

On July 2, 2000, Coach entered into a
revolving credit facility with Sara Lee. The maximum borrowing
permitted under this facility was $75,000. Interest accrued at
US dollar LIBOR plus 30 basis points. Any receivable balance
from Sara Lee under this facility earned interest at US dollar
LIBOR minus 20 basis points. The credit facility contained
certain covenants, with which all were complied. This facility
was terminated on February 27, 2001.

During October 2000, Coach completed an equity
restructuring which included the assumption of $190,000 of
long-term debt payable to a subsidiary of Sara Lee. This
long-term debt had an original maturity date of
September 30, 2002, accruing interest at U.S. dollar LIBOR
plus 30 basis points. The note contained certain covenants,
consistent with the above mentioned revolving credit facility.
The net proceeds of the initial public offering were used to
partially repay this loan resulting in a balance of $68,000 at
October 18, 2000. In January 2001, this loan was fully paid
off by the Company by redeeming the short-term investments with
Sara Lee and drawing down on the Sara Lee revolving credit
facility.

To provide funding for working capital for
operations and general corporate purposes, on February 27,
2001, Coach, certain lenders and Fleet National Bank, as primary
lender and administrative agent, entered into a $100,000 senior
unsecured revolving credit facility. Indebtedness under this
revolving credit facility bears interest calculated, at
Coach’s option, at either:

•

a rate of LIBOR plus 70 to 150 basis points based
	on a rolling four quarter fixed-charge coverage grid; or

•

the prime rate announced by Fleet.

The initial LIBOR margin under the facility was
125 basis points. As of May 2001, the LIBOR margin was reduced
to 100 basis points reflecting an improvement in our
fixed-charge coverage ratio, calculated quarterly in accordance
with the pricing grid. Under this revolving credit facility,
Coach will pay a commitment fee of 20 to 35 basis points based
on any unused amounts, based on the same fixed- charge coverage
grid. The initial commitment fee was 30 basis points. As of May
2001, the commitment fee was reduced to 25 basis points. This
credit facility may be prepaid without penalty or premium.



COACH, INC.

Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

The Fleet facility contains various covenants and
customary events of default, including:

The Company has been in compliance with all
covenants of the Fleet facility since its inception.

During fiscal 2001 the peak borrowings under the
Sara Lee and Fleet revolving credit facilities were $37,667 and
$31,000, respectively. As of June 30, 2001, the outstanding
borrowings under the Fleet facility were $7,700.

6.  Leases

Coach, as a division of Sara Lee, leased certain
office, distribution, retail and manufacturing facilities.
Substantially, all previous existing leases were guaranteed by
Sara Lee. All leases entered into after the Company’s
separation from Sara Lee are in the name of Coach, Inc. with no
connection to Sara Lee. The lease agreements, which expire at
various dates through 2015, are subject, in some cases, to
renewal options and provide for the payment of taxes, insurance
and maintenance. Certain leases contain escalation clauses
resulting from the pass through of increases in operating costs,
property taxes and the effect on costs from changes in consumer
price indices. Certain rentals are also contingent upon factors
such as sales. Rent-free periods and other incentives granted
under certain leases and scheduled rent increases are charged to
rent expense on a straight-line basis over the related terms of
such leases. Contingent rentals are recognized when the
achievement of the target, which triggers the related payment,
are considered probable. Rent expense for the Company’s
operating leases consisted of the following:

Future minimum rental payments under
non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

Certain operating leases provide for renewal for
periods of three to five years at their fair rental value at the
time of renewal. In the normal course of business, operating
leases are generally renewed or replaced by new leases.

7.  Commitments and
Contingencies

Currently, Sara Lee is a guarantor or a party to
many of Coach’s store leases. The Company has agreed to
make efforts to remove Sara Lee from all its existing leases and
Sara Lee is not a guarantor or a party to any new or renewed
leases. The Company has obtained a letter of credit for the
benefit of Sara Lee in an amount approximately equal to the
annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to the
Company by Sara Lee but for which Sara Lee retains contingent
liability. The Company is required to maintain the letter of
credit until the annual minimum rental payments under the
relevant leases are less than $2.0 million. The initial
letter of credit has a face amount of $20.6 million and the
Company expects this amount to decrease annually as its
guaranteed obligations are reduced. The Company expects that it
will be required to maintain the letter of credit for at least
10 years.

Coach is a party to several pending legal
proceedings and claims. Although the outcome of such items
cannot be determined with certainty, Coach’s general
counsel and management are of the opinion that the final outcome
should not have a material effect on Coach’s results of
operations or financial position.

8.  Reorganization Costs

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2001,
management of Coach committed to and announced a plan to cease
production at the Medley, Florida manufacturing facility in
October 2000 (the “Medley reorganization”). This
reorganization involved the termination of
362 manufacturing, warehousing and management employees at
the Medley facility. These actions are intended to reduce costs
by the resulting transfer of production to lower cost
third-party manufacturers. The Medley facility is a cost center
and separate profitability measures are not available. This
facility was treated as a held-for-sale facility under SFAS 121
since the decision to dispose of it was made. Depreciation
expense of $252 and $852 for fiscal years 2001 and 2000,
respectively, was recognized for this facility.

Coach recorded reorganization costs of $4,950 in
the first quarter of fiscal year 2001. In the second half of
fiscal year 2001, this charge was reduced to $4,569. These
reductions were primarily due to the complete disposition of the
fixed assets. The net proceeds from the disposition were greater
than the estimate. These reorganization costs include $3,103 for
worker separation costs, $832 for lease termination costs, and
$634 for the write down of long-lived assets to their net
realizable values. The $4,569 of Medley reorganization cost
recognized in the financial statements for fiscal year 2001
differs from management’s earlier estimate of $6,300
included in the notes to the fiscal year 2000 financial
statements. This change is attributable to management’s
continued negotiations with both the landlord and the employees
at the facility and the resulting refinement of the cost
estimates made prior to the finalization and recognition of this
plan of reorganization.

The composition of the reorganization reserve is
set forth in the table below. By June 30, 2001, production
ceased at the Medley facility, disposition of the fixed assets
had been accomplished and the termination of the 362 employees
had been completed. The Medley reorganization actions are
complete and the reserve was fully utilized.



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per

During 1999, Coach closed its Carlstadt, New
Jersey warehouse and distribution center, and its Italian
manufacturing operation and reorganized its Medley, Florida
manufacturing facility (the “Carlstadt
reorganization”). As contemplated in the original plan, a
portion of the Carlstadt facility remains in use for product
development. Related to these facility closures and the
reorganization activities, 737 employees were terminated. At
July 1, 2000, these reorganization actions were complete
and certain workers’ separation costs remained to be paid
subject to the separation agreements with each employee. During
fiscal 2001 workers’ separation costs of $142 were paid.
The Carlstadt reorganization is now complete and the reserve was
fully utilized.

9.     Stock-Based
Compensation

Sara Lee
Stock-Based Plans

For the period through the completion of the
exchange offer in April 2001, Coach employees participated in
stock-based compensation plans of Sara Lee. Sara Lee maintains
various stock option, employee stock purchase and stock award
plans.

Stock
Options

The exercise price of each stock option equals
100% of the market price of Sara Lee’s stock on the date of
grant and generally has a maximum term of 10 years. Options
generally vest ratably over three years. During 1998, Sara Lee
instituted a broad-based stock option incentive program under
which Sara Lee granted options, to essentially all full-time
Coach employees, to purchase a total of approximately 449 shares
of Sara Lee common stock. Under certain stock option plans, an
active employee may receive a Sara Lee replacement stock option
equal to the number of shares surrendered upon a stock-for-stock
exercise. The exercise price of the replacement option is 100%
of the market value at the date of exercise of the original
option and will remain exercisable for the remaining term of the
original option. Replacement stock options generally vest six
months from the grant date.



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

A summary of options held by Coach employees and
retirees under Sara Lee option plans follows:

The fair value of each Coach option grant under
the Sara Lee plans is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the following
weighted-average assumptions:

The weighted-average fair value of individual
options granted during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $4.65, $4.96 and
$4.73, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“ESPP”).

Sara Lee
maintained an ESPP that permitted full-time Coach employees to
purchase a limited number of Sara Lee common shares at 85% of
market value. Under the plan, Sara Lee sold 57, 100 and
81 shares to Coach employees in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Pro forma compensation expense is calculated
for the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights using
the Black-Scholes model. Assumptions include an expected life of
  1/4 of a year and weighted-average risk-free interest
rates of 5.4%, 5.4% and 4.6% in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Other underlying assumptions are consistent
with those used for the Sara Lee stock option plans described
above.

Stock Unit Awards.

Restricted stock unit awards of
Sara Lee stock are granted to Coach employees as performance
awards and retention awards. The value of performance awards is
determined assuming the employee meets the performance
requirements and based upon the estimated fair value of the
stock earned at the end of the performance cycle. The value is
accrued through a charge to earnings as the award vests. The



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

vesting period is typically three years. The
value of retention awards is determined assuming the employee
meets the retention requirements and based upon the fair value
of the Sara Lee stock at the grant date. The value is accrued
through a charge to earnings over the retention period. The
retention period is typically three years.

All stock unit awards are restricted and subject
to forfeiture and entitle the participant to dividends that are
escrowed until the participant receives the shares. The expense
related to these awards for fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 was
$1,043, $963 and $660, respectively.

Coach Stock-Based Plans.

Coach established the 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan and the 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan to
award stock options and other forms of equity compensation to
certain members of Coach management and the outside members of
its Board of Directors. The exercise price of each stock option
equals 100% of the market price of Coach’s stock on the
date of grant and generally has a maximum term of 10 years.
Options generally vest ratably over three years.

Concurrent with the initial public offering in
October 2000, Coach granted 3,191 options to essentially
all full-time employees and 15 options to outside members
of the Board of Directors at the initial public offering price
of $16.

Certain employees with the title of Director or
above who held Sara Lee stock options at the initial public
offering date were given the right to convert the Sara Lee
option into Coach options. Any Sara Lee option converted into a
Coach option generally may not be exercised until the earlier of
one year following conversion, or at the time Sara Lee ceases to
own at least 80% of Coach’s outstanding capital stock,
subject to the original vesting requirements. Coach employees,
at the initial public offering date, converted 1,204 Sara
Lee options into the same number of Coach options while
maintaining the same exercise price.

A summary of options held by Coach employees
under Coach option plans follows:



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

The following table summarizes information about
stock options held by Coach employees under Coach option plans
at June 30, 2001.

The fair value of each Coach option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model and the assumption for expected lives of
three years, a risk free interest rate of 5.97%, expected
volatility of 49% and no dividend yield.

The weighted average fair value of individual
options granted during fiscal 2001 was $6.67. Under APB 25,
no compensation cost is recognized for stock options and
replacement stock options under the stock-based compensation
plans and shares purchased under ESPP. Had compensation cost for
the grants for stock-based compensation been determined
consistent with SFAS 123, net income and net income per
share, basic and diluted, for fiscal 2001 would have been as
follows:

10.     Retirement
Plans

Coach sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit
plan, The Coach Leatherware Company, Inc. Supplemental Pension
Plan, for individuals who are a part of collective bargaining
arrangements.

Employees who meet certain eligibility
requirements and are not part of a collective bargaining
arrangement participate in defined benefit pension plans
sponsored by Sara Lee through June 30, 2001. These defined
benefit pension plans include employees from a number of
domestic Sara Lee business units. The annual cost of the Sara
Lee defined benefit plans is allocated to all of the
participating businesses based upon a specific actuarial
computation. All obligations pursuant to these plans are
obligations of Sara Lee.

The annual expense incurred by Coach for the
defined benefit plans is as follows:

11.     Segment
Information

The Company operates its business in two
reportable segments: Direct to Consumer and Indirect. The
Company’s reportable segments represent channels of
distribution that offer similar merchandise, service and
marketing strategies. Sales of Coach products through
Company-owned retail and factory stores, the Coach catalogue and
the internet constitute the Direct to Consumer segment. Indirect
refers to sales of Coach products to other retailers. In
deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance,
Coach’s executive officers regularly evaluate the sales and
operating income of these segments. Operating income is the
gross margin of the segment at standard cost less direct
expenses of the segment.

Unallocated corporate expenses include
manufacturing variances, general marketing, administration and
information systems, distribution and customer service expenses.

12.     Earnings Per
Share

Prior to October 2, 2000, Coach operated as
a division of Sara Lee and did not have any shares outstanding.
The initial capitalization of Coach, Inc. was one share. On
October 2, 2000, a stock dividend was declared resulting in
35,026 shares held by Sara Lee. The number of shares
outstanding has been restated to reflect the effect of this
stock dividend for all periods presented prior to
October 2, 2000. During October 2000, the initial public
offering of the Company’s common stock was accomplished
resulting in the issuance of an additional 8,487 shares.
Following the offering, 43,513 shares were outstanding.
Dilutive securities include share equivalents held in employee
benefit programs and the impact of stock option programs.

The following is a reconciliation of the
weighted-average shares outstanding:

(1)

As of April 5, 2001, Sara Lee divested all
	its shares in Coach.

Diluted net income per share was $1.52 in fiscal
2001. This reflects a weighted-average of the shares outstanding
before and after the public offering of common stock in October
2000. If the common shares sold in the October 2000 initial
public offering had been outstanding for the entire year, net
income before the impact of reorganization costs per diluted
share would have been $1.50. Prior years’ diluted net
income per share was $1.10 and $0.48 for fiscal 2000 and 1999,
respectively, since only the shares owned by Sara Lee are used
in the calculation. Comparable net earnings per share would have
been $0.89 and $0.38 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively if
the common shares sold in the October 2000 initial public
offering had been outstanding for the prior periods.

13.  Relationship with Sara
Lee

administration costs for treasury, real estate, accounting,

administration.

14.     Shareholder
Rights Plan

On May 3, 2001 Coach declared a “poison
pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional
common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of
Coach’s common stock.

Subject to limited exceptions, these rights may
be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10% or
more of the Company’s common stock or announces a tender
offer for 10% or more of the common stock on terms not approved
by Coach’s Board of Directors. In this event, each right
would entitle the holder of each share of Coach’s common
stock to buy one additional common share of the Company at an
exercise price far below the then-current market price. Subject
to certain exceptions, Coach’s Board of Directors will be
entitled to redeem the rights at $0.001 per right at any time
before the close of business on the tenth day following either
the public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of
Coach’s Board of Directors becomes aware that, a person has
acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. The
Company is currently aware of two institutional shareholders
whose common stock holdings exceed the 10% threshold established
by the rights plan. Each of these holders has been given
permission to increase its ownership in the Company to a maximum
of 15%, subject to certain exceptions, before triggering the
provision of the rights plan.

15.     Formation of
Coach Japan, Inc.

In June 2001, Coach Japan, Inc. (“CJI”)
was formed. This entity is a joint venture with Sumitomo
Corporation and will manage the Coach business in Japan. Coach
owns 50% of CJI and has appointed a majority of the Board of
Directors. It will be accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary.

CJI plans to open additional locations within
existing major retailers, enter new department store
relationships and open freestanding retail locations. There are
currently a total of 76 Coach locations in Japan, including 62
department stores and 14 retail stores managed by two
distributors.

16.     Subsequent
Event

On July 31, 2001, CJI completed the purchase
of 100% of the capital stock of PDC from the Mitsukoshi
Department Store Group (“Mitsukoshi”) for a total
purchase price of $7,194. Mitsukoshi established PDC in 1991 to
expand Coach distribution to select department stores throughout
Japan. With this acquisition, CJI will manage all locations
currently operated by Mitsukoshi, who will remain a key retailer
for the brand. Excess purchase price over fair market value of
the underlying net assets was allocated to goodwill based on
preliminary estimates of fair values, and is subject to
adjustment. Goodwill will be reviewed annually for impairment.
The fair value of assets acquired was $21,042 and liabilities
assumed was $15,394. Included in the liabilities is an
assumption of debt of $13,430. Annual net sales of PDC in 2001
was $47,476 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2001. In
August 2001 operations commenced. Unaudited pro forma
information related to this acquisition is not included, as the
impact of this transaction is not material to the consolidated
results of the Company. This acquisition does not violate the
covenants of the Fleet facility.
