COACH, INC.

TABLE OF CONTENTS FORM 10-K



Founded in 1941, Coach has grown from a
family-run workshop in a Manhattan loft to a leading American
designer and marketer of high-quality fine accessories and gifts
for women and men. Coach developed its initial expertise in the
small-scale production of classic, high-quality leather goods
constructed from “glove-tanned” leather with close
attention to detail. Coach sells its products worldwide through
its own retail stores, select department stores, its on-line
store and its catalogs. Coach has built upon its brand awareness
in the United States by expanding into international markets,
particularly in Japan and East Asia, diversifying its product
offerings beyond leather handbags, further developing its
multi-channel distribution strategy and licensing products with
the Coach brand name.

PART I

Item 1.

Business of Coach, Inc.

OVERVIEW

Coach is a designer and marketer of high-quality,
modern American classic accessories. Coach believes that it is
one of the best recognized fine accessories brands in the U.S.
and is enjoying increased recognition in targeted international
markets. Net sales were $1,321.1 million in the year ended
July 3, 2004 (“fiscal 2004”), $953.2 million
in the year ended June 28, 2003 (“fiscal 2003”)
and $719.4 million in the year ended June 29, 2002
(“fiscal 2002”). Operating income was
$444.5 million in fiscal 2004, $243.8 million in
fiscal 2003 and $133.6 million in fiscal 2002. Coach’s
primary product offerings include handbags, women’s and
men’s small leather goods, business cases, weekend and
travel accessories, outerwear and related accessories. Together
with its licensing partners, Coach also offers watches,
footwear, eyewear and office furniture with the Coach brand name.

Coach’s products are sold through a number
of direct to consumer channels, which at the end of fiscal 2004
included:

Coach’s direct-to-consumer business
represented approximately 55% of its total sales in fiscal 2004.

Coach’s remaining sales were generated from
products sold through a number of indirect channels, which at
the end of fiscal 2004 included:

Over the last several years, Coach has
successfully transformed itself from a manufacturer of
traditionally styled classic leather products to a marketer of
modern, fashionable handbags and accessories, using a broader
range of fabrics and materials. Today, Coach’s updated
styles and multiple product categories address an increasing
portion of its consumer’s accessory wardrobe, responding to
its customer’s demands for both fashion and function. Along
with the rejuvenation of the product line, Coach has created a
similarly modern environment to showcase its product assortments
and reinforce a consistent brand position. Finally, Coach has
established a flexible, cost-effective manufacturing model in
which independent manufacturers supply virtually all of its
products, which allows Coach to bring its broader range of
products to market more rapidly and efficiently.

Coach has developed a number of key
differentiating elements that set it apart from the competitive
landscape including:

A Distinctive
Brand

— Coach is one of
America’s leading accessible luxury accessories brand,
offering an aspirational product that is relevant, extremely
well made and provides exceptional value.

A Market Leadership Position with Growing
Share

— Coach is
America’s leading accessories brand and each year, as its
market share increases, our leadership position strengthens.



Coach’s Loyal and Involved
Consumer

— Coach
consumers have a specific emotional connection with the brand.
Part of the Company’s everyday mission is to cultivate
consumer relationships by strengthening this emotional
connection.

Multi-Channel International
Distribution

— This
allows Coach to maintain a critical balance as results do not
depend solely on the performance of a single channel or
geographic area.

Coach is Innovative and
Consumer-Centric

— Coach
listens to its consumer through rigorous consumer research and
strong customer orientation. Coach works to anticipate the
consumer’s changing needs by keeping the product assortment
fresh and relevant.

Coach believes that these differentiating
elements have enabled the Company to offer a unique proposition
in the market place. In fiscal 2004, net sales increased 38.6%
and operating income increased 82.3%, compared to fiscal 2003.
In fiscal 2003, net sales increased 32.5% and operating income
increased 82.4%, compared to fiscal 2002.

Growth Strategies

Based on its established strengths Coach is
pursuing the following strategies for future growth:

Expand Market
Share.

Coach is driving market
share by leveraging its leadership position as an accessible
luxury lifestyle brand and gaining a greater share of its
consumer’s accessories wardrobe. Coach is intensifying
awareness as an everyday accessory resource, by offering
aspirational, stylish, well-made product. As part of this
strategy, Coach is emphasizing new usage occasions, such as
weekend and evening, and offering items at a broader range of
prices.

Grow North American Retail Store
Base.

Coach believes that it has a
successful retail store format that reinforces its brand image,
generates strong sales per square foot and can be readily
adapted to different location requirements. The modernized store
environment has an open, loft-like feeling, with crisp white
brick walls and a timeless, uncluttered look. Over the next four
to five years, Coach plans to open approximately 100 retail
stores in North America, bringing the retail store base to over
275 stores. In fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, Coach opened 19 and
20 new retail stores, respectively. It generally takes four to
six months from the time Coach takes possession of a store to
open it. In addition, Coach is also expanding select highly
productive locations. In fiscal 2004, nine stores were expanded.
We expect to expand at least nine stores in the fiscal year
ending July 2, 2005 (“fiscal 2005”). We also
expect to drive comparable store sales gains through higher
traffic by attracting new and existing consumers more often,
generating higher average ticket and increasing units per
transaction. In addition, we have evolved our in-store marketing
programs to create a more satisfying, service-oriented, shopping
experience.

Expand Business with the Japanese Consumer
Worldwide.

Coach is aggressively
raising brand awareness with the Japanese consumer. Japanese
women spend four times per capita globally, on luxury
accessories, than her American counterpart, with approximately
half of her worldwide spending on these items occurring outside
of Japan.

Domestically in Japan, in June 2001, we
established Coach Japan, Inc. We then acquired the existing
distributors and expanded the number of locations and retail
square footage. We have continued to grow market share and now
hold the number two position within the imported luxury
accessories market.

Japanese also seek to purchase luxury accessories
when traveling internationally. In order to capitalize on this
opportunity, we will continue to open image enhancing locations
wherever the Japanese consumer chooses to shop. Important
U.S. travel destinations include Hawaii, California, New
York and Orlando, Florida. In these key locations, we strive to
provide the Japanese consumer with a superior level of customer
service tailored specifically to her needs, including bi-lingual
staff. In addition, a significant number of the International
stores, which are operated by our distributors, are located in
key Japanese travel destinations such as Korea and Hong Kong.

Improve Operational
Efficiencies.

Coach has upgraded
and reorganized its manufacturing, distribution and information
systems over the past several years to allow it to bring new and
existing products to market



more efficiently. While enhancing its quality
control standards, Coach has shifted its manufacturing processes
from owned domestic factories to independent manufacturers in
lower cost markets. As a result, Coach has increased its
flexibility, improved its quality and lowered its costs. In
fiscal 2004, Coach’s gross margin increased to 74.9% from
71.1% in fiscal 2003. This improvement was driven by a shift in
channel mix, as our highest gross margin channels grew faster
than the business as a whole; a shift in product mix, reflecting
increased penetration of higher margin mixed material product
and accessories; and sourcing cost initiatives. Coach expects
these factors to continue to drive gross margin rate improvement.

Coach’s Products

Handbags.

Coach’s original business, the design, manufacture and
distribution of fine handbags, accounted for approximately 58%
of net sales in fiscal 2004. Coach makes monthly offerings of
its handbag collections, featuring classically inspired designs
as well as fashion trend designs. Typically, there are three to
four collections per quarter and four to seven styles per
collection, depending on the concept and opportunity.

Accessories.

Women’s accessories, consisting of wallets, wristlets,
cosmetic cases, key fobs and belts, represented approximately
19% of Coach’s net sales in fiscal 2004. Coach’s small
leather goods collections are coordinated with our handbags.
Men’s accessories, consisting of belts, wallets and other
small leather goods, represented approximately 4% of
Coach’s net sales in fiscal 2004.

Business
Cases.

Business cases represented
approximately 4% of Coach’s net sales in fiscal 2004. This
category includes computer bags and messenger-style bags, as
well as men’s and women’s totes.

Outerwear, Gloves, Hats and
Scarves.

This category represented
approximately 4% of Coach’s net sales in fiscal 2004. The
assortment is approximately 85% women’s and contains a
fashion assortment in all four components of this category.

Weekend and Travel
Accessories.

The Coach weekend and
travel collections are comprised of cabin bags, duffels,
suitcases, garment bags and a comprehensive collection of travel
accessories. Weekend and travel accessories represented
approximately 2% of Coach’s net sales in fiscal 2004.

Watches.

Movado Group, Inc. (“Movado”) has been Coach’s
watch licensee since 1998 and has developed a distinctive
collection of watches inspired by both the women’s and
men’s collections. These watches are primarily manufactured
in Switzerland and are branded with the Coach name and logo.

Footwear.

Jimlar Corporation (“Jimlar”) has been Coach’s
footwear licensee since 1999. The footwear is developed and
manufactured primarily in Italy and is distributed through more
than 500 locations in the U.S., including leading Coach retail
stores and U.S. department stores. Approximately 90% of
this business is in women’s footwear, which coordinates
with Coach handbags and employs fine materials, including calf
and suede.

Eyewear.

In
the fall of 2003, Coach eyewear was launched with Marchon
Eyewear (“Marchon”) as the licensee. The eyewear
collection is a collaborative effort from Marchon and Coach that
combines the Coach aesthetic for fashion accessories with the
latest fashion directions in eyewear and sunglasses. Coach
sunglasses are sold in Coach retail stores, department stores,
select sunglass retailers and optical retailers in major
markets. The ophthalmic collection is available through
Marchon’s extensive network of optical retailers.

Design and Merchandising

Coach’s New York-based design team, led by
its executive creative director, is responsible for
conceptualizing and directing the design of all Coach products.
Designers have access to Coach’s extensive archives of
product designs created over the past 60 years, which are a
valuable resource for new product concepts. Coach designers are
also supported by a strong merchandising team that analyzes
sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify
business opportunities that help guide each season’s design
process. Merchandisers also analyze products to edit, add and
delete styles to achieve profitable sales across channels. Three
product category teams, each comprised of design,
merchandising/product development and



manufacturing specialists, help Coach execute
design concepts that are consistent with the brand’s
strategic direction.

Coach’s merchandising team works in close
collaboration with our licensing partners to ensure that the
licensed products, such as watches, footwear, eyewear and office
furniture, are conceptualized and designed to address the
intended market opportunity and convey the distinctive
perspective and lifestyle associated with the Coach brand. While
Coach’s licensing partners may employ their own designers,
Coach oversees the development of their collection concepts and
the design of licensed products. Licensed products are also
subject to Coach’s quality control standards and we
exercise final approval for all new products prior to their sale.

Marketing

Coach’s marketing strategy is to deliver a
consistent message every time the consumer comes in contact with
the Coach brand, through all of its communications and visual
merchandising. The Coach image is created and executed
internally by the creative marketing, visual merchandising and
public relations teams.

In conjunction with promoting a consistent global
image, Coach uses its extensive customer database and consumer
knowledge to target specific products and communications to
specific consumers to efficiently stimulate sales across all
distribution channels.

Coach engages in a wide range of direct marketing
activities, including catalogs, brochures and email contacts
targeted to promote sales to consumers in their preferred
shopping venue. As part of Coach’s direct marketing
strategy, it uses its database consisting of approximately
7.5 million active U.S. households. Catalogs and email
contacts are Coach’s principal means of communication and
are sent to selected households to stimulate consumer purchases
and build brand awareness. The growing number of visitors to the
www.coach.com on-line store provides an opportunity to increase
the size of this database. Coach’s on-line store, like its
catalogs and brochures, provides a showcase environment where
consumers can browse through a strategic offering of our latest
styles and colors in order to increase both on-line and store
sales as well as build brand awareness.

In the U.S. and Japan, Coach spent approximately
$22 million, or 2% of net sales in fiscal 2004, for
national, regional and local advertising, primarily print and
outdoor advertising, in support of its major selling seasons.
Coach catalogs and www.coach.com also serve as effective brand
communications vehicles, driving store traffic as well as
direct-to-consumer sales. Coach’s co-branding partners
include Canon, Palm and Motorola. Through their targeted sales
and advertising programs, they have helped to strengthen
Coach’s brand cachet. Advertising by the co-branding
partners provides important additional exposure of the Coach
brand, although the revenues generated from the purchase of
Coach products by the co-branding partners are not material to
the Coach business.

Coach also has a sophisticated consumer and
market research capability, which helps us assess consumer
attitudes and trends and gauge the likelihood of success in the
marketplace prior to product introduction.

Channels of Distribution

Direct Channels

Coach has four different direct channels that
provide it with immediate, controlled access to consumers:
retail stores, factory stores, the internet and catalog. The
direct-to-consumer channels represented approximately 55% of
Coach’s total net sales in fiscal year 2004.

North American Retail
Stores.

Coach’s retail stores
establish, reinforce and capitalize on the image of the Coach
brand. Coach operates 174 retail stores in North America that
are located in upscale regional shopping centers and
metropolitan areas. It operates flagship stores, which offer the
broadest assortment of



Coach products, in high-visibility locations such
as New York, Chicago and San Francisco. The following table
shows the number of Coach retail stores and their total and
average square footage:

Depending on their size and location, the retail
stores present product lines that include handbags, business
cases, wallets, footwear, watches, weekend and related
accessories. The modern store design creates a distinctive
environment that showcases these various products. Store
associates are trained to maintain high standards of visual
presentation, merchandising and customer service. The result is
a complete statement of the Coach modern American style at the
retail level.

North American Factory
Stores.

Coach’s 76 factory
stores serve as an efficient means to sell
manufactured-for-factory-store product as well as discontinued
and irregular inventory, outside the retail channel. These
stores operate under the Coach Factory name and are
geographically positioned primarily in established centers that
are usually between 50 to 100 miles from major markets. The
following table shows the number of Coach factory stores and
their total and average square footage:

Coach’s factory store design, visual
presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce
the brand’s image. Prices are generally discounted from 10%
to 50% below full retail prices. Through these factory stores,
Coach targets both value-oriented customers who would not
otherwise buy the Coach brand and dual channel shoppers.

Internet.

Coach views its website as a key communications vehicle for the
brand to promote traffic in Coach retail stores and department
store locations. Like Coach catalogs and brochures, the on-line
store provides a showcase environment where consumers can browse
through a selected offering of the latest styles and colors.

Catalog.

Coach mailed its first Coach catalog in 1980. In fiscal 2004,
the Company distributed approximately 3.6 million catalogs
in Coach stores and mailed a Coach catalog to about one million
strategically selected U.S. households, from its database.
While direct mail sales comprise a small portion of Coach’s
net sales, Coach views its catalog as a key communications
vehicle for the brand because it promotes store traffic and
facilitates the shopping experience in Coach retail stores. As
an integral component of its communications strategy, the
graphics, models and photography are upscale and modern and
present the product in an environment consistent with the Coach
brand position. The catalogs highlight selected products



and serve as a reference for customers, whether
ordering through the catalog, making in-store purchases or
purchasing over the Internet.

Indirect Channels

Coach began as a wholesaler to department stores.
This channel remains very important to its overall consumer
reach. Coach has grown its indirect business by the formation of
Coach Japan and working closely with its partners, both domestic
and international, to ensure a clear and consistent product
presentation. The indirect channel represented approximately 45%
of total net sales in fiscal 2004.

Coach Japan,
Inc.

Coach is aggressively
expanding market share and raising brand awareness with the
Japanese consumer, primarily by opening flagship and
freestanding stores. As of July 3, 2004, there were
100 Coach locations in Japan, including 77 department store
shop-in-shops, three flagship locations, and 10 retail and 10
factory stores. The three flagship stores, which offer the
broadest assortment of Coach products, are located in the Ginza,
Shibuya and Marunouchi shopping districts of Tokyo. Coach Japan
plans to open at least three additional flagship locations and
eight other locations in fiscal 2005. In addition, to strengthen
Coach’s presence in premier department stores, Coach Japan
is expanding select highly productive shop-in-shops in these
department stores. Coach Japan expanded 16 locations during
fiscal 2004 and plans to expand an additional 14 locations
during fiscal 2005. Lastly, Coach Japan is driving sales through
improved store productivity by providing distinctive newness to
the Japanese marketplace, where innovation is key. This channel
represented approximately 21% of total net sales in fiscal 2004.
The following table shows the number of Coach Japan locations
and their total and average square footage:

In June 2001, Coach and Sumitomo Corporation
(“Sumitomo”) commenced a joint venture to form Coach
Japan, Inc., in order to operate the Coach business in Japan.
During fiscal 2002, Coach Japan acquired the prior distributors
of Coach products in Japan, in order to expand its presence in
the Japanese market and to exercise greater control over its
brand in that country. Coach owns 50% of Coach Japan, however,
as Coach appoints a majority of the Board of Directors it is
deemed to have control; as such, Coach Japan is accounted for as
a consolidated subsidiary. Under the terms of the joint venture
agreement, Coach supplies its merchandise to Coach Japan for
distribution and sale in Japan.

U.S. Wholesale.

Coach’s products are sold to nearly 1,100
U.S. wholesale locations and represented approximately 11%
of total net sales in fiscal 2004. This channel offers access to
Coach consumers who prefer shopping at department stores or who
live in geographic areas that are not large enough to support a
Coach retail store. Recognizing the continued importance of
U.S. department stores as a distribution channel for
premier accessories, Coach has fine-tuned its strategy to
increase productivity and drive volume, by enhancing
presentation, primarily though the creation of more
shop-in-shops and the introduction of caseline enhancements with
proprietary Coach fixtures. We are also custom-tailoring
assortments to better match the attributes of our department
store consumers, in each local market. Coach’s more
significant U.S. wholesale customers are Federated
Department Stores (including Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s,
and Burdine’s), May Co. (including Lord and Taylor and
Filene’s), Dillard’s, Nordstrom, Marshall Fields, and
Saks, Inc.

International
Wholesale.

Coach’s
international business, which represented approximately 7% of
total net sales in fiscal 2004, is generated through wholesale
distributors and authorized retailers. Coach has



developed relationships with a select group of
distributors who market Coach products through specialty
retailers, department stores, travel shopping locations, and
freestanding Coach stores in 17 countries. Coach’s
current network of international distributors serves markets
such as Korea, Hong Kong, Guam, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia,
Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, China, the Caribbean, the United
Kingdom, Thailand, New Zealand and Malaysia. Coach has created
image enhancing environments in these locations to increase
brand appeal and stimulate growth. Within the international
arena, the primary focus is the Japanese consumer. Coach targets
this consumer in Japan and in areas with significant levels of
Japanese tourism as per capita spending on luxury accessories by
Japanese consumers is substantially greater than in the
U.S. Coach’s more significant international wholesale
customers include the DFS Group and Unisia.

The following table shows the number of
international retail stores, international department store
locations and other international locations at which Coach
products are sold:

Business to
Business.

As part of the indirect
channel of distribution, Coach sells some of its products
through corporate incentive and gift-giving programs.

Licensing.

In
our licensing relationships, Coach takes an active role in the
design process and controls the marketing and distribution of
products under the Coach brand. The current licensing
relationships as of July 3, 2004 are as follows:

Products made under license are, in most cases,
sold through all of the channels discussed above and, with
Coach’s approval, these licensees have the right to
distribute Coach brand products selectively through several
other channels: shoes in department store shoe salons, watches
in selected jewelry stores and eyewear in selected optical
retailers. These venues provide additional, yet controlled,
exposure of the Coach brand. Coach’s licensing partners pay
us royalties on their net sales of Coach branded products.
However, such royalties are not material to the Coach business
as they currently comprise less than 1% of Coach’s total
revenues. The licensing agreements generally give Coach the
right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are
not achieved.

Manufacturing

Coach has refined its production capabilities in
coordination with the repositioning of its brand. By shifting
its production from owned domestic facilities to independent
manufacturers in lower-cost markets, it can support a broader
mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new,
more fashion-oriented styles. During fiscal year 2004,
approximately 61% of Coach’s total net sales, excluding
Coach Japan, were generated from products introduced within the
fiscal year. At the same time, we help manage total inventory
and limit our exposure to excess and obsolete inventory by
designating a significant number of the new styles as
“limited editions” that are planned to be offered for
a brief time and then replaced with fresh new products.



Coach has developed a flexible model that meets
shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer
preferences. It uses two main sources to make Coach products:
outsourcing with skilled partners and production by its
licensing partners. All product sources must achieve and
maintain Coach’s high quality standards, which are an
integral part of the Coach identity. One of Coach’s keys to
success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials. Coach
has long-standing relationships with purveyors of fine leathers
and hardware. As it has moved its production to external
sources, Coach still requires that these same raw materials are
used in all of its products, wherever they are made. We monitor
compliance with the quality control standards through on-site
quality inspections at all independent manufacturing facilities.

All of Coach’s fiscal year 2004 product
requirements were supplied by independent manufacturers. Coach
buys independently manufactured products from many countries,
including China, Turkey, India, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic,
Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, Spain,
Taiwan and Thailand. Coach operates sourcing offices in
Hong Kong, China and South Korea that work closely
with our sourced vendors. Coach also operates a European
sourcing and product development organization based in Florence,
Italy that works closely with the New York design team. This
broad-based multi-country manufacturing strategy is designed to
optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction
capabilities. Coach carefully balances its commitments to a
limited number of “better brand” partners with
demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. No one
vendor provides more than 15% of Coach’s total
requirements. Before partnering with a vendor, Coach evaluates
each facility by conducting a quality and business practice
standards audit. Periodic evaluations of existing, previously
approved facilities are conducted on a random basis. We believe
that all of our manufacturing partners are in compliance with
Coach’s integrity standards.

Distribution

Coach operates a warehousing, distribution and
repair facility in Jacksonville, Florida. This computerized,
560,000 square foot facility uses a bar code scanning
warehouse management system. Coach’s distribution center
employees use handheld optical scanners to read product bar
codes, which allow them to more accurately process and pack
orders, track shipments, manage inventory and generally provide
better service to our customers. Coach’s products are
primarily shipped via Federal Express and common carrier to
Coach retail stores and wholesale customers and via Federal
Express direct to consumers.

Management Information Systems

The foundation of Coach’s information
systems is its Enterprise Resource Planning system. This fully
integrated system supports all aspects of finance and
accounting, procurement, inventory control, sales and store
replenishment. The system functions as a central repository for
all of Coach’s transactional information, resulting in
increased efficiencies, improved inventory control and a better
understanding of consumer demand. This system is fully scalable
to accommodate rapid growth.

Complementing its Enterprise Resource Planning
system are several other system solutions, each of which Coach
believes is well-suited for its needs. The data warehouse system
summarizes the transaction information and provides a single
platform for all management reporting. The supply chain
management system supports corporate sales and inventory
functions, creating a monthly demand plan and reconciling
production/ procurement with financial plans. Product
fulfillment is facilitated by Coach’s highly automated
warehouse management system and electronic data interchange
system, while the unique requirements of Coach’s Internet
and catalog businesses are supported by Coach’s order
management system. Finally, the point-of-sale system supports
all in-store transactions, distributes management reporting to
each store, and collects sales and payroll information on a
daily basis. This daily collection of store sales and inventory
information results in early identification of business trends
and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory
replenishment. Updates and upgrades of these systems are made on
a periodic basis in order to ensure that we constantly improve
our functionality. All complementary systems are integrated with
the central Enterprise Resource Planning system.



Trademarks and Patents

Coach owns all of the material trademark rights
used in connection with the production, marketing and
distribution of all of its products, both in the U.S. and in
other countries in which the products are principally sold.
Coach owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks
in all relevant classes of products in each of the countries in
which Coach products are sold. Its major trademarks include

Coach, Coach and lozenge design

and

Coach and tag
design

and it has applications pending for a proprietary

“C” signature fabric design.

Coach is not
dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent
although Coach believes that the Coach name is important for its
business. In addition, several of Coach’s products are
covered by design patents or patent applications. Coach
aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues
infringers both domestically and internationally. It also
pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through
leads generated internally, as well as through its network of
investigators, the Coach hotline and business partners around
the world.

Coach’s trademarks in the United States will
remain in existence for as long as Coach continues to use and
renew them on their expiration date. Coach has no material
patents.

Employees

As of July 3, 2004, Coach employed
approximately 4,200 people, about 50 of which were covered by
collective bargaining agreements. Of the total, 2,400 are
engaged in retail selling and administration positions, 400 are
engaged in sourcing or distribution functions and 700 are
employed through Coach Japan. The remaining employees are
engaged in other aspects of the Coach business. Coach believes
that its relations with its employees are good, and it has never
encountered a strike or significant work stoppage.

Government Regulation

Most of Coach’s imported products are
subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas that
may limit the quantity of products that Coach may import into
the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such
products. Coach has not been restricted by quotas in the
operation of its business and customs duties have not comprised
a material portion of the total cost of its products. In
addition, Coach is subject to foreign governmental regulation
and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against
certain prohibited foreign practices, with respect to its
product sourcing and international sales operations.

RISK FACTORS

You should consider carefully all of the
information set forth or incorporated by reference in this
document and, in particular, the following risk factors
associated with the Business of Coach and forward-looking
information in this document. Please also see “Special Note
on Forward-Looking Information” on page 3.

If Coach is unable to successfully
implement its growth strategies or manage its growing business,
its future operating results will suffer.

Successful implementation of Coach’s
strategies and initiatives will require it to manage its growth.
To manage growth effectively, Coach will need to continue to
increase its outsourced manufacturing while maintaining strict
quality control. Coach will also need to continue to improve its
operating systems to respond to any increased demand. It could
suffer a loss of consumer goodwill and a decline in sales if its
products do not continue to meet its quality control standards
or if it is unable to adequately respond to increases in
consumer demand for its products.

Coach’s inability to respond to
changes in consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely
manner could adversely affect its sales.

Coach’s success depends on its ability to
identify, originate and define product and fashion trends as
well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer
demands in a timely manner. Its products must appeal



to a broad range of consumers whose preferences
cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid
change. Coach cannot assure that it will be able to continue to
develop appealing styles or meet changing consumer demands in
the future.

If Coach misjudges the demand for its
products it may incur increased costs due to excess
inventories.

If Coach misjudges the market for its products it
may be faced with significant excess inventories for some
products and missed opportunities for other products. In
addition, because Coach places orders for products with its
manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers’
orders, it could experience higher excess inventories if
wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated.

Competition in the markets in which Coach
operates is intense, and our competitors may develop products
that are more popular with consumers.

Coach faces intense competition in the product
lines and markets in which it operates. Coach’s products
compete with other brands of products within their product
category and with private label products sold by retailers,
including some of Coach’s wholesale customers. In its
wholesale business, Coach competes with numerous manufacturers,
importers and distributors of handbags, accessories and other
products for the limited space available for the display of
these products to the consumer. Moreover, the general
availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants easy
access to the markets in which Coach operates, which may
increase the number of competitors and adversely affect its
competitive position and business. Finally, some of Coach’s
competitors have achieved significant recognition for their
brand names.

A downturn in the economy may affect
consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, which could
adversely affect Coach’s sales.

Many factors affect the level of consumer
spending in the handbag and luxury accessories industry,
including, among others, general business conditions, interest
rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and
consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Consumer
purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as Coach products,
tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable
income is lower. A downturn in the economies in which Coach
sells its products may adversely affect Coach’s sales.

Coach’s business is subject to foreign
exchange risk.

Coach sells products to its international
wholesale customers in U.S. dollars. However, those
distributors sell Coach product in the relevant local currency.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the
retail prices of the products and result in decreased
international demand.

The Company is exposed to market risk from
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to
Coach Japan as a result of its U.S. dollar-denominated
inventory purchases. In order to manage this risk, Coach Japan
enters into forward exchange contracts that allow them to obtain
dollars at a rate that is set concurrent with the requisition of
inventory. These contracts meet the definition of a derivative
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”. As these contracts are entered into before the
receipt of inventory, the contract rate may be higher or lower
than market rates when the goods are received and the payment is
completed. All contracts are fair valued at the end of the
reporting period. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow
hedge, effective subsequent changes in the fair value of the
derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are
recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged items
affect earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair
value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings
immediately. This non-cash charge or credit can result in
fluctuations in the reported financial results.

Coach consolidates the financial results of Coach
Japan into its financial statements. The functional currency of
Coach Japan is the Japanese yen. These operating results are
converted to U.S. dollars based on the average exchange
rate during the period and the balance sheet is converted to
U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the
reporting period.



If Coach loses key management or design
personnel or is unable to attract and retain the talent required
for its business, its operating results could
suffer.

Coach’s performance depends largely on the
efforts and abilities of its senior management and design teams.
These executives and employees have substantial experience and
expertise in Coach’s business and have made significant
contributions to its growth and success. Coach is a party to
employment agreements with certain executives which provide for
compensation and other benefits. The agreements also provide for
severance payments under certain circumstances. The unexpected
loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have
an adverse effect on Coach’s business. As the business
grows, Coach will need to attract and retain additional
qualified personnel and develop, train and manage an increasing
number of management-level, sales and other employees. Coach
cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain
personnel as needed in the future.

Coach’s operating results are subject
to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely
affect the market price of its common stock.

Because Coach products are frequently given as
gifts, Coach has historically realized, and expects to continue
to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second
quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of
November and December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and
operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the
timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events
affecting retail sales. However, over the past several years, we
have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday
quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations. We
expect that these trends will continue and that we will continue
to balance our year round business.

Coach’s gross profit may decrease if
it becomes unable to obtain its products from, or sell its
products in, other countries due to adverse international events
that are beyond its control.

In order to lower its sourcing costs and increase
its gross profit, Coach has shifted its production to
independent non-U.S. manufacturers in lower-cost markets.
Coach’s international manufacturers are subject to many
risks, including foreign governmental regulations, political
unrest, disruptions or delays in shipments, changes in local
economic conditions and trade issues. These factors, among
others, could influence the ability of these independent
manufacturers to make or export Coach products cost-effectively
or at all or to procure some of the materials used in these
products. The violation of labor or other laws by any of
Coach’s independent manufacturers, or the divergence of an
independent manufacturer’s labor practices from those
generally accepted as ethical by Coach or others in the U.S.,
could damage Coach’s reputation and force it to locate
alternative manufacturing sources. Currency exchange rate
fluctuations could increase the cost of raw materials for these
independent manufacturers, which they could pass along to Coach,
resulting in higher costs and decreased margins for its
products. If any of these factors were to render a particular
country undesirable or impractical as a source of supply, there
could be an adverse effect on Coach’s business, including
its gross profit.

Coach’s failure to continue to increase
sales of its products in international markets could adversely
affect its gross profit. International sales are subject to many
risks, including foreign governmental regulations, foreign
consumer preferences, political unrest, disruptions or delays in
shipments to other nations, tourism and changes in local
economic conditions. These factors, among others, could
influence Coach’s ability to sell products successfully in
international markets. Coach generally purchases products from
international manufacturers in U.S. dollars and sells these
products in the U.S. and to its international wholesale
customers in U.S. dollars. However, Coach’s
international wholesale customers sell Coach products in the
relevant local currencies, and currency exchange rate
fluctuations could adversely affect the retail prices of the
products and result in decreased international consumer demand.



Coach’s trademark and other
proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of
others and it may be inhibited from selling some of its
products. If Coach is unable to protect its trademarks and other
proprietary rights, others may sell imitation brand
products.

Coach believes that its registered and common law
trademarks and design patents are important to its ability to
create and sustain demand for Coach products. Coach cannot
assure you that it will not encounter trademark, patent or trade
dress disputes in the future as it expands its product line and
the geographic scope of its marketing. Coach also cannot assure
that the actions taken by it to establish and protect its
trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to
prevent imitation of its products or infringement of its
trademarks and proprietary rights by others. The laws of some
foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same
extent as do the laws of the U.S. and it may be more
difficult for Coach to successfully challenge the use of its
proprietary rights by other parties in these countries.

Provisions in Coach’s charter and
bylaws, Maryland law or its “poison pill” may delay or
prevent an acquisition of Coach by a third party.

Coach’s charter and bylaws and Maryland law
contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party
to acquire Coach without the consent of Coach’s Board of
Directors. Coach’s charter permits its Board of Directors,
without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase
or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the
number of shares of stock of any class or series that Coach has
the authority to issue. In addition, Coach’s Board of
Directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of
common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences,
rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares.
Although Coach’s Board of Directors has no intention to do
so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred
stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a transaction or a change in control that might
involve a premium price for Coach’s common stock or
otherwise be in the best interest of Coach’s stockholders.

On May 3, 2001 Coach declared a “poison
pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy additional
common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of
Coach’s common stock. Subject to limited exceptions, these
rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally
acquires 10% or more of Coach’s common stock or announces a
tender offer for 10% or more of the common stock on terms not
approved by the Coach Board of Directors. In this event, each
right would entitle the holder of each share of Coach’s
common stock to buy one additional common share of Coach stock
at an exercise price far below the then-current market price.
Subject to certain exceptions, Coach’s Board of Directors
will be entitled to redeem the rights at $0.001 per right
at any time before the close of business on the tenth day
following either the public announcement that, or the date on
which a majority of Coach’s Board of Directors becomes
aware that, a person has acquired 10% or more of the outstanding
common stock. As of the end of fiscal 2004, there were no
shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10%
threshold established by the rights plan.

Coach’s bylaws can only be amended by
Coach’s Board of Directors. Coach’s bylaws also
provide that nominations of persons for election to Coach’s
Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered
at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the
meeting, by Coach’s Board of Directors or by a stockholder
who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the
advance notice procedures of Coach’s bylaws. Also, under
Maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of
equity securities, between Coach and any person who beneficially
owns 10% or more of Coach’s common stock or an affiliate of
such person are prohibited for a five-year period unless
exempted in accordance with the statute. After this period, a
combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority
stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the
business combination is exempted by Coach’s Board of
Directors. Coach’s Board has exempted any business
combination with us or any of our affiliates from the five-year
prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements.

These and other provisions of Maryland law or
Coach’s charter and bylaws could have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in
control that might involve a premium price for Coach’s
common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of
Coach’s stockholders.



Item 2.

Properties

The following table sets forth the location, use
and size of Coach’s distribution, corporate and product
development facilities as of July 3, 2004, all of which are
leased. The leases expire at various times through 2016, subject
to renewal options.

As of July 3, 2004, Coach also occupies 174
retail and 76 factory leased stores located in North America.
Indirectly, through Coach Japan, Coach operates 100 department
store shop-in-shops, and retail and factory store locations in
Japan. Coach considers these properties to be in generally good
condition and believes that its facilities are adequate for its
operations and provide sufficient capacity to meet its
anticipated requirements.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

Coach is involved in various routine legal
proceedings as both plaintiff and defendant incident to the
ordinary course of its business, including proceedings to
protect Coach’s intellectual property rights, litigation
instituted by persons alleged to have been injured upon premises
within Coach’s control and litigation with present or
former employees. As part of its policing program for its
intellectual property rights, from time to time, Coach files
lawsuits in the U.S. and abroad alleging acts of trademark
counterfeiting, trademark infringement, patent infringement,
trade dress infringement, trademark dilution and/or state or
foreign law claims. At any given point in time, Coach may have
one or more of such actions pending. These actions often result
in seizure of counterfeit merchandise and/or out of court
settlements with defendants. From time to time, defendants will
raise as affirmative defenses or as counterclaims the invalidity
or unenforceability of certain of Coach’s intellectual
properties. Although Coach’s litigation with present or
former employees is routine and incidental to the conduct of
Coach’s business, as well as for any business employing
significant numbers of U.S.-based employees, such litigation can
result in large monetary awards when a civil jury is allowed to
determine compensatory and/or punitive damages for actions
claiming discrimination on the basis of age, gender, race,
religion, disability or other legally protected characteristic
or for termination of employment that is wrongful or in
violation of implied contracts. Coach believes, however, that
the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate
will not have a material adverse effect on Coach’s business
or consolidated financial statements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of Coach’s
financial condition and results of operations should be read
together with Coach’s financial statements and notes to
those statements included elsewhere in this document.

Executive Overview

Founded in 1941, Coach is a designer and marketer
of high-quality, modern American classic accessories.
Coach’s primary product offerings include handbags,
women’s and men’s accessories, business cases, weekend
and travel accessories, outerwear and related accessories.

Coach generates revenue by selling its products
directly to consumers, indirectly through wholesale customers
and Coach Japan, and by licensing its brand name to select
manufacturers. Direct-to-consumer sales consist of sales of
Coach products through its 174 Company-operated North American
retail stores, 76 Company-operated North American factory
stores, its on-line store and its catalogs. Indirect sales
consist of sales of Coach products to nearly 1,100 department
store locations in the United States, 115 international
department store, retail store, factory store and duty-free shop
locations in 17 countries and 100 department store
shop-in-shops, and retail and factory store locations managed by
its joint venture, Coach Japan, Inc. Coach generates additional
wholesale sales through business-to-business programs, in which
companies purchase Coach products to use as gifts or incentive
rewards. Licensing revenues consist of royalties paid to Coach
under licensing arrangements with select partners for the sale
of Coach branded watches, footwear, eyewear and office
furniture. Net sales were $1,321.1 million,
$953.2 million and $719.4 million, in fiscal 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively, representing a 38.6% increase in
fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 and a 32.5% increase in
fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. These net sales
increases were driven by growth across all distribution channels.

Coach’s cost of sales consists of the costs
associated with the sourcing of its products. Coach’s gross
profit is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes
in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes
in the mix of products sold, and fluctuations in material costs.
These factors, among others, may cause gross profit to fluctuate
from quarter to quarter. Gross profit increased to
$990.1 million in fiscal 2004, from $677.4 million in
fiscal 2003 and $483.4 million in fiscal 2002. Gross margin
increased to 74.9% in fiscal 2004, as compared to 71.1% in
fiscal 2003 and 67.2% in fiscal 2002, representing an increase
of 380 basis points in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal
2003 and 390 basis points in fiscal 2003 as compared to
fiscal 2002. These increases were primarily driven by the
factors discussed above.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
comprise four categories: selling; advertising, marketing and
design; distribution and customer service; and administration
and information services. Selling expenses include store
employee compensation, store occupancy costs, store supply
costs, wholesale account administration compensation and all
Coach Japan operating expenses. These expenses are affected by
the number of Coach and Coach Japan operated stores open during
any fiscal period and the related proportion of retail and
wholesale sales. Advertising, marketing and design expenses
include employee compensation, media space and production,
advertising agency fees, new product design costs, public
relations, market research expenses and mail order costs.
Distribution and customer services expenses include warehousing,
order fulfillment, shipping and handling, customer service and
bag repair costs. Administration and information services
expenses include compensation costs for the executive, finance,
human resources, legal and information systems departments, as
well as consulting and software expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increase as Coach and Coach Japan
operate more stores, although an increase in the number of
stores generally results in the fixed portion of selling,
general and administrative expenses being spread over a larger
sales base.



As part of Coach’s transformation from a
manufacturer to a marketer, in April 2002, Coach ceased
production at its Lares, Puerto Rico, manufacturing facility.
This reorganization, intended to reduce costs by transferring
production to lower cost third-party manufacturers, involved the
termination of 394 manufacturing, warehousing and management
employees at the Lares facility.

Operating income was $444.5 million,
$243.8 million and $133.6 million in fiscal 2004,
2003, and 2002, respectively. The 82.3% increase in fiscal 2004
from fiscal 2003 and 82.4% increase in fiscal 2003 from fiscal
2002 were both driven by the increases in net sales and gross
profit discussed previously, partially offset by increases in
selling, general and administrative expenses.

Net income was $261.7 million,
$146.6 million and $85.8 million in fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. In all fiscal years, the increases in
net income were primarily attributable to the increases in
operating income, discussed above, partially offset by higher
provisions for income taxes and higher minority interest charges.

Coach’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday
closest to June 30. Fiscal 2004 was 53-weeks, whereas
fiscal 2003 and 2002 were each 52-week periods. The
53rd week in fiscal 2004 contributed approximately
$19.5 million of additional net sales.

The following is a discussion of the results of
operations for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and fiscal
2002 as well as a discussion of the changes in financial
condition during fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2004
Compared to Fiscal 2003

Net Sales

Coach excludes new locations from the comparable
store base for the first year of operation. Similarly, stores
that are expanded by more than 15% are also excluded from the
comparable store base until the first anniversary of their
reopening. Stores that are closed for renovations are removed
from the comparable store base. In fiscal 2004, 53 weeks of
sales were reported and compared to the equivalent 53-week
period.

Direct.

Net sales increased 29.8% to
$726.5 million during fiscal 2004 from $559.5 million
in fiscal 2003, driven by increased comparable store sales, new
store sales and expanded store sales in our North American
retail and factory stores divisions. This net sales increase was
also driven by an additional week of sales, which represented
approximately $11.6 million of the total. Sales growth in
comparable stores was 21.9% for retail stores and 10.3% for
factory stores. Comparable store sales growth for the entire
North American store chain was 16.9%, which accounted for
$95.7 million of the net sales increase. Since the end of
fiscal 2003, Coach has opened 19 retail stores and two factory
stores. Sales from these new stores, as well as the
noncomparable portion of sales from stores opened during fiscal
2003, accounted for $53.0 million of the net sales
increase. Since the end of fiscal 2003, Coach also expanded nine
retail stores. Sales from these expanded stores, as well as the
noncomparable portion of sales from stores expanded during
fiscal 2003, accounted for $15.3 million of the net sales
increase. Sales growth in the Internet business accounted for
the remaining sales increase. These increases were slightly
offset by a decline in the direct marketing channel and store
closures. Since the end of fiscal 2003, Coach has closed one
retail store and two factory stores.

Indirect.

Net
sales increased 51.0% to $594.6 million in fiscal 2004 from
$393.7 million during fiscal 2003. The increase was
primarily driven by growth at our Japanese joint venture, Coach
Japan, Inc. in which net sales increased $100.4 million
over the comparable period of the prior year, including
$4.1 million of sales during the additional week of the
fiscal year. Since the end of fiscal 2003, we have opened eight
locations in Japan. Sales from these new stores, as well as the
noncomparable portion of sales from stores opened during fiscal
2003, accounted for $44.0 million of the net sales
increase. Our Japan locations experienced double-digit
comparable net sales gains from the prior year, which
represented $33.3 million of the net sales increase. Since
the end of fiscal 2003, we have also expanded 16 locations in
Japan, which accounted for $7.3 million of the net sales
increase. Finally, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates
resulted in an increase in reported net sales of
$21.7 million. These net sales increases were slightly
offset by store closures. Since the end of fiscal 2003, Coach
Japan has closed one location. The increase in indirect net
sales was also driven by growth in the U.S. wholesale,
international wholesale and business-to-business divisions,
which contributed increased sales of $37.5 million,
$33.5 million and $22.0 million, respectively, as
compared to the same period in the prior year. The remaining net
sales increase is attributable to increases in other indirect
channels.

Gross
Profit

Gross profit increased 46.2% to
$990.1 million in fiscal 2004 from $677.4 million in
fiscal 2003. Gross margin increased 380 basis points to 74.9% in
fiscal 2004 from 71.1% in fiscal 2003. This improvement was
driven by: a shift in channel mix, as our higher gross margin
channels grew faster than the business as a whole,



which contributed approximately 140 additional
basis points; a shift in product mix, reflecting increased
penetration of higher margin mixed material product and
accessories, which contributed approximately 120 additional
basis points; and the continuing impact of sourcing cost
initiatives, which contributed approximately 120 additional
basis points.

The following chart illustrates the gross margin
performance we have experienced over the last 12 quarters:

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased 25.8% to $545.6 million in fiscal 2004 from
$433.7 million in fiscal 2003. The dollar increase was
caused primarily by increased variable expenses related to Coach
Japan, increased variable expenses to support increased net
sales, and increased store operating expenses attributable to
new stores opened both domestically and in Japan, as compared to
the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general
and administrative expenses during fiscal 2004 were 41.3%
compared to 45.5% during fiscal 2003. This improvement was due
to leveraging our expense base on higher sales.

Selling expenses increased 31.0% to
$386.2 million, or 29.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from
$294.9 million, or 30.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The
dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to an
increase in operating expenses associated with Coach Japan and
operating expenses associated with North American stores that
were opened during and after the end of fiscal 2003. The
increase in Coach Japan expenses was $42.8 million, driven
by new stores operating expenses, increased variable expenses
related to higher sales, and the nonrecurrence of a
$3.4 million favorable fair value adjustment for open
foreign currency forward contracts. In addition, the impact of
foreign currency exchange rates increased reported expenses by
$10.0 million. Domestically, Coach has opened 19 new retail
stores and two new factory stores since the end of fiscal 2003.
Expenses from these new stores, as well as the noncomparable
portion of expenses from stores opened in fiscal 2003, increased
total expenses by $16.2 million. The remaining increase in
selling expenses was due to increased variable expenses to
support sales growth.

Advertising, marketing, and design costs
increased by 10.8% to $63.5 million, or 4.8% of net sales,
in fiscal 2004, from $57.3 million, or 6.0% of net sales,
in fiscal 2003. This dollar increase was primarily due to
increased staffing costs and increased design expenditures.

Distribution and customer service expenses
increased to $32.4 million in fiscal 2004 from
$29.7 million in fiscal 2003. The dollar increase in these
expenses was primarily due to higher sales volumes. However,
efficiency gains at the distribution and customer service
facility resulted in an improvement in the ratio of these
expenses to net sales from 3.1% in fiscal 2003 to 2.5% in fiscal
2004.

Administrative expenses increased 22.6% to
$63.5 million, or 4.8% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from
$51.8 million, or 5.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. The
dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased
compensation costs as well as increased professional and
consulting fees. These increases were offset by an increase in
business interruption proceeds of $1.2 million, related to
our World Trade Center location.

Interest
Income, Net

Net interest income was $3.2 million in
fiscal 2004, as compared to $1.1 million in fiscal 2003.
This dollar change was due to increased positive cash balances
during fiscal 2004 as well as higher returns on investments.
During fiscal 2004, Coach began investing in marketable
securities with maturities greater than 90 days, which
yielded greater rates of return.



Provision
for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate increased to 37.5% in
fiscal 2004 compared with the 37.0% recorded in fiscal 2003.

Minority
Interest

Minority interest expense, net of tax, increased
to $18.0 million, or 1.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from
$7.6 million, or 0.8% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This
increase was due to increased profits from the operations of
Coach Japan and the impact of a stronger yen.

Fiscal 2003
Compared to Fiscal 2002

Net Sales

Direct.

Net sales increased 25.1% to
$559.5 million during fiscal 2003, from $447.1 million
in fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales growth for retail stores
and factory stores open for one full year was 24.6% and 5.0%,
respectively. Comparable store growth for the entire domestic
store chain was 15.2%, which represented approximately
$62 million of the net sales increase. Since the end of
fiscal 2002, Coach opened 20 retail stores and three factory
stores, expanded four retail and five factory stores and had
wrap from fiscal 2002 openings, which accounted for
approximately $45 million of the increase in net sales. The
Internet and direct marketing businesses accounted for the
remaining sales increase. The increase in net sales was
partially offset by the two retail stores and one factory store
that were closed since the end of fiscal 2002.

Indirect.

Net
sales increased 44.6% to $393.7 million in fiscal 2003 from
$272.3 million during fiscal 2002. The increase was
primarily driven by Coach Japan, in which net sales increased
$89.4 million over the prior year. We opened 14 locations
in Japan since the end of fiscal 2002, which represented
approximately $42 million of the increase. Our Japan
locations experienced double-digit net sales gains in comparable
locations over the prior year, which represented approximately
$30 million of the increase. In addition, fiscal 2002 only
included 11 months of Coach Japan operations, while fiscal
2003 included a full year. In the third quarter of fiscal 2002,
Coach Japan acquired the distribution rights and assets of
J. Osawa. The effect of the incremental month of operations
and acquisition of J. Osawa locations represented
approximately $19 million of the increase in net sales.
These increases were partially offset by the closure of four
locations since the end of fiscal 2002. This decrease was
approximately $2 million. The U.S. wholesale and
business-to-business divisions contributed increased sales of
$21.3 million and $8.3 million, respectively. The
increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased net
sales in the international wholesale division of
$1.3 million. The remaining change in net sales was due to
increases in other indirect channels.

Gross
Profit

Gross profit increased 40.1% to
$677.4 million in fiscal 2003 from $483.4 million in
fiscal 2002. Gross margin increased 390 basis points to 71.1% in
fiscal 2003 from 67.2% in fiscal 2002. This improvement was
primarily driven by a shift in product mix reflecting the
continued diversification into new and successful fabric and
leather collections, which contributed approximately
140 basis points. There were sourcing cost initiatives,
which contributed approximately 120 basis points. In addition,
there was a shift in channel mix, which contributed
approximately 100 basis points. The remaining improvement was
driven primarily by the consolidation of Coach Japan.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased 25.2% to $433.7 million in fiscal 2003 from
$346.4 million in fiscal 2002. The dollar increase was
caused primarily by increased operating expenses in Coach Japan
and the U.S. stores. These increased expenses were due to new
stores and variable expenses to support increased net sales.
Fiscal 2002 selling, general and administrative expenses
included 11 months of Coach Japan, while fiscal 2003
included a full year. As a percentage of net sales, selling,
general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2003 were
45.5% compared to 48.1% during fiscal 2002. This improvement was
due to leveraging our expense base on higher sales.



Selling expenses increased by 28.6% to
$294.9 million in fiscal 2003 from $229.3 million in
fiscal 2002. The dollar increase in these expenses was primarily
due to the operating costs associated with Coach Japan and
operating costs associated with new retail and factory stores.
Fiscal 2002 expenses included 11 months of Coach Japan,
while fiscal 2003 included a full year. The increase in Coach
Japan expenses was $34.6 million. Included in the current
year costs was a $3.4 million favorable fair value
adjustment for foreign currency forward contracts, compared to a
$3.3 million unfavorable fair value adjustment in fiscal
2002. Domestically, Coach opened 20 new retail stores and three
new factory stores since the end of fiscal 2002. The increase in
the U.S. stores expense was $28.1 million. The remaining
increase to selling expenses was due to increased variable
expenses to support comparable store growth. As a percentage of
net sales, selling expenses improved from 31.9% in fiscal 2002
to 30.9% in fiscal 2003. The decline was due to leveraging
higher sales in the domestic stores division.

Advertising, marketing, and design costs
increased by 10.8% to $57.3 million, or 6.0% of net sales,
in fiscal 2003, from $51.7 million, or 7.2% of net sales,
in fiscal 2002. The dollar increase was primarily due to
increased staffing costs and increased design expenditures.

Distribution and customer service expenses
increased to $29.7 million in fiscal 2003 from
$26.9 million in fiscal 2002. The dollar increase in these
expenses was primarily due to higher sales volumes. However,
efficiency gains at the distribution and customer service
facility resulted in a decline in the ratio to net sales from
3.7% in fiscal 2002 to 3.1% in fiscal 2003.

Administrative expenses increased by 34.5% to
$51.8 million, or 5.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from
$38.5 million, or 5.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. The
absolute dollar increase in these expenses was due in part to
increased total compensation cost of approximately $8 million.
The increase was due primarily to increased base salary and
employment agreements with certain executives, which accounted
for $9 million of the increase. The increase was partially
offset by decreased temporary employee costs. There were higher
occupancy costs of approximately $2 million associated with
the full year impact of acquiring additional space in our New
York City headquarters. Insurance settlement proceeds decreased
approximately $2 million due to the nonrecurrence of store
inventory and fixed asset recoveries relating to our World Trade
Center location.

Reorganization
Costs

In March 2002, Coach ceased production at its
Lares, Puerto Rico, manufacturing facility. This reorganization
involved the termination of 394 manufacturing, warehousing and
management employees and the disposition of the fixed assets at
the Lares facility. These actions were intended to reduce costs
by the resulting transfer of production to lower cost
third-party manufacturers. Coach recorded a reorganization cost
of $3.4 million. The reorganization cost included
$2.2 million for worker separation costs, $0.7 million
for lease termination costs and $0.5 million for the
write-down of long-lived assets to net realizable value.

Interest
Income, Net

Net interest income was $1.1 million in
fiscal 2003, as compared to an expense of $0.3 million in
fiscal 2002. The dollar change was due to reduced borrowings and
positive cash balances during fiscal 2003.

Provision
for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate increased to 37.0% in
fiscal 2003 compared with the 35.5% recorded in fiscal 2002.
This increase was due in part to the closure of our facility in
Lares, Puerto Rico and the elimination of related tax benefits.

Minority
Interest

Minority interest, net of tax, increased to
$7.6 million, or 0.8% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from
$0.2 million in fiscal 2002. The dollar change was due to
increased profitability in Coach Japan coupled with a stronger
yen.



FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and Capital
    Resources

Net cash provided from operating activities was
$448.6 million in fiscal 2004 compared to
$221.6 million in fiscal 2003. This $227.0 million
increase was primarily the result of increased earnings of
$115.1 million and increased tax benefit from the exercise
of stock options of $65.0 million.

Net cash used in investment activities was
$369.4 million in fiscal 2004 compared to
$57.1 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in net cash used
in investment activities is primarily attributable to the
$301.7 million purchase of investments. During fiscal 2004,
Coach began investing in marketable securities with maturities
greater than 90 days, in order to maximize the rate of
return on our investments. In addition, capital expenditures
also increased by $10.6 million, which related primarily to
new and renovated retail stores in the United States and Japan
as well as technology enhancements. Coach’s future capital
expenditures will depend on the timing and rate of expansion of
our businesses, new store openings, store renovations and
international expansion opportunities.

Net cash used in financing activities was
$45.7 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $29.3 million
in fiscal 2003. The $16.4 million increase in cash used
resulted from an additional $17.1 million of repayments
related to Coach Japan’s credit facilities and an
additional $5.0 million of funds expended to repurchase
common stock, offset by an additional $5.7 million of
proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.

On October 16, 2003, Coach, certain lenders
and Fleet National Bank (“Fleet”), as primary lender
and administrative agent, renewed the $100 million senior
unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Fleet
facility”), extending the facility expiration to
October 16, 2006. At Coach’s request, the Fleet
facility can be expanded to $125 million, and, during the
first two years of its term, the expiration can be extended for
one additional year, to October 16, 2007. Indebtedness
under this revolving credit facility bears interest calculated,
at Coach’s option, at either a rate of LIBOR plus a margin
or the prime rate announced by Fleet. This facility is available
for seasonal working capital requirements or general corporate
purposes. The facility may be prepaid without penalty or premium.

During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 there were no
borrowings under the Fleet facility. As of July 3, 2004,
there were no outstanding borrowings under the Fleet facility.

Under this revolving credit facility, Coach pays
a commitment fee of 12.5 to 30 basis points, based on the
Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio, on any unused
amounts of the revolving credit facility. The initial commitment
fee was 30 basis points. At July 3, 2004, the commitment
fee was 15 basis points. The initial LIBOR margin under the
facility was 125 basis points. At July 3, 2004, the LIBOR
margin was 62.5 basis points, reflecting an improvement in our
fixed-charge coverage ratio.

The Fleet facility contains various covenants and
customary events of default. Coach has been in compliance with
all covenants since its inception.

To provide funding for working capital and
general corporate purposes, Coach Japan entered into credit
facilities with several Japanese financial institutions. These
facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 8.6 billion yen or
approximately $79 million at July 3, 2004. Interest is
based on the Tokyo Interbank rate plus a margin of up to 50
basis points.

During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, the peak
borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities were
$36.1 million and $43.4 million, respectively. At
July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, outstanding borrowings
under the Japanese facilities were $1.7 million and
$26.5 million, respectively.

These Japanese facilities contain various
covenants and customary events of default. Coach Japan has been
in compliance with all covenants since their inception. These
facilities include automatic renewals based on compliance with
the covenants. Coach, Inc. is not a guarantor on these
facilities.

The Coach Board of Directors has authorized the
establishment of a common stock repurchase program. Under this
program, up to $180 million may be utilized to repurchase
Coach’s outstanding common stock. Purchases of Coach stock
may be made from time to time, subject to market conditions and
at prevailing



market prices, through open market purchases.
Repurchased shares will be retired and may be reissued in the
future for general corporate or other uses. This stock
repurchase program expires in January 2006. The Company may
terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time.

During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, Coach
repurchased 1.5 million and 3.9 million shares,
respectively, of common stock, at an average cost of $36.36 and
$12.95 per share, respectively. As of July 3, 2004, Coach
had approximately $65 million remaining in the stock
repurchase program.

On August 12, 2004, the Coach Board of
Directors approved a $200 million increase to the
Company’s existing common stock repurchase program and
extended the duration of this program through August 2006.

During August 2004, the Company repurchased
2.4 million shares of common stock at an average cost of
$39.06 per share. These stock repurchases of approximately
$95 million were financed from cash on hand. As of
September 4, 2004, Coach had expended approximately
$210 million of the $380 million authorized to date
under the stock repurchase program.

In fiscal 2004, total capital expenditures were
$67.7 million. Coach opened 19 new retail and two new
factory stores in North America, which represented
$19.5 million of capital expenditures, as well as expanded
nine stores, which represented $11.8 million of capital
expenditures. Spending on department store renovations and
distributor locations was $3.9 million. In addition,
$16.5 million was used for information systems and
corporate facilities. These investments were financed from
internally generated cash flows and on hand cash. In Japan, we
invested $16.0 million, primarily for the opening of eight
new locations, store expansions and information systems. These
investments were financed by using funds from our Japanese
revolving credit facilities and operating cash flow.

Coach experiences significant seasonal variations
in its working capital requirements. During the first fiscal
quarter Coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season,
opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade
receivables. In the second fiscal quarter its working capital
requirements are reduced substantially as Coach generates
consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable. In
fiscal 2004, Coach purchased approximately $349 million of
inventory, which was funded by on hand cash, operating cash flow
and by borrowings under the Japanese revolving credit facilities.

Management believes that cash flow from
operations and on hand cash will provide adequate funds for the
foreseeable working capital needs, planned capital expenditures
and the common stock repurchase program. Any future
acquisitions, joint ventures or other similar transactions may
require additional capital. There can be no assurance that any
such capital will be available to Coach on acceptable terms or
at all. Coach’s ability to fund its working capital needs,
planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments, as
well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its
debt agreements, depends on its future operating performance and
cash flow, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic
conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of
which are beyond Coach’s control.

Currently, Sara Lee is a guarantor or a party to
many of Coach’s leases. Coach has agreed to make efforts to
remove Sara Lee from all of its existing leases, and Sara Lee is
not a guarantor or a party to any new or renewed leases. Coach
has obtained a letter of credit for the benefit of Sara Lee in
an amount approximately equal to the annual minimum rental
payments under leases transferred to Coach by Sara Lee, but for
which Sara Lee retains contingent liability. Coach is required
to maintain this letter of credit until the annual minimum
rental payments under the relevant leases are less than
$2.0 million. The initial letter of credit had a face
amount of $20.6 million, and we expect this amount to
decrease annually as Coach’s guaranteed obligations are
reduced. As of July 3, 2004, the letter of credit was
$16.8 million. We expect that we will be required to
maintain the letter of credit for at least 10 years.



As of July 3, 2004, the scheduled maturities
of Coach’s long-term contractual obligations are as follows:

Coach does not have any off-balance-sheet
financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
Coach’s risk management policies prohibit the use of
derivatives for trading purposes. The valuation of financial
instruments that are marked-to-market are based upon independent
third-party sources.

Long-Term
Debt

Coach is party to an Industrial Revenue Bond
related to its Jacksonville, Florida facility. This loan has a
remaining balance of $3.5 million and bears interest at
8.77%. Principal and interest payments are made semiannually,
with the final payment due in 2014.

Seasonality

Because its products are frequently given as
gifts, Coach has historically realized, and expects to continue
to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second
quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of
November and December. In addition, fluctuations in sales and
operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the
timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events
affecting retail sales. However, over the past several years, we
have achieved higher levels of growth in the nonholiday
quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations. We
expect that these trends will continue and we will further
balance our year round business.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an
imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment.
Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be
material to the financial statements. The accounting policies
discussed below are considered critical because changes to
certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies
could affect the financial statements.

In certain instances, accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America allow for the
selection of alternative accounting methods. The Company’s
significant policies that involve the selection of alternative
methods are accounting for stock options and inventories.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Two alternative methods for accounting for stock
options are available: the intrinsic value method and the fair
value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of
accounting for stock options and, accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized. Under either method, the
determination of the pro forma amounts involves several
assumptions including option life and future volatility. See
Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
expanded disclosures.

Inventories

U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(determined by the first-in, first-out method) or market.
Inventories in Japan are valued at the lower of cost (determined
by the last-in, first-out method) or market.



Inventory costs include material, conversion
costs, freight and duties. Reserves for slow moving and aged
merchandise are provided based on historical experience and
current product demand. We evaluate the adequacy of reserves
quarterly. A decrease in product demand due to changing customer
tastes, buying patterns or increased competition could impact
Coach’s evaluation of its slow moving and aged merchandise.

For more information on Coach’s accounting
policies please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Other critical accounting policies are as follows:

Valuation of
Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” which the Company adopted effective with the
beginning of fiscal 2002, the Company assesses the carrying
value of its long-lived assets for possible impairment based on
a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the
profitability of the related business. The Company did not
record any impairment losses in fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2003. See
Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for long-lived
asset write-downs recorded in connection with the Company’s
fiscal 2002 reorganization plan.

Revenue
Recognition

Sales are recognized at the point of sale, which
occurs when merchandise is sold in an over-the-counter consumer
transaction or, for the wholesale channels, upon shipment of
merchandise, when title passes to the customer. Allowances for
estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and
allowances are provided when sales are recorded based upon
historical experience and current trends. Royalty revenues are
earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other
consumer products that incorporate the Coach brand. Revenue
earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported
net sales from the licensee.

New
Accounting Standards

During fiscal 2004, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”, which
amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” SFAS No. 148 provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value
based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. As the Company does not expense stock options, the
adoption of this statement did not have an impact on
Coach’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require more prominent and
more frequent disclosures in financial statements of the effects
of stock-based compensation. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for these expanded disclosures.

In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” to amend and clarify financial
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 requires that
contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for
similarly and clarifies under what circumstances a contract with
an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a
derivative as discussed in SFAS No. 133. In addition, it
clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that
warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS
No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified
after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships
designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS
No. 149 did not have an impact on Coach’s financial
position or results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS
No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies
and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics
of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer
classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a
liability (or an asset in some circumstances). The provisions of
SFAS No. 150 are effective for financial instruments
entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise
is effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning



after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS
No. 150 did not have an impact on Coach’s financial
position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits”. This
statement revises employers’ disclosures about pension
plans and other postretirement benefits. However, it does not
change the measurement or recognition of those plans, as
previously required by SFAS No. 87, “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions”, No. 88,
“Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
Termination Benefits”, and No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions”. In addition to the disclosure
requirements contained in SFAS No. 132, the revised
statement requires additional disclosures about the assets,
obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of
defined benefit pension plans and other defined postretirement
plans. See Note 9, “Retirement Plans,” for these
additional disclosures.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) reached consensus on EITF 03-1,
“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments”. EITF 03-1
provides guidance on the new requirements for
other-than-temporary impairment and its application to debt and
marketable equity investments that are accounted for under SFAS
No. 115. The new requirements on disclosures are effective
for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The
implementation of EITF 03-1 did not have an impact on
Coach’s financial position or results of operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

The market risk inherent in our financial
instruments represents the potential loss in fair value,
earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest
rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Coach manages these
exposures through operating and financing activities and, when
appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments
with respect to Coach Japan. The following quantitative
disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through
independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of
financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying
terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. These
quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible
loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results
may differ from those estimates.

Foreign
Exchange

Foreign currency exposures arise from
transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated
contracts, denominated in a currency other than the
entity’s functional currency, and from foreign-denominated
revenues translated into U.S. dollars.

Approximately 98% of Coach’s fiscal 2004
non-licensed product needs were purchased from independent
manufacturers in countries other than the United States. These
countries include China, Turkey, India, Costa Rica, Dominican
Republic, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Philippines,
Singapore, Spain, Taiwan and Thailand. Additionally, sales are
made through international channels to third party distributors.
Substantially all purchases and sales involving international
parties, excluding Coach Japan, are denominated in
U.S. dollars and, therefore, are not hedged by Coach using
any derivative instruments.

Coach is exposed to market risk from foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to Coach Japan
as a result of its U.S. dollar denominated inventory
purchases. The Company, through Coach Japan, enters into certain
foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily foreign
exchange forward contracts, to manage these risks. These
transactions are in accordance with Coach’s risk management
policies. Coach does not enter into derivative transactions for
speculative or trading purposes. The Company is also exposed to
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the
euro-denominated expenses of its Italian sourcing office. During
fiscal 2003, Coach began a program to enter into certain foreign
currency derivative contracts, primarily foreign exchange
forward contracts, in order to manage these fluctuations.
However, during fiscal 2004, we reassessed this program and
determined, based on current business conditions, that we would
discontinue hedging against the euro.



The foreign currency contracts entered into by
the Company have durations no greater than 12 months. The
fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in
accrued liabilities at July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003
were $0.5 million and $0, respectively. The fair value of
open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at
July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003 was $0 and
$0.4 million, respectively. As of July 3, 2004, open
foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges, with a
notional amount of $63.6 million, were fair valued,
resulting in a reduction to equity as a charge to other
comprehensive income of $0.5 million, net of taxes. As of
June 28, 2003, open foreign currency forward contracts
designated as hedges, with a notional amount of
$39.3 million, respectively, were fair valued, resulting in
an increase to equity as a benefit to other comprehensive income
of $0.2 million, net of taxes. Also, during fiscal 2003,
open foreign currency forward contracts not designated as
hedges, with a notional amount of $33.2 million, were fair
valued and resulted in a pretax non cash benefit to earnings of
$3.4 million, included as a component of selling, general
and administrative expenses.

Interest
Rate

Coach faces minimal interest rate risk exposure
in relation to its outstanding debt of $5.2 million at
July 3, 2004. Of this amount, $1.7 million, under
revolving credit facilities, is subject to interest rate
fluctuations. A hypothetical 1% change in the interest rate
applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material
impact on earnings or cash flows of Coach.

Controls and Procedures

Based on the evaluation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures as of July 3, 2004, each
of Lew Frankfort, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
and Michael F. Devine, III, the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company, has concluded that the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules
and forms.

Based on an evaluation by management, with the
participation of Messrs. Frankfort and Devine, there was no
change in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the Company’s fourth fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably like to
materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Coach, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Coach, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of July 3, 2004 and June 28,
2003 and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended July 3, 2004. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of July 3, 2004 and
June 28, 2003, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
July 3, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

Nature of Operations and Significant
    Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations

Coach, Inc. (the “Company”) designs,
produces and markets high-quality, modern American classic
accessories. The Company’s primary product offerings,
manufactured by third-party suppliers, include handbags,
women’s and men’s accessories, business cases, weekend
and travel accessories, outerwear and related accessories.
Coach’s products are sold through direct-to-consumer
channels, including Company-operated retail and factory stores,
its on-line store and its catalogs, as well as through indirect
channels, including department store locations in the United
States, international department, retail and duty-free shop
locations as well as department store shop-in-shops, and retail
and factory store locations operated by Coach Japan, Inc.

Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the
Saturday closest to June 30. Unless otherwise stated,
references to years in the financial statements relate to fiscal
years. The fiscal year ended July 3, 2004 (“fiscal
2004”) was a 53-week period, whereas the fiscal years ended
June 28, 2003 (“fiscal 2003”) and June 29,
2002 (“fiscal 2002”) were each 52-week periods.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases
with the length of time until the underlying transactions are
completed. Actual results could differ from estimates in amounts
that may be material to the financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company, all 100% owned subsidiaries and Coach
Japan. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash
balances and highly liquid investments with a maturity of less
than 90 days.

Investments

Investments consist of U.S. government and
agency debt securities as well as municipal government and
corporate debt securities. These securities are classified as
held to maturity, as the Company has both the ability and the
intent to hold these securities until maturity. Investments are
recorded at amortized cost. Premiums are amortized and discounts
are accreted over the lives of the related securities as
adjustments to interest income, using the effective interest
method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially expose
Coach to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash
investments and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash
investments with high-credit quality financial institutions and
currently invests primarily in U.S. government and agency
debt securities, municipal government and corporate debt
securities, and bank money market funds placed with major banks
and financial institutions. Accounts receivable is generally
diversified due to the number of entities comprising
Coach’s customer base and their dispersion across many
geographical regions. The Company’s allowance for bad
debts, returns and allowances was $5,456 at July 3, 2004
and $6,095 at June 28, 2003. The Company believes no
significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to
these cash investments and accounts receivable.

Inventories

Inventories consist primarily of finished goods.
U.S. inventories are valued at the lower of cost
(determined by the first-in, first-out method
(“FIFO”)) or market. Inventories in Japan are valued
at the lower of cost (determined by the last-in, first-out
method (“LIFO”)) or market. At the end of fiscal 2004
and fiscal 2003, inventories recorded at LIFO were $2,409 and
$650 higher, respectively, than if they were valued at FIFO.
Inventories valued under LIFO amounted to $34,508 and $23,484 in
fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Inventory costs include
material, conversion costs, freight and duties.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Machinery and equipment are depreciated over lives of
five to seven years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated
over lives of three to five years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
the related lease terms. Maintenance and repair costs are
charged to earnings as incurred while expenditures for major
renewals and improvements are capitalized. Upon the disposition
of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets

The Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, effective with
the beginning of fiscal 2002. In accordance with
SFAS No. 142, the Company’s goodwill account is
no longer amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Based
on this annual evaluation, the Company has concluded that there
is no impairment of its goodwill or indefinite life intangible
assets.

Valuation of Long-Lived
    Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” which the Company adopted effective with the
beginning of fiscal 2002, the Company assesses the carrying
value of its long-lived assets for possible impairment based on
a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the
profitability of the related business. The Company did not
record any impairment losses in fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2003. See
Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
long-lived asset write-downs recorded in connection with the
Company’s fiscal 2002 reorganization plan.



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

Minority Interest in
    Subsidiary

Minority interest in the statements of income
represents Sumitomo Corporation’s share of the equity in
Coach Japan. The minority interest in the consolidated balance
sheets reflects the original investment by Sumitomo in that
consolidated subsidiary, along with their proportional share of
the cumulative income, net of tax.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized at the point of sale, which
occurs when merchandise is sold in an over-the-counter consumer
transaction or, for the wholesale channels, upon shipment of
merchandise, when title passes to the customer. Allowances for
estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and
allowances are provided when sales are recorded. Royalty
revenues are earned through license agreements with
manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the
Coach brand. Revenue earned under these contracts is recognized
based upon reported sales from the licensee.

Advertising

Advertising costs, which include media and
production, totaled $21,574, $19,885 and $17,279 in fiscal years
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are included in selling,
general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs are
expensed when the advertising first appears.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling costs incurred were
$13,080, $11,290, and $10,694 in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively and are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes.” Under SFAS No. 109, a deferred tax
liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
and their respective tax bases.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s stock-based compensation plans
and the employee stock purchase plan, as more fully described in
Note 8, “Stock-Based Compensation” are accounted
for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related Interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation cost is recognized for stock options and
replacement stock options issued under stock-based compensation
plans or for shares purchased under the employee stock purchase
plan. The compensation cost that has been charged against
income, reflecting amortization of restricted stock units, was
$4,410, $1,568 and $766 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The following illustrates the effect on net

share data)

income and earnings per share as if the fair
value based method of accounting, defined in
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation”, had been applied:

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

The fair value of the revolving credit facility
at July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003 approximated its
carrying value due to its floating interest rates. The Company
has evaluated its Industrial Revenue Bond and believes, based on
the interest rate, related term and maturity, that the fair
value of such instrument approximates its carrying amount. As of
July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, the carrying values of
cash and cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities
approximated their values due to the short-term maturities of
these accounts. See Note 7, “Investments,” for
the fair values of the Company’s investments as of
July 3, 2004.

Coach, through Coach Japan, enters into foreign
currency forward contracts that hedge certain U.S. dollar
denominated inventory risk, that have been designated for hedge
accounting. The fair value of these contracts is recognized in
other comprehensive income. The fair value of the foreign
currency derivative is based on its market value as determined
by an independent party. However, considerable judgment is
required in developing estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the
estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts that Coach could settle in a current market exchange.
The use of different market assumptions or methodologies could
affect the estimated fair value.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of the Company’s
foreign operations is the applicable local currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the
current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date,
while revenues and expenses are translated at the
weighted-average exchange rates for the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within
stockholders’ equity. Translation adjustment gains in
fiscal 2004 were $2,892 compared to translation adjustment
losses in fiscal 2003 of $348. Translation adjustment gains in
fiscal 2002 were $396.



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share was calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share was
calculated similarly but includes potential dilution from the
exercise of stock options and stock awards.

Stock Split

In May 2002, Coach’s Board of Directors
authorized a two-for-one split of the Company’s common
stock, to be effected in the form of a special dividend of one
share of the Company’s common stock for each share
outstanding. The additional shares issued as a result of the
stock split were distributed on July 3, 2002 to
stockholders of record on June 19, 2002.

In August 2003, Coach’s Board of Directors
authorized a two-for-one split of the Company’s common
stock, to be effected in the form of a special dividend of one
share of the Company’s common stock for each share
outstanding. The additional shares issued as a result of the
stock split were distributed on October 1, 2003 to
stockholders of record on September 17, 2003.

The effect of these stock splits on the number of
shares and earnings per share was retroactively applied to all
periods presented.

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

During fiscal 2004, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”, which
amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” SFAS No. 148 provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value
based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. As the Company does not expense stock options, the
adoption of this statement did not have an impact on
Coach’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require more prominent
and more frequent disclosures in financial statements of the
effects of stock-based compensation. See above,
“Stock-Based Compensation,” for these expanded
disclosures.

In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities,” to amend and clarify financial
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts and for hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149
requires that contracts with comparable characteristics be
accounted for similarly and clarifies under what circumstances a
contract with an initial net investment meets the
characteristics of a derivative as discussed in
SFAS No. 133. In addition, it clarifies when a
derivative contains a financing component that warrants special
reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated
after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149
did not have an impact on Coach’s financial position or
results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and
Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for
how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that
is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some
circumstances). The provisions of SFAS No. 150 are
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did
not have an impact on Coach’s financial position or results
of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits”. This statement revises employers’
disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement
benefits. However, it does not change the measurement or
recognition of those plans, as previously required by
SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions”, No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting
for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension
Plans and for Termination Benefits” and No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions”. In addition to the disclosure
requirements contained in SFAS No. 132, the revised
statement requires additional disclosures about the assets,
obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined
benefit pension plans and other defined postretirement plans.
See Note 9, “Retirement Plans,” for these
additional disclosures.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) reached consensus on EITF 03-1,
“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Investments”.
EITF 03-1 provides guidance on the new requirements for
other-than-temporary impairment and its application to debt and
marketable equity investments that are accounted for under
SFAS No. 115. The new requirements on disclosures are
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003.
The implementation of EITF 03-1 did not have an impact on
Coach’s financial position or results of operations.

respective year-ends were as follows:

At July 3, 2004, state gross tax loss
carryforwards totaled approximately $24,945. These loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2008.

The Company has received tax benefit from the
exercise of stock options. This benefit is reflected as a credit
to stockholders’ equity and not reflected in the provision
for income taxes. The amount of this benefit was $106,458,
$41,503 and $13,793 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Debt

Revolving Credit Facilities

On February 27, 2001, Coach, certain lenders
and Fleet National Bank (“Fleet”), as primary lender
and administrative agent, entered into a $100,000 senior
unsecured three-year revolving credit facility (the “Fleet
facility”). On October 16, 2003, this facility was
renewed, extending the facility expiration to October 16,
2006. At Coach’s request, the Fleet facility can be
expanded to $125,000 and, during the first two years of its



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

term, the expiration date can be extended for one
additional year, to October 16, 2007. This facility is
available for seasonal working capital requirements or general
corporate purposes and may be prepaid without penalty or premium.

During fiscal 2004 and 2003, there were no
borrowings under the Fleet facility. As of July 3, 2004,
there were no outstanding borrowings under the Fleet facility.

Coach pays a commitment fee of 12.5 to
30 basis points based on any unused amounts of the Fleet
facility. The initial commitment fee was 30 basis points.
At July 3, 2004, the commitment fee was 15 basis
points. The initial LIBOR margin under the Fleet facility was
125 basis points. At July 3, 2004, the LIBOR margin
was 62.5 basis points, reflecting an improvement in our
fixed-charge coverage ratio.

The Fleet facility prohibits Coach from paying
dividends while the credit facility is in place, with certain
exceptions. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will
be at the discretion of Coach’s Board of Directors and will
be dependent upon Coach’s financial condition, operating
results, capital requirements and such other factors as the
Board of Directors deems relevant.

The Fleet facility contains various covenants and
customary events of default. The Company has been in compliance
with all covenants since its inception.

To provide funding for working capital and
general corporate purposes, Coach Japan entered into credit
facilities with several Japanese financial institutions. These
facilities allow a maximum borrowing of 8.6 billion yen or
approximately $79,000 at July 3, 2004. Interest is based on
the Tokyo Interbank rate plus a margin of up to 50 basis
points.

These facilities contain various covenants and
customary events of default. Coach Japan has been in compliance
with all covenants since their inception. These facilities
include automatic renewals based on compliance with the
covenants. Coach, Inc. is not a guarantor on any of these
facilities.

During fiscal 2004 and 2003, the peak borrowings
under the Japanese credit facilities were $36,084 and $43,443.
As of July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, outstanding
borrowings under the Japanese credit facilities were $1,699 and
$26,471, respectively.

Long-Term
Debt

Coach is party to an Industrial Revenue Bond
related to its Jacksonville, Florida facility. This loan has a
remaining balance of $3,535 and bears interest at 8.77%.
Principal and interest payments are made semi annually, with the
final payment due in 2014. Future principal payments under the
Industrial Revenue Bond are as follows:

5.

Leases

Coach leases certain office, distribution and
retail facilities. The lease agreements, which expire at various
dates through 2016, are subject, in some cases, to renewal
options and provide for the payment of taxes, insurance and
maintenance. Certain leases contain escalation clauses resulting
from the pass-through of increases in operating costs, property
taxes and the effect on costs from changes in consumer price
indices. Certain rentals are also contingent upon factors such
as sales. Rent-free periods and scheduled rent increases are
recorded as components of rent expense on a straight-line basis
over the related terms of such leases. Contingent rentals are
recognized when the achievement of the target (i.e. sales
levels), which triggers the related payment, is considered
probable. Rent expense for the Company’s operating leases
consisted of the following:

Future minimum rental payments under
noncancelable operating leases are as follows:

Certain operating leases provide for renewal for
periods of three to five years at their fair rental value at the
time of renewal. In the normal course of business, operating
leases are generally renewed or replaced by new leases.

6.

Commitments and Contingencies

At July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, the
Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $50,473 and
$48,336, respectively. Of these amounts, $16,764 and $19,820,
respectively, related to the letter of credit obtained in
connection with leases transferred to the Company by the Sara
Lee Corporation, for which Sara Lee retains contingent
liability. Coach expects that it will be required to maintain
the letter of credit for at least 10 years. The remaining
letters of credit, which expire at various dates through 2007,
primarily collateralize the Company’s obligation to third
parties for the purchase of inventory and lease guarantees.

Coach is a party to employment agreements with
certain executives, which provide for compensation and other
benefits. The agreements also provide for severance payments
under certain circumstances.

Coach is a party to several pending legal
proceedings and claims. Although the outcome of such items
cannot be determined with certainty, Coach’s general
counsel and management are of the opinion that the final outcome
will not have a material effect on Coach’s cash flow,
results of operations or financial position.

7.

Investments

At June 28, 2003, the Company had no
investments. During fiscal 2004, the Company began investing in
marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days,
in order to maximize the rate of return on investments. The
Company’s investments consist of U.S. government and
agency debt securities as well as municipal government and
corporate debt securities. As the Company has both the ability
and the intent to hold these securities until maturity, all
investments are classified as held to maturity and stated at
amortized cost. The Company’s investment securities are as
follows:

Securities with maturity dates within one year
are classified as short-term investments. Securities with
maturity dates greater than one year are classified as long-term
investments. At July 3, 2004, the maturity dates of
long-term investments, based on current contractual maturities,
extend to December 2005. Actual maturities could differ from
contractual maturities as some borrowers have the right to call
certain obligations.

The difference between amortized cost and fair
value is the result of unrecognized losses in fiscal 2004.

8.

Stock-Based Compensation

Coach Stock-Based
Plans.

Coach maintains the 2000
Stock Incentive Plan and the 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock
Plan to award stock options and other forms of equity
compensation to certain members of Coach management and the
outside members of its Board of Directors. These plans were
approved by Coach’s stockholders during fiscal 2002. The
exercise price of each stock option equals 100% of the market
price of Coach’s stock on the date of grant and generally
has a maximum term of 10 years. Options generally vest
ratably over three years.

For options granted under Coach’s stock
option plans prior to July 1, 2003, an active employee can
receive a replacement stock option equal to the number of shares
surrendered upon a stock-for-stock exercise. The exercise price
of the replacement option is 100% of the market value at the
date of exercise of the original option and will remain
exercisable for the remaining term of the original option.
Replacement stock options generally vest six months from the
grant date. Replacement stock options of 5,632, 3,680 and 2,168
were granted in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

stock options under the Coach option plans at July 3, 2004.

The fair value of each Coach option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model and the following weighted-average assumptions:

The weighted-average fair values of individual
options granted during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $4.90,
$2.45 and $2.41, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan.

During fiscal 2002, Coach
established the employee stock purchase plan and received
stockholder approval of this program. Under this plan, full-time
Coach employees are permitted to purchase a limited number of
Coach common shares at 85% of market value. Under this plan,
Coach sold 100, 134 and 52 shares to employees in fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Pro forma compensation
expense is calculated for the fair value of employees’
purchase rights using the Black-Scholes model and the following
weighted-average assumptions:

The weighted-average fair value of the purchase
rights granted during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $9.70,
$5.19 and $2.94, respectively.

Stock Unit
Awards.

Restricted stock unit
awards of Coach common stock have been granted to employees as
retention awards. The value of retention awards is determined
based upon the fair value of Coach stock at the grant date.
Stock awards are restricted and subject to forfeiture until the
retention period is completed. The retention period is generally
three years. As of July 3, 2004, retention awards of
796 shares were outstanding. This value is initially
recorded as unearned compensation and is charged to earnings
over the retention period. The amortization expense related to
these awards was $4,410, $1,568 and $766 for fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

Deferred
Compensation.

Under the Coach,
Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, executive officers
and certain employees at or above the senior director level may
elect to defer all or a portion of their annual bonus or annual
base salary into the plan. Under the Coach, Inc. Deferred
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, Coach’s
outside directors may similarly defer their director’s
fees. Amounts deferred under these plans may, at the
participants’ election, be either represented by deferred
stock units, which represent the right to receive shares of
Coach common stock on the distribution date elected by the
participant, or placed in an interest-bearing account to be paid
on such distribution date. The amounts accrued under these plans
at July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003 were $4,263 and
$2,915, respectively, and are included in other noncurrent
liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

9.

Retirement Plans

Coach maintains the Coach, Inc. Savings and
Profit Sharing Plan, which is a defined contribution plan.
Employees who meet certain eligibility requirements and are not
part of a collective bargaining agreement may participate in
this program. The annual expense incurred by Coach for this
defined contribution plan was $7,620, $5,308 and $3,926 in
fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Coach also sponsors a noncontributory defined
benefit plan, The Coach Leatherware Company, Inc. Supplemental
Pension Plan, for individuals who are part of collective
bargaining arrangements. The plan provides benefits based on
years of service.

The accumulated benefit obligation for the
defined benefit pension plan was $5,260 and $5,983 at
July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003, respectively.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return
on plan assets assumption, the Company considered the current
level of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily
government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium
associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio
is invested and the expectations for future returns of each
asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then
weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for
the portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 7.50%
assumption for fiscal 2004.

The Company’s pension plan weighted-average
asset allocations, by asset category, as of the measurement
dates, are as follows:

The goals of the investment program are to fully
fund the obligation to pay retirement benefits in accordance
with the Coach Leatherware Company, Inc. Supplemental Pension
Plan and to provide returns that, along with appropriate funding
from Coach, maintain an asset/liability ratio that is in
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and assures
timely payment of retirement benefits. The target allocation
range of percentages for each major category of plan assets, on
a weighted-average basis, are as follows:

The equity securities category includes common
stocks, preferred stocks, and commingled funds of approved
securities. The target allocation of securities is a maximum of
5% of equity assets in any one individual common or preferred
stock and a maximum of 15% in any one mutual fund.

The Company expects to contribute $769 to its
defined benefit pension plan during the year ending July 2,
2005.

The following benefit payments, which reflect
expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

Segment Information

The Company operates its business in two
reportable segments: direct-to-consumer and indirect. The
Company’s reportable segments represent channels of
distribution that offer similar merchandise, service and
marketing strategies. Sales of Coach products through
Company-operated retail and factory stores, the Internet and the
Coach catalog constitute the direct-to-consumer segment.
Indirect refers to sales of Coach products to other retailers
and includes sales through Coach Japan. In deciding how to
allocate resources and



COACH, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements — (Continued)

(dollars and shares in thousands, except per
share data)

assess performance, Coach’s executive
officers regularly evaluate the sales and operating income of
these segments. Operating income is the gross margin of the
segment less direct expenses of the segment. Unallocated
corporate expenses include production variances, general
marketing, administration and information systems, as well as
distribution and customer service expenses.



COACH, INC.

The following is a summary of the common costs
not allocated in the determination of segment performance.

Geographic Area Information

As of July 3, 2004, Coach operated 174
retail stores and 76 factory stores in North America and
operated distribution, product development and quality control
locations in the United States, Italy, Hong Kong, China and
South Korea. Geographic revenue information is based on the
location of our customer. Geographic long-lived asset
information is based on the physical location of the assets at
the end of each period. Indirectly, through Coach Japan, Coach
operates 100 department store shop-in-shops, and retail and
factory store locations in Japan.

11.     Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

Substantially all purchases and sales involving
international parties are denominated in U.S. dollars, the
majority of which are not hedged using any derivative
instruments. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to
Coach Japan as a result of its U.S. dollar-denominated
inventory purchases. Coach Japan enters into certain foreign
currency derivative contracts, primarily foreign exchange
forward contracts, to manage these risks. In addition, the
Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations related to the euro-denominated expenses of its
Italian sourcing office. During the third quarter of fiscal
2003, the Company began a program to enter into certain foreign
currency derivative contracts, primarily foreign exchange
forward contracts, in order to manage these fluctuations.
However, during the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company
reassessed this program and determined, based on current
business conditions, that the Company would discontinue hedging
against the euro.

The foreign currency contracts entered into by
the Company have durations no greater than 12 months. The
fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in
accrued liabilities at July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003
were $486 and $0, respectively. The fair value of open foreign
currency derivatives included in current assets at July 3,
2004 and June 28, 2003 was $0 and $405, respectively. As of
July 3, 2004, open foreign currency forward contracts
designated as hedges with a notional amount of $63,600 were fair
valued, resulting in a reduction to equity as a charge to other
comprehensive income of $460, net of taxes. As of June 28,
2003, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as
hedges with a notional amount of $39,300 were fair valued,
resulting in an increase to equity as a benefit to other
comprehensive income of $168, net of taxes. Also, for fiscal
2003, open foreign currency forward contracts not designated as
hedges with a notional amount of $33,150 were fair valued and
resulted in a pretax non cash benefit to earnings of $3,357. The
fair value adjustment is included as a component of selling,
general and administrative expenses.

12.     Goodwill

Changes in the carrying amounts of net goodwill
for the years ended July 3, 2004 and June 28, 2003 are
as follows:

13.     Business
Interruption Insurance

As a result of the September 11, 2001
attack, the World Trade Center store was completely destroyed.
Losses relating to the Company’s business interruption
coverage were filed with the insurers. Coach has held
discussions with its insurance carriers and expects to fully
recover these losses.

During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, Coach received
payments of $2,657, $1,484 and $1,413, respectively, under its
business interruption coverage. These amounts are included as a
reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses.

14.     Earnings Per
Share

The following is a reconciliation of the
weighted-average shares outstanding and calculation of basic and
diluted earnings per share:

15.     Stock
Repurchase Program

On September 17, 2001, the Coach Board of
Directors authorized the establishment of a common stock
repurchase program. Under this program, up to $80,000 may be
utilized to repurchase common stock through September 2004. On
January 30, 2003, the Coach Board of Directors approved an
additional common stock repurchase program to acquire up to
$100,000 of Coach’s outstanding common stock through
January 2006 and extended the duration of Coach’s existing
repurchase program through January 2006. Purchases of Coach
stock may be made from time to time, subject to market
conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market
purchases. Repurchased shares will become authorized but
unissued shares and may be issued in the future for general
corporate and other uses. The Company may terminate or limit the
stock repurchase program at any time.

During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company
repurchased and retired 1,511, 3,858 and 1,720 shares of common
stock at an average cost of $36.36, $12.95 and $5.73 per share,
respectively. As of July 3, 2004, Coach had approximately
$65,000 remaining in the stock repurchase program.

16.     Related-Party
Transaction

On July 26, 2001, Coach made a loan to Reed
Krakoff, its President, Executive Creative Director, in the
principal amount of $2,000. The loan bore interest at a rate of
5.12% per annum, compounded annually. The loan amount and
applicable accrued interest, less payments received, was
recorded as a component of other noncurrent assets in the
accompanying balance sheets. Included in the loan agreement was
a repayment schedule requiring full repayment on or before
July 26, 2006.



COACH, INC.

On November 7, 2002, Mr. Krakoff paid
Coach the first principal payment of $400 under the loan
agreement. On March 11, 2004, Mr. Krakoff made an
accelerated payment to retire the full outstanding principal and
interest under the loan agreement.

17.     Coach Japan,
Inc. and the Acquisition of Distributors

In order to expand its presence in the Japanese
market and to exercise greater control over its brand in that
country, Coach formed Coach Japan, Inc. and has completed a
program to acquire the existing distributors. This entity, which
manages the Coach business in Japan, is a joint venture with
Sumitomo. Coach owns 50% of Coach Japan and is deemed to have
control as Coach appoints a majority of the Board of Directors,
and, as such, Coach Japan is accounted for as a consolidated
subsidiary. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement,
Coach supplies its merchandise to Coach Japan for distribution
and sale in Japan. Additionally, the joint venture agreement
contains provisions to enable Coach to purchase the remaining
minority interest in Coach Japan after the beginning of the
seventh year of the joint venture agreement. Alternatively,
Sumitomo could require Coach to purchase its ownership interest
in the joint venture after such time as established in the terms
of the joint venture agreement.

On July 31, 2001, Coach Japan completed the
purchase of 100% of the capital stock of P.D.C. Co. Ltd.
(“PDC”) from the Mitsukoshi Department Store Group
(“Mitsukoshi”) for a total purchase price of $9,018.
Mitsukoshi established PDC in 1991 to expand Coach distribution
to select department stores throughout Japan. At the time of
acquisition PDC operated 63 retail and department store
locations in Japan. The strength of the going concern and the
established locations supported a premium above the fair value
of the individual assets. The fair value of assets acquired was
$22,351, and liabilities assumed were $20,732. Excess purchase
price over fair market value is reported as goodwill. Results of
the acquired business are included in the consolidated financial
statements from August 1, 2001, onward. Unaudited pro forma
information related to this acquisition is not included, as the
impact of this transaction was not material to the consolidated
results of the Company.

On January 1, 2002, Coach Japan completed
the buyout of the distribution rights and assets, related to the
Coach business, from J. Osawa and Company, Ltd.
(“Osawa”) for $5,792 in cash. At the time of the
acquisition, Osawa operated 13 retail and department store
locations in Japan. The strength of the going concern and the
established locations supported a premium above the fair value
of the individual assets. The assets acquired of $5,371 were
recorded at estimated fair values as determined by the
Company’s management. Goodwill of $421 has been recognized
for the excess of the purchase price over the estimate of fair
market value of the net assets acquired. Results of the acquired
business are included in the consolidated financial statements
from January 1, 2002, onward. Unaudited pro forma
information related to this acquisition is not included, as the
impact of this transaction was not material to the consolidated
results of the Company.

As of July 3, 2004, there were 102 Coach
locations in Japan, including 77 department store shop-in-shops,
three flagship locations, and 10 retail and 10 factory store
locations, managed by Coach Japan, as well as two airport
locations operated by a distributor.

18.     Reorganization
Costs

In March 2002, Coach ceased production at its
Lares, Puerto Rico, manufacturing facility. This reorganization
involved the termination of 394 manufacturing, warehousing and
management employees and the disposition of the fixed assets at
the Lares, Puerto Rico, facility. These actions reduced costs by
the resulting transfer of production to lower cost third-party
manufacturers. Coach recorded reorganization costs of $3,373 in
fiscal 2002. The reorganization costs included $2,229 for worker
separation costs, $659 for lease

termination costs and $485 for the write-down of
long-lived assets to net realizable value. The composition of
the reorganization reserve, included in accrued liabilities, is
set forth in the following table:

19.     Shareholder
Rights Plan

On May 3, 2001, Coach declared a
“poison pill” dividend distribution of rights to buy
additional common stock, to the holder of each outstanding share
of Coach’s common stock.

Subject to limited exceptions, these rights may
be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10% or
more of the Company’s common stock or announces a tender
offer for 10% or more of the common stock on terms not approved
by the Coach Board of Directors. In this event, each right would
entitle the holder of each share of Coach’s common stock to
buy one additional common share of the Company at an exercise
price far below the then-current market price. Subject to
certain exceptions, Coach’s Board of Directors will be
entitled to redeem the rights at $0.001 per right at any time
before the close of business on the tenth day following either
the public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of
Coach’s Board of Directors becomes aware that, a person has
acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. As of the
end of fiscal 2004, there were no shareholders whose common
stock holdings exceeded the 10% threshold established by the
rights plan.

20.     Subsequent
Event

On August 12, 2004, the Coach Board of
Directors approved a $200,000 increase to the Company’s
existing common stock repurchase program and extended the
duration of this program through August 2006.

During August 2004, the Company repurchased 2,430
