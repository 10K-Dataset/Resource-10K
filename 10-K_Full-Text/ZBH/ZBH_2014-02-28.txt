or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

OVERVIEW

We are a global leader in the
design, development, manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive, spinal and trauma devices, biologics, dental implants and related surgical products. We also provide other healthcare related services. In this report, “Zimmer,”
“we,” “us,” “our” and similar words refer collectively to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

Zimmer Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our history dates to 1927, when Zimmer Manufacturing Company, a predecessor, was
founded in Warsaw, Indiana. On August 6, 2001, Zimmer Holdings was spun off from its former parent and became an independent public company.

CUSTOMERS, SALES AND MARKETING

Our primary customers include orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, oral surgeons, dentists, hospitals, stocking distributors, healthcare
dealers and, in their capacity as agents, healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups. These customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists.

We have operations in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100 countries. We manage our operations through three major
geographic segments – the Americas, which is comprised principally of the U.S. and includes other North, Central and South American markets; Europe, which is comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and Africa markets; and
Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan and Australia and includes other Asian and Pacific markets.

We market and
sell products through three principal channels: 1) direct to healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, referred to as direct channel accounts; 2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers; and 3) directly to dental practices and dental
laboratories. With direct channel accounts, inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers. With sales to stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices and dental laboratories, title to product passes upon shipment or
upon implantation of the product. Direct channel accounts represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in 2013. No individual direct channel account, stocking distributor, healthcare dealer, dental practice or dental laboratory accounted
for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2013.

We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to
consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors, including demand, manufacturing lead times and quantities required to
maintain service levels. We also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices.

We utilize a network of sales associates, sales managers and support personnel, some of
whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies. We invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and
uses. Sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons.

In response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world, our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region. We utilize a global approach to sales force
training, marketing and medical education to provide consistent, high quality service. Additionally, we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, dentists and oral surgeons and the
medical procedures they perform.

The following is a summary of our three reportable segments. See Note 17 to the consolidated
financial statements for more information regarding our segments.

Americas

.    The Americas is our
largest geographic segment, accounting for $2,619.8 million, or 57 percent, of 2013 net sales, with the U.S. accounting for 92 percent of net sales in this region. The U.S. sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales
agents, most of whom sell products exclusively for Zimmer. The sales force in the U.S. receives a commission on product sales and is responsible for many operating decisions and costs.

In this region, we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume
discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group. Generally, we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products, although members are not obligated to purchase our products. Contracts with
group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years, with extensions as warranted.

In the Americas, we monitor
and rank independent sales agents and our direct sales force across a range of performance metrics, including the achievement of sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of working capital.

Europe.

The European geographic segment accounted for $1,212.6 million, or 26 percent, of 2013 net sales,
with France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom collectively accounting for 70 percent of net sales in the region. This segment also includes other key markets, including Benelux, Nordic, Central and Eastern Europe,
the Middle East and Africa. Our sales force in this segment is comprised of direct sales associates, commissioned agents, independent distributors and sales support personnel. We emphasize the advantages of our clinically proven, established
designs and innovative solutions and new and enhanced materials and surfaces. In most European countries, healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore government



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

budgets impact healthcare spending, which can affect our sales in this segment.

Asia Pacific

.    The Asia Pacific geographic segment accounted for $791.0 million, or 17 percent, of 2013 net sales, with Japan being the largest market within this
segment, accounting for 44 percent of the region’s sales. This segment also includes key markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Korea, China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia. In Japan and most countries in the Asia
Pacific region, we maintain a network of dealers, who act as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the region, and sales associates, who build and maintain relationships with orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons and dental surgeons in their markets.
These sales associates cover over 7,000 hospitals in the region. The knowledge and skills of these sales associates play a critical role in providing service, product information and support to surgeons. In 2012, we opened a research and development
center in Beijing, China, which focuses on products and technologies designed to meet the unique needs of Asian patients and their healthcare providers.

SEASONALITY

Our business is seasonal in nature to some extent, as many of our products are used in elective procedures, which typically decline during the summer months and can increase at the end of the year once
annual deductibles have been met on health insurance plans.

DISTRIBUTION

We operate distribution facilities
domestically in Warsaw, Indiana; Southaven, Mississippi; and Carlsbad, California and internationally in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

We generally ship our orders via expedited courier. We do not consider our backlog of firm orders to be material to an understanding of our business.

PRODUCTS

Our products include orthopaedic reconstructive implants, spinal and trauma devices, biologics, dental implants and related surgical
products.

Orthopaedic Reconstructive Implants

Knees

Total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral
component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an articular surface (placed on the tibial tray). Knee replacement surgeries include first-time, or primary, joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement, repair or
enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure. There are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee, which treat limited knee

degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side, or compartment, of the knee with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis. Our knee portfolio also includes early intervention and joint
preservation products, which seek to preserve the joint by repairing or regenerating damaged tissues and by treating osteoarthritis.

Hips

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the femur and the socket portion of the pelvis (acetabulum) of the natural hip. Hip procedures include first time, or primary, joint replacement as
well as revision procedures. Hip implant procedures involve the use of bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the surrounding bone, or are press-fit into bone, which means that they have a surface that bone affixes to through
either ongrowth or ingrowth technologies.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We have extensive research and
development activities to develop new surgical techniques, materials, biologics and product designs. The research and development teams work closely with our strategic brand marketing function. The rapid commercialization of innovative new
materials, biologics products, implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an important driver of sales growth.

We are broadening our offerings in each of our product categories and exploring new technologies with possible applications in multiple
areas. Our primary research and development facility is located in Warsaw, Indiana. We have other research and development personnel based in, among other places, Montreal, Canada; Beijing, China; Winterthur, Switzerland; Austin, Texas; Minneapolis,
Minnesota; Carlsbad, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Dover, Ohio; and Parsippany, New Jersey. As of December 31, 2013, we employed nearly 1,000 research and development employees worldwide.

We expect to continue to identify innovative technologies, which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses, establishing
technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE

We are subject to government
regulation in the countries in which we conduct business. In the U.S., numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market. These include, among others, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and
regulations issued or promulgated thereunder. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development, manufacture, advertising, promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products, including
medical devices. In addition, the FDA controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public.

Most of our new products fall into an FDA classification that requires the submission of a Premarket Notification (510(k)) to the
FDA. This process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is, substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device. We must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency
claims. Before we can market the new device, we must receive an order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the U.S.

Other devices we develop and market are in a category (class) for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and
Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. The PMA process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it
determines that the data and information in the PMA application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

All of our devices marketed in the U.S. have been cleared or approved by the FDA, with the
exception of some devices which were in commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976. The FDA has grandfathered these devices, so new FDA submissions are not required.

Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and
manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System
regulations among other FDA requirements, such as restrictions on advertising and promotion. The Quality System regulations govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging and servicing of all
finished medical devices intended for human use. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could
require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund payment of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or
misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices.

The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or
restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), administers controls over the import of medical devices
into the U.S. The CBP imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. We are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain U.S. government
agencies, including the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Commerce Department and the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Treasury Department.

There are also requirements of state, local and foreign governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among other things,
design and product standards, packaging requirements and labeling requirements. Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The member countries of the European Union have
adopted the European Medical Device Directive, which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries. Compliance with the Medical Device Directive and certification to a quality system enable the
manufacturer to place a CE mark on its products. To obtain authorization to affix the CE mark to a product, a recognized European

Notified Body must assess a manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the Medical Device Directive. We are subject to inspection by the Notified
Bodies for compliance with these requirements.

Further, we are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws concerning
healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims and anti-kickback laws, as well as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state and healthcare professional payment transparency laws. These laws are administered by, among others, the U.S.
Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect
to medical device manufacturers in recent years. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government
healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration (VA) health programs.

Our operations in foreign
countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our global operations are also subject to foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act, among others. As part of our global compliance
program, we seek to address anti-corruption risks proactively.

Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex
federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges of substances in the air, water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of wastes and the clean-up of
properties by pollutants. We do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital expenditures or competitive position.

COMPETITION

The orthopaedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive. In the global markets for reconstructive implants,
trauma and related surgical products, our major competitors include: the DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Stryker Corporation, Biomet, Inc., and Smith & Nephew plc.

In the Americas geographic segment, we and the DePuy Synthes Companies, Stryker Corporation, Biomet, Inc., and Smith & Nephew,
Inc. (a subsidiary of Smith & Nephew plc) account for a large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales. There are also many smaller competitors actively engaging in this market. Some of these smaller competitors have
success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry.

The European reconstructive implant and trauma product markets are
more fragmented than those markets in the Americas or the Asia Pacific segments. The variety of philosophies held by European surgeons regarding hip reconstruction, for example, has fostered the existence of many regional European companies,
including Aesculap AG



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

(a subsidiary of B. Braun), Waldemar LINK GmbH & Co., KG and Mathys AG, which, in addition to the global competitors, compete with us. Many hip implants sold in Europe are products
developed specifically for the European market. We intend to continue to develop and produce specially tailored products to meet specific European needs.

In the Asia Pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma products, we compete primarily with the DePuy Synthes Companies, Stryker Corporation, Smith & Nephew plc and Biomet, Inc., as well
as regional companies, including Japan Medical Materials Corporation and Japan Medical Dynamic Marketing, Inc. Factors, such as the dealer system and complex regulatory environments, make it difficult for smaller companies, particularly those that
are non-regional, to compete effectively with the market leaders in the more developed healthcare markets in the Asia Pacific region.

In the spinal implant category, we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of Medtronic, Inc., the DePuy Synthes Companies, Stryker Corporation, Biomet Spine (a subsidiary of
Biomet, Inc.), NuVasive, Inc. and Globus Medical, Inc.

In the dental implant category, we compete primarily with Nobel Biocare
Holding AG, Straumann Holding AG, Dentsply International and Biomet 3i (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.).

Competition within the
industry is primarily based on technology, innovation, quality, price, reputation and customer service. A key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing products and technologies.

MANUFACTURING AND RAW MATERIALS

We manufacture our products at
various sites. Our significant manufacturing locations include Warsaw, Indiana; Winterthur, Switzerland; Ponce, Puerto Rico; Dover, Ohio; Carlsbad, California; Parsippany, New Jersey; Shannon, Ireland; and Beijing, China. We also strategically
outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components.

We believe that our
manufacturing facilities are among the best in our industry in terms of automation and productivity and have the flexibility to accommodate future growth. The manufacturing operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular
concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality, lead time reduction and capacity optimization. Our continuous improvement efforts are driven by Lean and
Six Sigma methodologies. In addition, at certain of our manufacturing facilities, many of the employees are cross-trained to perform a broad array of operations.

We generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity. We continually evaluate the potential to

in-source

and
out-source production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders.

We have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our profitability and offset the
impact of inflationary costs. We have, for example, employed computer-assisted robots and multi-axis grinders to precision polish medical devices; automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes, including on-machine inspection and
process controls; purchased state-of-the-art equipment; in-sourced core products and processes; and negotiated cost reductions from third-party suppliers.

We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external
suppliers. In addition, we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. We work closely with our suppliers
to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how,
continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information
agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information. We own or control through licensing arrangements more than 4,500 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to
aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2013, we
employed approximately 9,500 employees worldwide, including nearly 1,000 employees dedicated to research and development. Approximately 5,200 employees are located within the U.S. and approximately 4,300 employees are located outside
of the U.S., primarily throughout Europe and in Japan. We have approximately 3,900 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide. The Warsaw, Indiana production facility employs approximately 1,600 employees.

Approximately 180 U.S. employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have a collective
bargaining agreement with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC for and on behalf of Local 2737-15 covering employees at the Dover, Ohio facility,
which continues in effect until May 15, 2015.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could
negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business
may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

Our success depends on our ability to
effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.

We operate in a highly competitive
environment. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies. To remain competitive, we
must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies. Competition is primarily on the basis of:

•

technology;

•

innovation;

•

quality;

•

reputation; and

•

customer service.

In markets outside of the U.S., other factors influence competition as well, including:

•

local distribution systems;

•

complex regulatory environments; and

•

differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

Our competitors may:

•

have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

•

respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

•

undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

•

adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

•

be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.

Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty
maintaining or increasing sales of our products.

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may
become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Demand for
our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of:

•

evolving customer needs;

•

changing demographics;

•

slowing industry growth rates;

•

declines in the reconstructive implant market;

•

the introduction of new products and technologies;

•

evolving surgical philosophies; and

•

evolving industry standards.

Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new
product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:

•

properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

•

commercialize new products in a timely manner;

•

manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time;

•

differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings;

•

achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

•

satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost
procedures;

•

innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and

•

provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors:

•

entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

•

the need for regulatory clearance; and

•

uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to
fund the production. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they
may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.

If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be
harmed.

We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which
receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors may deny reimbursement if
they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for
experimental procedures and devices.

In addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs
by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. If third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we
may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

We have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets. If key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the
reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.

The U.S. healthcare
reform legislation includes provisions that may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

The
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act), was signed into law in March 2010 and mandates health insurance
coverage and other healthcare reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. As part of the Affordable Care Act, in January 2013 we began paying a 2.3 percent medical device excise tax on the vast majority of our U.S sales. We continue to
identify ways to reduce spending in other areas to offset the earnings impact due to the tax. We are not able to pass along the cost of the tax to hospitals, which continue to face cuts to their Medicare reimbursement under the Affordable Care Act
and other legislation. Nor are we able to offset the cost of the tax through higher sales volumes resulting from the expansion of health insurance coverage because of the demographics of the current uninsured population. The medical device excise
tax regulations and subsequent guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury have not lessened the burden of complying with the excise tax statute. In addition, without the implementation of proper safeguards, the Affordable Care Act’s
Medicare payment reforms, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments, could provide additional incentives for healthcare providers to reduce spending on some of our medical device products and reduce utilization of hospital
procedures that use our products. Accordingly, while it is still too early to fully understand and predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act on our business, ongoing implementation could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and cash flows.

The ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Many customers for our products have formed group purchasing
organizations in an effort to contain costs. Group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s
affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has
negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to respond to the
cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

We are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products,
non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The medical
devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be
costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in
substantial additional costs.

Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under
FDA regulations. Compliance with the FDA’s requirements, including the Quality System regulation, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is
monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA, which may result in observations on Form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not
in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a
recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such devices, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and
others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical
devices and assess civil or criminal



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict
us from effectively marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations,
our business could be harmed.

If we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, we could face
substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our industry is
subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the federal False Claims Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal Stark law, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine
Act and similar state and foreign laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare
programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration (VA) health programs. The interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change.

The “conflict minerals” rule may adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture
of our products, may increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and harm our reputation.

We are subject to the
SEC’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries.
U.S. public companies that manufacture products that contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of their products must annually disclose whether the minerals in their products originated from one of these
countries and the procedures employed to determine the sourcing of such minerals. These requirements became effective for the 2013 calendar year, with initial disclosure reports due in May 2014. We are incurring costs to comply with this rule,
including for diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain the necessary information on conflict minerals from our suppliers or that we will be able to determine
that all of our products are conflict-free. As a result, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of
all conflict minerals used in our products. This rule also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase
our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.

We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the U.S., which
subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.

We sell our
products in more than 100 countries and derived almost 50 percent of our net sales in 2013 from outside the U.S. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to
additional risks associated with international sales and operations. Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:

•

changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

•

unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;

•

differing local product preferences and product requirements;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;

•

trade protection measures and import or export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our
operating costs;

•

foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;

•

complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

•

extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;

•

effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

labor force instability;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

•

political and economic instability.

Violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.

We may have additional tax liabilities.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business,
there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any
related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that
determination is made.

We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of
funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.

Challenging global economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations.

Since 2008, the global economy has been impacted by an ongoing series of financial crises. Although the U.S. economy is recovering,
unemployment remains high and consumer confidence remains low, resulting in reduced numbers of insured patients and the deferral of elective reconstructive procedures. Global economic conditions, particularly in Europe, our second-largest operating
segment, remain uncertain. We believe that European austerity measures implemented to address the ongoing financial crisis contributed to decreased healthcare utilization and increased pricing pressure for some of our products. We cannot assure you
that challenges in the global economy will not continue to negatively impact procedure volumes, average selling prices and reimbursement rates from third-party payors, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we
have experienced delays in the collection of receivables from hospitals in certain countries that have national healthcare systems, including certain regions in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, which are the countries most directly affected by the
Euro zone crisis. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries. Further, there are concerns for the overall stability and suitability of the Euro as a single currency. Continuing high
unemployment in the U.S., a worsening of the European financial situation or a failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of our European receivables could adversely affect our results of operations.

We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to
decline and expose us to counterparty risks.

A substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in Europe and
Japan. The U.S. dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese Yen, as well as other currencies, could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations. Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may
not prove to be fully effective.

Pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our
financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.

Our business exposes us to potential product
liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects
or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. As previously reported, we temporarily suspended

the marketing and distribution of our

Durom

®

Acetabular Component (

Durom

Cup) in the U.S. in July 2008. Subsequently, a number of product liability lawsuits and other claims have been asserted against us. We have settled some of these claims and the others are still pending. Additional
claims may be asserted in the future. We are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to
defend. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.

Although we maintain third-party product liability insurance coverage, we have substantial self-insured retention amounts that
we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement. Furthermore, even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our
insurance policies and we would have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits. Product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to
protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products,
or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.

Claims of intellectual property
infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly. At any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of
patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of
significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business and results of operations.

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We rely on a
combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so. While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents,
trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Further, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in
the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the
required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.

In addition, intellectual property rights may be
unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries. If we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property, our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired, which could limit our growth and
revenue.

We also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation with
security measures, including the use of non-disclosure and other agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that
others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.

We are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.

In addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial litigation and
claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and
management’s view of these matters may change in the future. Given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. We could
in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.

If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Our marketing success in the U.S. and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and
service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments. A loss of a significant number of
these agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We depend on a limited number
of suppliers for some key raw materials and outsourced activities.

We use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we
need to manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing activities. These suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our quality and regulatory requirements. Some key raw
materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources. A prolonged disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or

outsource key manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products.

Future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating
results.

Our assets include intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisition activity and
represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be
recoverable. If the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our
businesses decline, we could be required, under current U.S. accounting rules, to record a non-cash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment. Any write-off of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would
negatively affect our results of operations.

We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if
we fail to effectively maintain or protect the integrity of our information systems and data, our business could be adversely affected.

We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure. As a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system
platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing
commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and the increasing need to
protect patient and customer information. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information. If we fail to maintain or protect
our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing,
detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a
data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading
and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that systems issues will not arise in
the future.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive.

We intend to continue to look for additional strategic acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our
businesses and other companies with whom we could form strategic alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit intellectual property rights. These activities involve risks, including the following:

•

we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other more profitable
activities;

•

the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses may be increased if we need to integrate geographically separated organizations, personnel with
disparate business backgrounds and companies with different corporate cultures;

•

we may not recognize expected cost savings or the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or strategic alliances;

•

our acquisition candidates or strategic partners may have unexpected liabilities or prove unable to meet their obligations to us or the joint venture;
and

•

the priorities of our strategic partners may prove incompatible with ours.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the
rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2012 and 2011 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation.

EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW

2013 Results

Our 2013 sales results reflected increased growth as compared
with 2012 trends. Sales from new product introductions, such as

Persona

The Personalized Knee System and the

Transposal

Fluid Waste Management System, as well as a stable or slightly improved joint replacement market, drove sales
volume and product mix growth. This was partially offset by continued pricing pressure, as well as negative effects from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our gross profit declined slightly in 2013 compared to 2012. We realized lower gross margins caused by excess and obsolete inventory charges for products we intend to discontinue, as well as a higher mix
of lower margin product and geographic revenues.

Operating expenses increased by $2.6 million in 2013, while operating
expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in 2013 relative to 2012. We incurred higher selling expenses, “Certain claims” and “Special items” in 2013 relative to 2012, but we did not incur a goodwill impairment charge in 2013,
whereas in 2012 we recorded a $96.0 million goodwill impairment charge. The selling expense increase was due to sales growth. “Certain claims” expense is a provision for estimated liabilities to

Durom

Cup patients undergoing
revision surgeries. “Special items” are primarily related to our quality and operational excellence initiatives, which are intended to improve our future operating results and include centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and
improving quality, distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and information technology systems.

Our effective tax rate (ETR)
benefited from changes in the mix of income between taxing jurisdictions. The significant expenses for our excess and obsolete inventory charges, “Certain claims” and “Special items” were primarily incurred in jurisdictions with
higher rates of tax, which lowered taxable income in those jurisdictions.

Sales increased 3 percent in 2013 relative to
2012, while net earnings increased 1 percent. Net earnings grew at a slower pace than sales primarily due to lower gross profit.

2014 Outlook

We estimate our net sales will grow between 2.5 and 4.5 percent in 2014. This assumes the market for knee and hip
procedures will remain stable and grow in the low to
mid-

single digits. We expect pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth of between 2 and 3 percent, and foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative effect on sales growth of between 0
and 1 percent based upon December 31, 2013 rates.

Assuming currency rates remain at December 31, 2013 levels, we
expect our gross margin to be between 73 and 74 percent of sales in 2014. This range assumes that foreign currency hedge gains will be higher in 2014 than in 2013. The range also takes into consideration the full year impact of the 2.3 percent
medical device excise tax on a majority of our U.S. sales. Pursuant to the tax regulations, the excise tax is imposed on the first sale in the U.S. by the manufacturer, producer or importer of a medical device to either a third party or an
affiliated distribution entity. We distribute a majority of our musculoskeletal products through an affiliated distribution entity. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), excise taxes incurred to transfer inventory to its
current location can be included in the cost of the inventory. Accordingly, a majority of the excise tax will be capitalized in inventory and the expense will be deferred until that inventory is sold on a first-in first-out basis. Based upon the
levels of inventory we were carrying before the medical device excise tax was effective, we did not recognize any of the excise tax until the fourth quarter of 2013. The excise tax is derived from a constructive sales price, as defined by U.S. tax
law and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance. Prior to the medical device excise tax effective date, the IRS issued interim rules (see IRS Notice 2012-77) that provide, among other things, that medical device manufacturers selling to an
affiliated distribution entity may apply a 28.75% discount off retail selling prices when computing the tax base. We are in discussions with the IRS as to what an appropriate constructive sales price should be under IRS excise tax regulations and
our specific business model. As a result of our discussions with the IRS, our ultimate medical device excise tax may differ from the amount determined under Notice 2012-77. We estimate the cost in 2014 will be approximately $10 million per quarter.
Since we recognize the medical device excise tax as a part of the cost of inventory, the amount expensed in any particular quarter will vary according to U.S. sales levels in that quarter.

We expect to continue making investments in research and development (R&D) of between 4 and 4.5 percent of sales in 2014. Selling,
general and administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percentage of sales is expected to be between 38.5 and 39 percent in 2014 as we realize efficiencies from our quality and operational excellence initiatives and further leverage revenue growth.

We expect to incur approximately $250 million of expenses in 2014 related to our quality and operational excellence
initiatives and integration costs from recent acquisitions. The quality and operational excellence programs are intended to improve our future operating results and include centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality,
distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and information technology systems. We expect to recognize the

majority of these expenses in “Special items” on our statement of earnings, but some will be related to inventory and be reflected in costs of products sold.

Assuming variable interest rates remain at December 31, 2013 levels, we expect interest income and expense, net, to be similar to
2013.

We expect our ETR to increase in 2014 relative to 2013, as we do not anticipate certain significant costs, such as
excess and obsolete inventory charges and “Certain claims”

that were incurred in jurisdictions with higher tax rates, to recur, thus increasing the profit in those higher tax jurisdictions.

Based upon the above, we expect reported net earnings and diluted earnings per share to increase in a range of approximately 13 to 17
percent in 2014 relative to 2013, stemming from anticipated higher sales and an improved gross margin.

Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends

Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 7 percentage points of year-over-year sales growth in 2013, which is a higher growth rate than experienced in 2012 compared to 2011. In
2013, accelerated growth was fueled by the introduction of new products, such as

Persona

The Personalized Knee System and the

Transposal

Fluid Waste Management System.

We believe procedure volumes in the broader musculoskeletal market remained stable or improved slightly in 2013 relative to 2012. We
believe long-term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles,
among other factors. In addition, demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices will continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value in these advanced technologies.

Pricing Trends

Global
selling prices had a negative effect of 2 percent on year-over-year sales during 2013. Our Americas and Europe reporting segments and certain countries in our Asia Pacific reporting segment continued to experience pricing pressure from governmental
healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems. For 2014, we estimate that selling prices will decline slightly more than they did in 2013 due to a biennial price adjustment in Japan in the second quarter of 2014
along with some moderately weaker pricing in Europe. Overall, we estimate prices will have a negative effect of 2 to 3 percent on year-over-year sales in 2014.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

For 2013, foreign currency exchange rates
resulted in a 2 percent decrease in sales, primarily from the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen in the period. If foreign currency exchange rates remain consistent with December 31, 2013 rates, we estimate that a
stronger dollar versus foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative effect on sales in 2014 of 0 to 1 percent. We address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and foreign
currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which are recorded in cost of products sold,
the effect on net earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal.

Knees

Knee sales increased 4 percent in 2013 compared to flat sales in 2012. Our Knee product category has benefited from new product
introductions, such as

Persona

The Personalized Knee System and early intervention products, as well as increased procedure volumes in the market. We are cautiously optimistic that volume/mix trends will continue to remain stable in 2014.

In 2013, we continued a broader launch of

Persona

The Personalized Knee System. We
intend to continue to deploy implant and instrument sets to all geographic regions during 2014 and beyond. In the meantime, our

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution product line is still our leading knee system in terms of sales. Products
driving growth in this category in 2013 in addition to

Persona

The Personalized Knee System included

Zimmer

Patient Specific Instruments, the

Zimmer

Unicompartmental High Flex Knee and our early intervention products.

In Europe, changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected knee sales in 2013 and 2012 by positive 2 percent and negative
6 percent, respectively. In Asia Pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative 9 percent effect on knee sales in 2013 and a minimal effect in 2012.

Hips

Hip sales declined by 1 percent in each of the last two years. We
believe that industry procedure volumes were stable or improved slightly in 2013, while pricing was negative. As compared to our Knee product category, our overall Hip product category is more exposed to certain negative factors in Europe and Asia
Pacific, as we derive a higher percentage of total hip sales in those regions when compared to our Knee business. More specifically, Europe continues to be a difficult market with government budget constraints. In Asia Pacific, the strengthening of
the U.S. Dollar versus the Japanese Yen caused a significant decline in Asia Pacific hip sales in 2013.

In Europe,
changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in 2013 and 2012 by positive 2 percent and negative 6 percent, respectively. In Asia Pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected hip sales in 2013 and 2012 by negative 11
percent and positive 1 percent, respectively.

Leading hip stem sales were the

Dental

Dental sales increased 1 percent in 2013 after a 4 percent decline in 2012. While the Americas dental sales increased in 2012, the overall performance of our dental franchise was impacted by several
factors, including softening in certain international markets and lower inventory levels maintained by our stocking distributors. In 2013, the effects of those negative factors in 2012 were less pronounced which resulted in slightly improved sales
of dental reconstructive implants and digital solutions, offset by decreases in restorative products and regenerative products. We believe the dental market continues to be challenged both in the U.S. and internationally. Dental sales in 2013 were
led by the

Tapered Screw-Vent

Implant System.

Trauma

Trauma sales increased by 2 percent and 8 percent in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. In this product
category, changes in foreign exchange rates had a greater negative impact on 2013 sales than in our other product categories due to the geographic mix of our Trauma sales revenue. The

Zimmer Natural Nail

System continued to increase sales
significantly. However, this increase was partially at the expense of our other intramedullary nail systems. In addition to the

Zimmer Natural Nail

System, the

Zimmer

Periarticular Locking Plates System led trauma sales.

Spine

We experienced mid-single digit sales declines in Spine each of the past two years. This product category continues to face challenges
related to pricing pressure and payor approval. In 2013, solid sales of the

PathFinder NXT

Minimally Invasive Pedicle Screw System and

Trabecular Metal

Technology products partly offset a decline in sales of the

Dynesys

Stabilization System, the

Trinica

Select Anterior Cervical Plate System and other spine products.

Surgical and other jumped to an 18 percent sales increase in 2013 after a 9 percent increase in

Expenses as a Percent of Net Sales

Cost of Products Sold

The following table sets forth the factors that contributed to the gross margin changes in each of 2013 and 2012 compared to the prior year:

The decrease in gross margin in 2013 was primarily due to higher average costs per unit sold as a result
of changes in product and geographic mix and increased excess and obsolescence charges related to products we intend to discontinue. Additionally, lower average selling prices and certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to
quality enhancement and remediation efforts reduced gross margin. These negative effects were partially



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

offset by hedge gains recorded in 2013 from our foreign currency hedging program versus hedge losses recorded in 2012. The gains were primarily the result of the U.S. Dollar strengthening
against the Japanese Yen. Under the program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products
sold when the hedged item affects earnings.

Gross margin was the same in 2012 compared to 2011. Our foreign currency hedging
program also had a favorable impact on gross margin in 2012. Additionally, lower inventory step-up charges from acquisitions were recognized in 2012 when compared to 2011 based on the timing of acquisitions. This favorability was offset by the
effect of lower prices on gross margin.

Operating Expenses

R&D expenses and R&D as a percentage of sales have declined in the last three years. The lower spending reflected a natural
decline from certain large projects that achieved full commercialization, including

Persona

The Personalized Knee System, and a dedication of resources to our quality and operational excellence initiatives. We expect R&D spending in 2014
to be between 4 and 4.5 percent of sales.

SG&A expenses increased, but SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased in 2013
compared to 2012. The dollar increase was primarily due to higher selling and distribution expenses from higher sales and increased intangible asset amortization from acquisitions. This was partially offset by lower bad debt expenses as well as
lower legal expenses due to the conclusion of certain matters for which we are no longer incurring legal expenses, as well as normal variations in the phases of litigation, including product liability litigation. As a percentage of sales, SG&A
decreased 70 basis points in 2013 as our quality and operational excellence initiatives have produced lower variable and fixed costs in SG&A as well as the natural leverage that occurs when sales increase against our fixed costs, such as fixed
intangible asset amortization from past acquisitions.

In 2012, SG&A decreased in dollar terms and as a percent of sales.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to 2011 rates lowered SG&A expense, especially in Europe. Absent the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, selling and distribution
expenses were higher due to higher sales. Other unfavorable items included increased intangible asset amortization from business combinations, higher employee recruiting and relocation costs, increased legal costs and higher bad debt expense. These
were offset by favorable product liability claims, lower instrument excess and obsolescence charges and lower advertising spend. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 80 basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 for similar reasons noted in 2013.

“Certain claims” expense is for estimated liabilities to

Durom

Cup patients undergoing revision surgeries. We
recorded expense of $15.0 million, $157.8 million, $75.0 million, $35.0 million and $69.0 million during 2012, 2011,

2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We recorded additional expense of $47.0 million in 2013, bringing the total recorded expense to $398.8 million for these claims, excluding a subset of

Durom

Cup claims that were recorded in SG&A. The additional expense recorded in 2013 was driven primarily by more estimated claims than were previously expected. The additional expense in 2012 was primarily for more estimated claims
outside the U.S. than were previously expected, as well as higher estimated legal costs. For more information regarding these claims, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.

In connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2012, we noted that the carrying values of the
net assets of our U.S. Spine reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $96.0 million in 2012. We did not record a goodwill impairment charge in 2013, as
our annual goodwill impairment test revealed that the carrying values of the net assets of our U.S. Spine reporting unit were less than their estimated fair value. For more information regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the
2012 impairment, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

“Special items” have increased significantly
in the past three years. We continue to implement our quality and operational excellence initiatives, which are intended to improve our future operating results by centralizing or outsourcing certain functions and improving quality, distribution,
sourcing, manufacturing and our information technology systems. “Special items” expenses include consulting and professional fees, dedicated personnel costs, severance benefits as well as other costs for those programs. In addition to
expenses for our quality and operational excellence programs, we recognize expenses related to integration of acquired businesses, impairment of assets, certain R&D agreements, certain litigation settlements, contract termination expenses and
other items as “Special items.” See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding “Special items” charges.

Interest Income, Interest Expense, Income Taxes and Net Earnings

Interest
income and expense, net, were similar in 2013 and 2012 after an increase from 2011. Interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the $550 million offering of senior notes we completed in November 2012.

Our ETR on earnings before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was 22.6 percent, 24.0 percent and 22.4
percent, respectively. The variation of our ETR has largely been affected by “Special items”, “Certain claims”, goodwill impairment charges and a $34.3 million benefit in 2012 from the recognition of deferred tax assets related
to a legal entity restructuring. Higher “Special items” and “Certain claims” expense favorably affect our ETR because these expenses have mostly been incurred within jurisdictions with higher tax rates, resulting in lower taxable
income in



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

these higher tax jurisdictions. Goodwill impairment negatively affects our ETR because no tax benefit is recorded on the charge. In 2013, in addition to the effect of “Special items”
and “Certain claims,” our ETR benefited from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and other tax benefits applicable to us that applied to the 2012 and 2013 periods. Due to the timing of the extension and the applicable
GAAP rules, we recognized the 2012 benefit in the 2013 period. Additionally, in 2011 our ETR was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain tax contingencies. The items discussed accounted for the majority of the variation in our ETRs in the
past three years.

As a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously, net earnings in 2013 increased 1 percent
compared to 2012. In 2012, net earnings decreased 1 percent compared to 2011. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively, in 2013 compared to 2012, while 2012 basic and diluted earnings per share increased 7
percent and 6 percent, respectively, compared to 2011. The disproportionate changes in earnings per share as compared to net earnings are attributed to the effect of share repurchases.

For our reporting segments, operating profit increased each year in the Americas and Asia Pacific while in Europe it has decreased over
those same time periods. The increase in the Americas is indicative of increasing sales in the geographic region. In Europe and Asia Pacific, operating profit is impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. In Europe, the decline in operating profit
from 2011 to 2012 was primarily related to a 3 percent decline in sales (a 6 percent decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates offset by a 3 percent increase from the combination of volume/mix and price). In 2013, while sales did
increase by 3 percent (a 2 percent increase from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 1 percent increase from the combination of volume/mix and price) the higher sales were largely offset by hedge losses recorded in the 2013 period versus
hedge gains recorded in the 2012 period. Additionally, operating profit in Europe declined due to continuing price pressure in those markets as well as a change in the mix of sales to higher growth markets with lower operating profit margins. In
Asia Pacific, the increase in operating profit from 2011 to 2012 was driven by higher sales. The increase in operating profit in Asia Pacific from 2012 to 2013 was driven by the 8 percent increase in sales from volume/mix. While changes in foreign
currency exchange rates decreased sales by 10 percent in 2013 compared to 2012, this decline was largely offset by hedge gains recorded in 2013 versus hedge losses recorded in 2012.

Non-GAAP operating performance measures

We use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP to evaluate our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of inventory
step-up, certain inventory and manufacturing related charges connected to quality enhancement and remediation efforts, inventory obsolescence charges associated with products we intend to discontinue, “Certain claims,” “Special
items,” and any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items

in addition to certain other tax adjustments. We use this information internally and believe it is helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of our
ongoing operating results, it helps to perform trend analysis and to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items, and it provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items. Certain of
these non-GAAP financial measures are used as metrics for our incentive compensation programs.

Our non-GAAP adjusted net
earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $988.4 million, $932.5 million, and $905.6 million, respectively, and our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share were $5.75, $5.30,
and $4.80, respectively.

The following are reconciliations from our GAAP net earnings and diluted earnings per share to our
non-GAAP adjusted net earnings and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share used for internal management purposes (in millions, except per share amounts).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows provided
by operating activities were $963.1 million in 2013, compared to $1,151.9 million in 2012. The principal source of cash from operating activities in 2013 was net earnings. Non-cash charges included in net earnings accounted for another $288.8
million of operating cash. All other items of operating cash flows in 2013 were outflows of $84.9 million of cash. The lower cash flows provided by operating activities in the 2013 period were primarily due to increases in inventory caused by the
medical device excise tax and inventory investments to support new product launches. Additionally, cash flows were unfavorable compared to the



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

prior year due to spending on our quality and operational excellence initiatives. These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower product liability payments for

Durom

Cup claims,
and lower funding required on our U.S. pension plans for 2013.

At December 31, 2013, we had 65 days of sales outstanding
in trade accounts receivable, which was higher by one day compared to December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, we had 285 days of inventory on hand, a decrease of 16 days compared to December 31, 2012. We consider the changes in days
of sales outstanding and days of inventory on hand as normal fluctuations for our business.

Cash flows used in investing
activities were $282.5 million in 2013, compared to $592.1 million in 2012. Additions to instruments increased in 2013 due to purchases for significant product launches, such as

Persona

The Personalized Knee System. Spending on other
property, plant and equipment was relatively consistent in 2013 relative to 2012, reflecting cash outlays necessary to complete new product-related investments and replace older machinery and equipment. In 2014, instrument additions are expected to
be in a range of $200 to $210 million as part of our ongoing launch of

Persona

The Personalized Knee System. Property, plant and equipment additions are expected to be approximately $150 million in 2014, reflecting the cash outlays necessary
to update and modernize our manufacturing capabilities and support new product developments and commercialization activities. We invest some of our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated debt securities. The purchases and any sales or maturities
of these investments are reflected as cash flows from investing activities. The timing of these investments can vary from year to year depending on the maturity of the debt securities and other cash and cash equivalent needs. In the past three
years, we have made a number of business acquisitions including Knee Creations, LLC, NORMED Medizin-Technik GmbH, Dornoch Medical Systems, Inc., Synvasive Technology, Inc., ExtraOrtho, Inc., and certain foreign-based distributors.

Cash flows used in financing activities were $467.3 million in 2013, compared to $436.5 million in 2012. In 2013, we returned cash to our
stockholders in the form of cash dividends of $132.4 million and share repurchases of $719.0 million. Additionally, an increase in our stock price in 2013 resulted in many employees exercising stock options, which provided us with additional
cash. In 2012, we converted some of the outstanding debt under our senior credit facility to a term loan and we borrowed $100.0 million to repurchase shares as well as fund other corporate cash needs. In 2013, we paid off the amount we had borrowed
under our senior credit facility.

In 2013, we declared cash dividends in each quarter of $0.20 per share. We expect to
continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the Board of Directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. The 2013 dividend declarations equate to an annual
rate of $0.80 per share, which represents an 11 percent increase over the 2012 annualized rate.

As discussed more completely in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, the IRS
has issued proposed adjustments for years 2006 through 2009 reallocating profits between certain of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. We have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the IRS. Although the ultimate
timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, we anticipate that within the next twelve months we may settle certain tax matters with the IRS, and pay amounts for other unresolved tax matters in order to limit the potential impact
of IRS interest charges. Such payments may be significant to our 2014 operating cash flows.

As discussed in Note 19 to the
consolidated financial statements, we are defending a patent infringement lawsuit in which the trial court awarded the plaintiff $210.0 million in damages plus interest and attorneys’ fees. We have filed a Notice of Appeal and have not recorded
a liability because we do not believe it is probable that we have incurred a loss. Although we believe we have strong grounds to reverse the trial court’s judgment, we could be required to pay $210.0 million plus interest and
attorneys’ fees in the future.

Also as discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, we have recorded a
short-term liability of $50.0 million and long-term liability of $329.0 million related to

Durom

Cup product liability claims. We expect to continue paying these claims over the next five years. We have also recorded a long-term
receivable of $218.0 million that we expect to receive from insurance carriers once we reach our self-insured retention under our insurance programs.

We have four tranches of senior notes outstanding: $250 million aggregate principal amount of 1.4 percent notes due November 30, 2014, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent
notes due November 30, 2019, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 percent notes due November 30, 2021 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent notes due November 30, 2039. Interest on each series is
payable on May 30 and November 30 of each year until maturity.

We may redeem the senior notes at our election in
whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1) 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed; or 2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and
interest (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 15 basis points in the
case of the 2014 notes, 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 and 2021 notes, and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes. We would also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date.

Before our senior notes due November 30, 2014 become payable, we intend to issue new senior notes in order to pay the $250 million
owed. If we are not able to issue new senior notes, we intend to borrow against our senior credit facility to pay these notes.

We have a five year $1,350 million revolving, multi-currency, senior unsecured credit

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus an
applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating and the amounts drawn under the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a fixed-rate determined through a competitive bid process. The Senior
Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales or transfers of assets. Financial
covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. If we fall below an investment grade credit rating, additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were in
compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2013. Commitments under the Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a facility fee and a utilization fee.

We have a term loan agreement (Term Loan) with one of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility for 11.7 billion Japanese Yen that will
mature on May 31, 2016. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a fixed rate of 0.61 percent per annum until maturity.

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $50.7 million.

We
place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.

As of December 31, 2013, we had short-term and long-term investments in debt securities with a fair value of $807.7 million. These
investments are in debt securities of many different issuers and therefore we believe we have no significant concentration of risk with a single issuer. All of these debt securities remain highly-rated and we believe the risk of default by the
issuers is low.

As of December 31, 2013, $891.9 million of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term
investments were held in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. Repatriation of these assets to the U.S. may have tax consequences. $478.8 million of this amount is
denominated in U.S. Dollars and therefore bears no foreign currency translation risk. The balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.

We may use excess cash to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program. Effective January 1, 2014, we have a new share
repurchase program that authorizes purchases of up to $1.0 billion with no expiration date. No further purchases will be made under the previous share repurchase program.

Management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility or from the public and private debt markets are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs, as well as return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Should
investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

We have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments. The following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions):

$21.4 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 are
liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans. Defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions. Due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset
performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2014. Therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future
contributions to our plans. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.

Also included in other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon. Due to the uncertainties inherent
in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made. Therefore, this table does not include
any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits. Additionally, other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet include long-term deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in business combinations and fixed
assets. We have excluded these liabilities from this table as well, as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

We have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon
various events such as the achievement of certain product R&D milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product. Since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have
to be made, we have not included them in this table. These payments could range from $0 to $45 million.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our financial
results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. Significant accounting policies which require management’s judgment are discussed below.

Excess Inventory and Instruments

– We must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may
ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Accordingly, inventory and instruments
are written down to their net realizable value. To determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and
components. The basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for

work-in-process

inventory, which is
recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. Management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions, competitive offerings and
other factors on a regular basis.

Income Taxes

– Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and
reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in
determining the consolidated income tax expense.

We estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by
taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide
valuation allowances unless we determine it is “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit will be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to
the U.S.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and
regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. We record
our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all

relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax
authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.

We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the
Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these
uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which
they are determined.

Commitments and Contingencies

– Accruals for product liability and other claims are
established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. We use an actuarial model to assist
management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the
actuarial model.

In addition to our general product liability, we have recorded provisions totaling $450.2 million related to
the

Durom

Cup, including $47.0 million in 2013. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the

Durom

Cup.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

– We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may
not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and
intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these
assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we determined our U.S. Spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its
estimated fair value. Fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches. Fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. Fair
value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to our U.S. Spine reporting unit.

As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the U.S. Spine reporting unit of $96.0 million in 2012. See Note 8 to our
consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges and the factors that could lead to further impairment. In 2013, we employed a similar combination of



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

income and market approaches to estimate this reporting unit’s fair value and determined there was no impairment charge in 2013.

We have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. We estimated the fair value of those reporting units using the
income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit, or by doing a qualitative assessment of changes in fair value from the prior year’s income approach. Since in the past we have incurred
goodwill impairment charges for our U.S. Spine reporting unit, which required us to decrease goodwill to its implied fair value, the estimated fair value of this reporting unit did not substantially exceed its carrying value. Additionally, due to
challenging market conditions associated with our U.S. Dental reporting unit, that reporting unit’s estimated fair value did not substantially exceed its carrying value either. These two reporting units remain sensitive to changes in market
conditions which could result in goodwill being impaired in the future. For each of our other four reporting units, the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value.

Share-based Payment –

We measure share-based payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and
recognize expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock.
Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded options on our stock. The expected life of stock options and
estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected forfeitures represent management’s best estimates.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements to see how recent accounting pronouncements have affected or may affect our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market
risks as part of our ongoing business operations, including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices that could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We manage our
exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools and not for speculative
investment purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

We operate on a global basis and
are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to
transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian
Rupees. We manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on transactions
denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. These forward contracts and options are designed to hedge
anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow hedges are
temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings.

For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2013, we had obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish
Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees and purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January 2014 through June 2016. The notional amounts of
outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2013 were $1,574.6 million. The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at
December 31, 2013 were $353.3 million. The weighted average contract rates outstanding at December 31, 2013 were Euro:USD 1.32, Swiss Franc:USD 1.09, USD:Japanese Yen 88.13, British Pound:USD 1.56, USD:Canadian Dollar 1.04, Australian
Dollar:USD 0.94, USD:Korean Won 1,154, USD:Swedish Krona 6.78, USD:Czech Koruna 19.41, USD:Thai Baht 32.06, USD:Taiwan Dollar 29.22, USD:South African Rand 10.05, USD:Russian Ruble 34.47 and USD:Indian Ruppee 62.58.

We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms of hedging
instruments be the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of
hedge instruments. As part of our risk management program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange
rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

outstanding at December 31, 2013 indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the various currencies, with no change in the interest
differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through June 2016, depending on the direction of the change, by the following average approximate amounts (in millions):

Any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation
in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and
losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and transactions being hedged.

We have net assets
in legal entities with non-U.S. Dollar functional currencies of $2,295.6 million at December 31, 2013, primarily in Euros, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars. $1,354.3 million of the net asset exposure at December 31, 2013 relates to
goodwill recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange
contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency. As a result, foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in
earnings are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period.

COMMODITY
PRICE RISK

We
purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months, where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of
market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes. A 10 percent price

change across all these commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

INTEREST RATE RISK

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations
and financial condition. We manage our exposure to interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing activities.

We invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in highly-rated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits. We also have short-term
and long-term investments in highly-rated corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency debt securities, U.S. government treasury funds, municipal bonds, foreign government debt securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The
primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.

We are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents.

We have multiple fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements that we have designated as fair value hedges of the fixed interest rate
obligations on our Senior Notes due 2019 and 2021. The total notional amounts are $250 million and $300 million for the Senior Notes due 2019 and 2021, respectively. On the interest rate swap agreements for the Senior Notes due 2019, we receive a
fixed interest rate of 4.625 percent and pay variable interest equal to the three-month LIBOR plus an average of 133 basis points. On the interest rate swap agreements for the Senior Notes due 2021, we receive a fixed interest rate of 3.375 percent
and pay variable interest equal to the three-month LIBOR plus an average of 99 basis points.

The interest rate swap agreements
are intended to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. The objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash
equivalents.

These derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under GAAP. Changes in the fair value of the
derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument.

Based upon
our overall interest rate exposure as of December 31, 2013, a change of 10 percent in interest rates, assuming the principal amount outstanding remains constant, would not have a material effect on net interest expense. This analysis does
not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment.

CREDIT RISK

Financial
instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash and cash



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, derivative instruments, counterparty transactions and accounts receivable.

We place our investments in highly-rated financial institutions or highly-rated debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to
any one entity. We believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and investments.

We are
exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions or counterparties issuing the debt security fail to perform. However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract
exceed our obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions. We manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties using standard credit guidelines.
We do not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

Our concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade
accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of
business. Substantially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly,
are exposed to their respective business, economic and country specific variables.

Our ability to collect accounts receivable
in some countries depends in part upon the financial stability of these

hospital and healthcare sectors and the respective countries’ national economic and healthcare systems. Most notably, in Europe healthcare is typically sponsored by the government. Since we
sell products to public hospitals in those countries, we are indirectly exposed to government budget constraints. The ongoing financial uncertainties in the Euro zone impact the indirect credit exposure we have to those governments through their
public hospitals. As of December 31, 2013, in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, countries that have been widely recognized as presenting the highest risk, our gross short-term and long-term trade accounts receivable combined were $226.4
million. With allowances for doubtful accounts of $9.5 million recorded in those countries, the net balance was $216.9 million, representing 24 percent of our total consolidated short-term and long-term trade accounts receivable balance, net. Italy
and Spain accounted for $209.7 million of that net amount. We are actively monitoring the situations in these countries. We maintain contact with customers in these countries on a regular basis. We continue to receive payments, albeit at a slower
rate than in the past. We believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate in these countries, as ultimately we believe the governments in these countries will be able to pay. To the extent the respective governments’ ability to fund
their public hospital programs deteriorates, we may have to record significant bad debt expenses in the future.

While we are
exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry in Europe and around the world, there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring
procedures and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Zimmer Holdings,
Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the
company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, the
company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The company’s management
assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, the company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal

Control-Integrated

Framework (1992)

.

Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, the company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, as stated in its report which appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Zimmer Holdings, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework 1992

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

appearing under Part II, Item 7A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

BUSINESS

We design,
develop, manufacture and market orthopaedic reconstructive, spinal and trauma devices, biologics, dental implants and related surgical products. We also provide other healthcare related services. Orthopaedic reconstructive devices restore function
lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in patients who have lost teeth due to trauma or disease. Spinal devices are utilized by orthopaedic
surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural
healing process. Our related surgical products include surgical supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation rehabilitation. We have operations in more than 25 countries and market our products in
more than 100 countries. We operate in a single industry but have three reportable geographic segments, the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.

The words “we,” “us,” “our” and similar words refer to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
Presentation

– The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zimmer Holdings and its subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated. The consolidated financial statements for some of our international subsidiaries are for an annual period that ended on December 25, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Certain amounts in the 2012 and 2011 consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform to the 2013 presentation.

Use of Estimates

–  The consolidated financial
statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

–  The financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for operating results. Unrealized translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. When a
transaction is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary’s functional currency, we recognize a transaction gain or loss when the transaction is settled.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were not significant.

Revenue Recognition

–  We sell product through three principal channels: 1) direct to healthcare institutions,
referred to as direct channel accounts; 2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers; and 3) directly to dental practices and dental laboratories. The direct channel accounts represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in
2013. Through this channel, inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers so that products are available when needed for surgical procedures. No revenue is recognized upon the placement of inventory into consignment as we retain
title and maintain the inventory on our balance sheet. Upon implantation, we issue an invoice and revenue is recognized. Pricing for products is generally predetermined by contracts with customers, agents acting on behalf of customer groups or by
government regulatory bodies, depending on the market. Price discounts under group purchasing contracts are generally linked to volume of implant purchases by customer healthcare institutions within a specified group. At negotiated thresholds within
a contract buying period, price discounts may increase.

Sales to stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices
and dental laboratories accounted for approximately 20 percent of our net sales in 2013. With these types of sales, revenue is recognized when title to product passes, either upon shipment of the product or in some cases upon implantation of
the product. Product is generally sold at contractually fixed prices for specified periods. Payment terms vary by customer, but are typically less than 90 days.

If sales incentives are earned by a customer for purchasing a specified amount of our product, we estimate whether such incentives will be achieved and, if so, recognize these incentives as a reduction in
revenue in the same period the underlying revenue transaction is recognized. Occasionally products are returned and, accordingly, we maintain an estimated sales return reserve that is recorded as a reduction in revenue. Product returns were not
significant for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Taxes collected from customers and remitted to
governmental authorities are presented on a net basis and excluded from revenues.

Shipping and
Handling

– Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling of products are reflected in net sales and are not significant. Expenses incurred related to shipping and handling of products are reflected in selling, general and
administrative and were $163.6 million, $139.5 million and $142.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Research and Development

–  We expense all research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs include salaries, prototypes, depreciation of equipment used in
research and development, consultant fees and service

fees paid to collaborative partners. Where contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under research and development arrangements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when
the milestone results are achieved.

Litigation

– We record a liability for contingent losses, including
future legal costs, settlements and judgments, when we consider it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Special Items

– We recognize expenses resulting directly from our business combinations, employee termination benefits, certain R&D agreements, certain contract terminations,
consulting and professional fees and asset impairment or loss on disposal charges connected with global restructuring, operational and quality excellence initiatives, and other items as “Special items” in our consolidated statement of
earnings. “Special items” included (in millions):

Impairment/ loss on disposal of assets relates to impairment of intangible assets that were acquired in
business combinations or impairment of or a loss on the disposal of other assets.

Consulting and professional fees relate to
third-party consulting, professional fees and contract labor related to our quality and operational excellence initiatives, third-party consulting fees related to certain information system implementations, third-party integration consulting
performed in a variety of areas such as tax, compliance, logistics and human resources for our business combinations, third-party fees related to severance and termination benefits matters and legal fees related to certain product liability matters.
Our quality and operational excellence initiatives are company-wide and include improvements in quality, distribution, sourcing, manufacturing and information technology, among other areas.

In 2013, 2012 and 2011, we eliminated positions as we reduced management layers, restructured certain areas, announced closures of certain
facilities, and commenced initiatives to focus on business opportunities that best support our strategic priorities. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, approximately 170, 400 and 500 positions, respectively, from across the globe were affected by these
actions. As a result of these changes in our work force and headcount reductions in connection with

acquisitions, we incurred expenses related to severance benefits, redundant salaries as we worked through transition periods, share-based compensation acceleration and other employee
termination-related costs. The majority of these termination benefits were provided in accordance with our existing or local government policies and are considered ongoing benefits. These costs were accrued when they became probable and estimable
and were recorded as part of other current liabilities. The majority of these costs were paid during the year they were incurred.

Dedicated project personnel expenses include the salary, benefits, travel expenses and other costs directly associated with employees who are 100 percent dedicated to our operational and quality
excellence initiatives or integration of acquired businesses.

Certain R&D agreements relate to agreements with upfront
payments to obtain intellectual property to be used in R&D projects that have no alternative future use in other projects.

Relocated facilities expenses are the moving costs and the lease expenses incurred during the relocation period in connection with
relocating certain facilities.

Over the past few years we have acquired a number of U.S. and foreign-based distributors. We
have incurred various costs related to the consummation and integration of those businesses.

Certain litigation matters relate
to costs and adjustments recognized during the year for the estimated or actual settlement of various legal matters, including royalty disputes, patent litigation matters, commercial litigation matters and matters arising from our acquisitions of
certain competitive distributorships in prior years.

Contract termination costs relate to terminated agreements in connection
with the integration of acquired companies and changes to our distribution model as part of business restructuring and operational excellence initiatives. The terminated contracts primarily relate to sales agents and distribution agreements.

Contingent consideration adjustments represent the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations to be
paid to the prior owners of acquired businesses.

Accelerated software amortization is the incremental amortization resulting
from a reduction in the estimated life of certain software. In 2012, we approved a plan to replace certain software. As a result, the estimated economic useful life of the existing software was decreased to represent the period of time expected to
implement replacement software. As a result, the amortization from the shortened life of this software is substantially higher than the previous amortization being recognized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

– We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in the
balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents are valued at cost, which approximates their fair value.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

Investments

– We invest our excess cash and cash equivalents in debt
securities. Our investments include corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency debt securities, foreign government debt securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit, and are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Investments with a contractual maturity of less than one year are classified as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheet, or in other
non-current assets if the contractual maturity is greater than one year. Changes in fair value for available-for-sale securities are recorded, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet. We
review our investments for other-than-temporary impairment at each reporting period. If an unrealized loss for any investment is considered to be other-than-temporary, the loss will be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in the
period the determination is made. See Note 7 for more information regarding our investments.

Accounts
Receivable

– Accounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables. We grant credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses. We
determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by geographic market and take into consideration historical credit experience, creditworthiness of the customer and other pertinent information. We make concerted efforts to collect all accounts
receivable, but sometimes we have to write-off the account against the allowance when we determine the account is uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $22.7 million and $22.8 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.

Inventories

– Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined
on a first-in first-out basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

– Property, plant and equipment is carried
at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and improvements and three to eight years for machinery and equipment. Maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred. We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
estimated future undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset are less than its carrying amount. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value.

Software Costs

– We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with
developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs generally include external direct costs of
materials and services utilized in developing or

obtaining computer software and compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software project. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant
and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line or weighted average estimated user basis when the software is ready for its intended use over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate three to fifteen years.

Instruments

– Instruments are hand-held devices used by surgeons during total joint replacement and
other surgical procedures. Instruments are recognized as long-lived assets and are included in property, plant and equipment. Undeployed instruments are carried at cost or realizable value. Instruments in the field are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on average estimated useful lives, determined principally in reference to associated product life cycles, primarily five years. We review instruments for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an instrument may not be recoverable. Depreciation of instruments is recognized as selling, general and administrative expense.

Goodwill

– Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill has been assigned to
reporting units. We perform annual impairment tests by either comparing a reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying amount or doing a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit’s fair value from the last quantitative assessment
to determine if there is potential impairment. We may do a qualitative assessment when the results of the previous quantitative test indicated the reporting unit’s estimated fair value was significantly in excess of the carrying value of its
net assets and we do not believe there have been significant changes in the reporting unit’s operations that would significantly decrease its estimated fair value or significantly increase its net assets. If a quantitative assessment is
performed, the fair value of the reporting unit and the implied fair value of goodwill are determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and/or use of a market approach by looking at market values of comparable companies. Significant
assumptions are incorporated into our discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth rates and risk-adjusted discount rates. We perform this test in the fourth quarter of the year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of the reporting unit’s assets may not be recoverable. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the reporting unit
goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $96.0 million related to our U.S. Spine reporting unit. We did not record a goodwill
impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2013. See Notes 8 and 9 for more information regarding goodwill and goodwill impairment.

Intangible Assets

– Intangible assets are initially measured at their
fair value. We have determined the fair value of our intangible assets either by the fair value of the consideration exchanged for the intangible asset or the estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the
intangible asset. Intangible assets with an indefinite life, including certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized. Indefinite life intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support
an indefinite life. Intangible assets with a finite life, including core and developed technology, certain trademarks and trade names, customer-related intangibles, intellectual property rights and patents and licenses are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, ranging from less than one year to 40 years. Intangible assets with a finite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable.

Intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be determined based upon the
excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. The fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis using the relief from royalty method or a qualitative assessment may be
performed for any changes to the asset’s fair value from the last quantitative assessment. The relief from royalty method estimates the cost savings associated with owning, rather than licensing, assets. Significant assumptions are incorporated
into these discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth rates, royalty rates and risk-adjusted discount rates. We may do a qualitative assessment when the results of the previous quantitative test indicated that the asset’s fair value
was significantly in excess of its carrying value.

In determining the useful lives of intangible assets, we consider the
expected use of the assets and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, anticipated technological advances, changes in surgical techniques, market influences and other economic factors. For technology-based intangible assets, we consider
the expected life cycles of products, absent unforeseen technological advances, which incorporate the corresponding technology. Trademarks and trade names that do not have a wasting characteristic (i.e., there are no legal, regulatory, contractual,
competitive, economic or other factors which limit the useful life) are assigned an indefinite life. Trademarks and trade names that are related to products expected to be phased out are assigned lives consistent with the period in which the
products bearing each brand are expected to be sold. For customer relationship intangible assets, we assign useful lives based upon historical levels of customer attrition. Intellectual property rights are assigned useful lives that approximate the
contractual life of any related

patent or the period for which we maintain exclusivity over the intellectual property.

Income Taxes

– We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and
recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would
reduce the provision for income taxes. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S.

We operate on a global basis and are subject to numerous and complex tax laws and regulations. Our income tax filings are regularly under audit in multiple federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Income
tax audits may require an extended period of time to reach resolution and may result in significant income tax adjustments when interpretation of tax laws or allocation of company profits is disputed. Because income tax adjustments in certain
jurisdictions can be significant, we record accruals representing management’s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised
estimated probable outcome.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– We measure all derivative instruments at
fair value and report them on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. We maintain written policies and procedures that permit, under appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization, the use of derivative financial
instruments solely for hedging purposes. The use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes is prohibited by our policy. See Note 13 for more information regarding our derivative and hedging activities.

Other Comprehensive Income

– Other comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net earnings as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. Other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign
currency translation adjustments,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses in
actuarial assumptions.

Treasury Stock

– We account for repurchases of common stock under the cost method
and present treasury stock as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. We reissue common stock held in treasury only for limited purposes.

Noncontrolling Interest

– In 2011, we made an investment in a company in which we acquired a controlling financial interest, but not 100 percent of the equity. In 2013, we purchased
additional shares of the company from the minority shareholders. Further information related to the noncontrolling interests of that investment has not been provided as it is not significant to our consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Pronouncements

– Effective January 1, 2013, we adopted the FASB’s Accounting Standard Updates
(ASUs) requiring reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and balance sheet offsetting between derivative assets and liabilities. These ASUs only change financial statement disclosure requirements and
therefore do not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 12 for disclosures relating to OCI. See Note 13 for disclosures relating to balance sheet offsetting.

There are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that are expected to have a material effect on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

3.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Our share-based
payments primarily consist of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), and an employee stock purchase plan. Share-based compensation expense is as follows (in millions):

Share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory for the years ended December 31, 2013,
2012 and 2011 was $4.1 million, $6.1 million, and $8.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, approximately $2.4 million and $3.3 million of capitalized costs remained in finished goods inventory.

Stock Options

We had two equity compensation plans in effect at December 31, 2013: the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (2009 Plan) and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2009 Plan succeeded the 2006 Stock
Incentive Plan (2006 Plan) and the TeamShare Stock Option Plan (TeamShare Plan). No further awards have been granted under the 2006 Plan or under the TeamShare Plan since May 2009, and shares remaining available for grant under those plans have been
merged into the 2009 Plan. Vested and unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock and RSUs previously granted under the 2006 Plan, the TeamShare Plan and another prior plan, the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, remained outstanding as of
December 31, 2013. We have reserved the maximum number of shares of common stock available for award under the terms of each of these plans. We have registered 57.9 million shares of common stock under these plans. The 2009 Plan
provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options, long-term performance awards in the form of performance shares or units, restricted stock, RSUs and stock appreciation rights. The Compensation and Management
Development Committee of the Board of Directors determines the grant date for annual grants under our equity compensation plans. The date for annual grants under the 2009 Plan to our executive officers is expected to occur in the first quarter of
each year following the earnings announcements for the previous quarter and full year. The Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides for awards of stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to non-employee directors. It has been our practice to
issue shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options from previously unissued shares, except in limited circumstances where they are issued from treasury stock. The total number of awards which may be granted in a given year and/or over the
life of the plan under each of our equity compensation plans is limited. At December 31, 2013, an aggregate of 10.4 million shares were available for future grants and awards under these plans.

Stock options granted to date under our plans generally vest over four years and generally have a maximum contractual life of 10 years. As
established under our equity compensation plans, vesting may accelerate upon retirement after the first anniversary date of the award if certain criteria are met. We recognize expense related to stock options on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period, less awards expected to be forfeited using estimated forfeiture rates. Due to the accelerated retirement provisions, the requisite service period of our stock options range from one to four years. Stock options are granted
with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, except in limited circumstances where local law may dictate otherwise.

(Continued)

A summary of stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 is as
follows (options in thousands):

We use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock
options. For stock options granted in 2012 and 2011, expected volatility was derived from the implied volatility of traded options on our stock that were actively traded around the grant date of the stock options with exercise prices similar to the
stock options and maturities of over one year. In 2013, we used a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility because the traded options that were actively traded around the grant date of our stock options did not have maturities of
over one year. The expected term of the stock options has been derived from historical employee exercise behavior. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a
remaining term approximating the expected life of the options. We began paying dividends in 2012. Accordingly, prior to 2012 we assumed no dividend yield. Starting in 2012, the dividend yield was determined by using an estimated annual dividend and
dividing it by the market price of our stock on the grant date.

The following table presents information regarding the weighted average fair value for
stock options granted, the assumptions used to determine fair value, and the intrinsic value of options exercised in the indicated year:

As of December 31, 2013, there was $33.5 million of unrecognized share-based payment expense
related to nonvested stock options granted under our plans. That expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.7 years.

RSUs

We have
awarded RSUs to our employees. The terms of the awards have been three to five years. Some of the awards have only service conditions while some have performance and market conditions as well. The service condition awards vest ratably on the
anniversary date of the award. The awards that have performance and market conditions vest all at once on the third anniversary date. Future service conditions may be waived if an employee retires after the first anniversary date of the award, but
performance and market conditions continue to apply. Accordingly, the requisite service period used for share-based payment expense on our RSUs range from one to five years.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

A summary of nonvested RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows
(RSUs in thousands):

For the RSUs with service conditions only, the fair value of the awards was determined based upon the fair
market value of our common stock on the date of grant. For the RSUs with market conditions, a Monte Carlo valuation technique was used to simulate the market conditions of the awards. The outcome of the simulation was used to determine the fair
value of the awards.

We are required to estimate the number of RSUs that will vest and recognize share-based payment expense
on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2013, we estimate that approximately 875,900 outstanding RSUs will vest. If our estimate were to change in the future, the cumulative effect of the change in
estimate will be recorded in that period. Based upon the number of RSUs that we expect to vest, the unrecognized share-based payment expense as of December 31, 2013 was $34.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.2 years. The fair value of RSUs vesting during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 based upon our stock price on the date of vesting was $32.5 million, $18.9 million and $11.8 million, respectively.

ACQUISITIONS

We made a number of business acquisitions during the years 2013, 2012 and 2011. In May 2013, we acquired the business assets of Knee Creations, LLC (Knee Creations). The Knee Creations acquisition
enhances our product portfolio of early intervention knee treatments. In June 2013, we acquired NORMED Medizin-Technik GmbH (Normed). The Normed acquisition strengthens our Extremities and Trauma product portfolios and brings new product development
capabilities in the foot and ankle and hand and wrist markets. In January 2012, we acquired Synvasive Technology, Inc. (Synvasive). The Synvasive acquisition enhances our product portfolio through the addition of the

for soft tissue balancing. In October 2012, we
acquired Dornoch Medical Systems, Inc. (Dornoch). The Dornoch acquisition enhances our product portfolio through the addition of a medical waste fluid management and disposal technology. In November 2011, we acquired ExtraOrtho, Inc. (ExtraOrtho).
The ExtraOrtho acquisition enhances our position in the external fixation market.

The results of operations of the acquired
companies have been included in our consolidated results of operations subsequent to the transaction dates, and the respective assets and liabilities of the acquired companies have been recorded at their estimated fair values in our consolidated
statement of financial position as of the transaction dates, with any excess purchase price being recorded as goodwill. Pro forma financial information and other information required have not been included as the acquisitions, individually and in
the aggregate, did not have a material impact upon our financial position or results of operations.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

The following
financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

We value our available-for-sale securities using a market approach based on broker prices for identical
assets in over-the-counter markets and we perform ongoing assessments of counterparty credit risk.

We value our foreign
currency forward contracts and foreign currency options using a market approach based on foreign currency exchange rates obtained from active markets and we perform ongoing assessments of counterparty credit risk.

We value our interest rate swaps using a market approach based on publicly available market yield curves and the terms of our swaps and we
perform ongoing assessments of counterparty credit risk.

The following nonfinancial assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (in
millions):

We conduct our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of every year or whenever events
occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. In 2012, it was determined that our U.S. Spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its fair value.
The goodwill for this reporting unit was written down to its implied fair value of $41.0 million from its previous carrying value of $137.0 million, resulting in a $96.0 million non-cash impairment charge. The implied fair value of goodwill equals
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit minus the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets. In determining the implied fair value of the U.S. Spine reporting unit’s goodwill, we used unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value
of the reporting unit and its assets and liabilities. Fair value was determined using an equal weighting of income and market approaches.

Fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. Fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline
public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators from publicly traded companies that are similar to our U.S. Spine reporting unit and considers control premiums that would result from a sale of the reporting unit and the level of assets
in the reporting unit versus the comparable companies.

In estimating the future cash flows of the reporting unit, we utilized
a combination of market and company specific inputs that a market participant would use in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. The primary market input was revenue growth rates. These rates were based upon historical trends and estimated
future growth drivers such as an aging global population, obesity and more active lifestyles. Significant company specific inputs included assumptions regarding how the reporting unit could leverage operating expenses as revenue grows and the impact
any new products will have on revenues.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC.

2013 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

Under the guideline public company methodology, we took into consideration specific risk
differences between our reporting unit and the comparable companies, such as recent financial performance, size risks and product portfolios, among other considerations. Based upon our reporting unit’s recent financial performance, market share
and product portfolio, we valued the reporting unit near the bottom of the valuation indicators of the comparable companies.

The fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities were determined by using the same methods that are used in business
combination purchase accounting.

Factors that contributed to impairment of the U.S. Spine reporting unit included broader
market issues as well as company specific issues. The U.S. spine market was and continues to be under pressure due to a constrained economic environment leading to continuing high unemployment and payer pushback on the necessity of certain
procedures. Additionally, pricing was and continues to decline across the industry. Company specific issues included turnover with our independent sales agents and lack of execution in developing new, competitive products which resulted in a less
than optimal product portfolio in our U.S. Spine reporting unit.

Before the economic downturn in 2008, we estimated the U.S.
spine market was growing in the low double digits, but declined to flat or in the low single digits in 2012. Previous goodwill impairment tests forecasted some recovery in the market which did not occur. As we completed our annual operating plan in
the fourth quarter of 2012, it became clearer that the U.S. spine market recovery may take longer than we planned, including the persistence of significant negative pricing pressures. Additionally, we concluded that new product introductions made in
2012 would not have as significant of a positive effect as we had previously forecasted. As a result, we tempered our expectations of recovery in the U.S. market and for our U.S. Spine reporting unit and recognized an impairment charge.

In our 2013 annual goodwill impairment test of our U.S. Spine reporting unit, we concluded no impairment charge was necessary. While our
estimated fair value of the reporting unit declined slightly, the net assets of the reporting unit declined by more. The decrease in the net assets was primarily due to continued amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations
and lower working capital needs. However, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit did not substantially exceed its carrying value.

We have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. We estimate the fair value of those reporting units using the income approach by discounting to present value the estimated future
cash flows of the reporting unit. Due to challenging market conditions associated with our U.S. Dental reporting unit, that reporting unit’s estimated fair value did not substantially exceed its carrying value in our 2013 goodwill
impairment test. For each of the other four reporting units, the estimated fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value.

We will continue to monitor the fair value of our U.S. Spine and U.S. Dental reporting
units as well as our other four reporting units in our interim and annual reporting periods. If estimated cash flows for these reporting units decrease, we may be required to record further impairment charges in the future. Factors that could
result in our cash flows being lower than our current estimates include: 1) decreased revenues caused by unforeseen changes in the healthcare market, or our inability to generate new product revenue from our research and development activities, and
2) our inability to achieve the estimated operating margins in our forecasts due to unforeseen factors. Additionally, changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates or comparable company
valuation indicators, which may impact our estimated fair values.

In 2013 and 2012, we also recorded $2.8 million and $11.6
million, respectively, of impairment charges in “Special items” related to certain indefinite lived intangible assets. The impairment was a result of lower future estimated revenues from products using certain trademarks. The lower future
estimated revenue resulted from negative publicity in the marketplace related to certain hip devices and our challenges in the global spine market that have adversely affected sales of these products. Further information regarding how the fair value
of these indefinite lived trademarks was determined has not been provided as we do not believe this non-cash charge was significant to our results for 2013 and 2012.

DEBT

Our debt
consisted of the following (in millions):

We have a five year $1,350 million revolving, multi-currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing
May 9, 2017 (Senior Credit Facility). There were no borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2013.

We have a term loan agreement (Term Loan) with one of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility for 11.7 billion Japanese Yen that will mature on May 31, 2016. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear
interest at a fixed rate of 0.61 percent per annum until maturity. The estimated fair value of the Term Loan as of December 31, 2013, based upon publicly available market yield curves and the terms of the debt (Level 2), was $112.2
million.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit rating and the amounts drawn under the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate
base rate, or at a fixed-rate determined through a competitive bid process. The Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among other things,
limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales or transfers of assets. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. If we fall below an investment grade credit rating, additional restrictions would result, including
restrictions on investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2013. Commitments under the Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain
fees, including a facility and a utilization fee.

We have four tranches of senior notes outstanding: $250 million aggregate principal amount
of 1.4 percent notes due November 30, 2014, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent notes due November 30, 2019, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 percent notes due November 30, 2021 and $500 million
aggregate principal amount of 5.75 percent notes due November 30, 2039. Interest on each series is payable on May 30 and November 30 of each year until maturity. The estimated fair value of our Senior Notes as of December 31,
2013, based on quoted prices for the specific securities from transactions in over-the-counter markets (Level 2), was $1,649.5 million.

We may redeem the Senior Notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1) 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being
redeemed; or 2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a
semi-annual basis at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 15 basis points in the case of the 2014 Notes, 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 Notes. We would
also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to the redemption date.

We have entered into interest rate swap
agreements which we designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed-rate obligations on our Senior Notes due 2019 and 2021. See Note 13 for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreements.

Before our senior notes due November 30, 2014 become payable, we intend to issue new senior notes in order to pay the $250 million
owed. If we are not able to issue new senior notes, we intend to borrow against our Senior Credit Facility to pay these notes. Since we have the ability and intent to refinance these senior notes on a long-term basis with new notes or through our
Senior Credit Facility, we have classified these senior notes as long-term debt as of December 31, 2013.

We also have
available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $50.7 million.

At December 31, 2013, the weighted average interest
rate for our long-term borrowings was 3.3 percent. At December 31, 2012, the weighted average interest rate for short-term and long-term borrowings was 1.1 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. We paid $68.1 million, $67.8 million and $55.0
million in interest during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

OCI refers to
certain gains and losses that under GAAP are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net earnings as these amounts are initially recorded as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. Amounts in OCI may be reclassified to net
earnings upon the occurrence of certain events.

Our OCI is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and
losses on cash flow hedges, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, and amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses in actuarial assumptions on our defined benefit plans. Foreign currency translation
adjustments are reclassified to net earnings upon sale or upon a complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity. Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges are reclassified to net earnings when the hedged
item affects net earnings. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reclassified to net earnings if we sell the security before maturity or if the unrealized loss is considered to be other-than-temporary. We typically hold
our available-for-sale securities until maturity and are able to realize their amortized cost and therefore we do not have reclassification adjustments to net earnings on these securities. Amounts related to defined benefit plans that are in OCI are
reclassified over the service periods of employees in the plan. The reclassification amounts are allocated to all employees in the plans and therefore the reclassified amounts may become part of inventory to the extent they are considered direct
labor costs. See Note 14 for more information on our defined benefit plans.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We are exposed
to certain market risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular
operating and financing activities. Currently, the only risks that we manage through the use of derivative instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Interest Rate Risk

Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges

We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixed-rate debt into
variable-rate debt. Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by

reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The objective of the instruments is to more closely align interest expense with interest income received on cash and cash equivalents. These
derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges under GAAP. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in current earnings and are offset by gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument.

We have multiple fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements that we have designated as fair value hedges of the fixed interest rate
obligations on our Senior Notes due 2019 and 2021. The total notional amounts are $250 million and $300 million for the Senior Notes due 2019 and 2021, respectively. On the interest rate swap agreements for the Senior Notes due 2019, we receive a
fixed interest rate of 4.625 percent and pay variable interest equal to the three-month LIBOR plus an average of 133 basis points. On the interest rate swap agreements for the Senior Notes due 2021, we receive a fixed interest rate of 3.375 percent
and pay variable interest equal to the three-month LIBOR plus an average of 99 basis points.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be
adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To reduce the potential effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on net earnings, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange
forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian
Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

Our revenues are generated in various currencies throughout the world. However, a significant amount of our inventory is produced in U.S. Dollars. Therefore, movements in foreign currency exchange rates
may have different proportional effects on our revenues compared to our cost of products sold. To minimize the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on cash flows, we hedge intercompany sales of inventory expected to occur within the
next 30 months with foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options. We designate these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges.

We perform quarterly assessments of hedge effectiveness by verifying and documenting the critical terms of the hedge instrument and that forecasted transactions have not changed significantly. We also
assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been adverse developments regarding the risk of a counterparty default. For derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily
recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value, if any, is immediately reported in cost of products
sold.

For foreign currency exchange forward contracts and options outstanding at December 31, 2013, we had obligations to
purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees and

obligations to purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars. These derivatives mature at dates ranging from January 2014 through June 2016. As of December 31, 2013, the notional amounts of
outstanding forward contracts and options entered into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars were $1,574.6 million. As of December 31, 2013, the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts and options entered into with third parties
to purchase Swiss Francs were $353.3 million.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency. As a result, any foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward
exchange contracts in the same reporting period. These offsetting gains/losses are recorded in cost of products sold as the underlying assets and liabilities exposed to remeasurement include inventory-related transactions. These contracts are
settled on the last day of each reporting period. Therefore, there is no outstanding balance related to these contracts recorded on the balance sheet as of the end of the reporting period. The notional amounts of these contracts are typically in a
range of $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion per quarter.

Foreign Currency Exchange and Interest Rate Risk

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

In 2011, our subsidiary in Japan, with a functional currency of Japanese Yen, borrowed variable-rate debt of $143.0 million denominated in U.S. Dollars under our previous credit facility. To manage the
foreign currency exchange risk associated with remeasuring the debt to Japanese Yen and the interest rate risk associated with the variable-rate debt, we entered into multiple cross-currency interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount
of 11,798 million Japanese Yen. We designated these swaps as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks. The effective portion of changes in fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps was temporarily
recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in interest expense when the hedged item affected net earnings. The cross-currency interest rate swap agreements matured in 2012 and we paid off the subsidiary’s U.S. Dollar debt
with Japanese Yen debt borrowed under our previous credit facility.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We have defined

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on the historical and estimated future rates
of return on the different asset classes held in the plans. The expected long-term rate of return is the weighted average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset class. We believe that historical asset results approximate expected
market returns applicable to the funding of a long-term benefit obligation.

Discount rates were determined for each of our
defined benefit retirement plans at their measurement date to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefit payments.

The U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement plans’ overall investment strategy is to
maximize total returns by emphasizing long-term growth of capital while mitigating risk. We have established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 40 to 45 percent for equity securities, 30 to 35 percent for debt securities and 20
to 25 percent in non-traditional investments. The plans strive to have sufficiently diversified assets so that adverse or unexpected results from one asset class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We regularly review
the investments in the plans and we may rebalance them from time-to-time based upon the target asset allocation of the plans.

For the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans, we maintain an investment policy statement that
guides the investment allocation in the plans. The investment policy statement describes the target asset allocation positions described above. Our benefits committee, along with our investment advisor, monitor compliance with and administer the
investment policy statement and the plans’ assets and oversee the general investment strategy and objectives of the plans. Our benefits committee generally meets quarterly to review performance and to ensure that the current investment
allocation is within the parameters of the investment policy statement.

The investment strategies of foreign based plans
vary according to the plan provisions and local laws. The majority of the assets in foreign based plans are located in Switzerland-based plans. These assets are held in trusts and are commingled with the assets of other Swiss companies with
representatives of all the companies making the investment decisions. The overall strategy is to maximize total returns while avoiding risk. The trustees of the assets have established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 30 to 50 percent in
debt securities, 20 to 37 percent in equity securities, 15 to 24 percent in real estate, 3 to 15 percent in cash funds and 0 to 12 percent in other funds.

As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our defined benefit pension plans’ assets did
not hold any direct investment in Zimmer Holdings common stock.

Equity securities are valued using a market approach, based on
quoted prices for the specific security from transactions in active exchange markets (Level 1), or in some cases where we are invested in mutual or collective funds, based upon the net asset value per unit of the fund which is determined from quoted
market prices of the underlying securities in the fund’s portfolio (Level 2). Fixed income securities are valued using a market approach, based upon quoted prices for the specific security or from institutional bid evaluations. Some fixed
income securities are in funds with a net asset value per unit which is determined using similar techniques for the underlying securities in the fund’s portfolio. Real estate is valued by discounting to present value the cash flows expected to
be generated by the specific properties.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of
our foreign pension plan assets measured at fair value that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):

We expect that we will have no legally required minimum funding requirements in 2014 for the qualified
U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement plans. We expect to voluntarily contribute approximately $2.0 million to these plans during 2014. Contributions to foreign defined benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $14.0 million in 2014.
We do not expect the assets in any of our plans to be returned to us in the next year.

Defined Contribution Plans

We also sponsor defined contribution plans for substantially all of the U.S. and Puerto Rico employees and certain employees in other
countries. The benefits offered under these plans are reflective of local customs and practices in the countries concerned. We expensed $29.6 million, $26.5 million and $25.7 million related to these plans for the years ended December 31,

The components of deferred taxes consisted of the following (in millions):

The net operating loss carryovers are available to reduce future federal, state and foreign taxable
earnings. At December 31, 2013, these net operating loss carryovers generally expire within a period of 1 to 20 years. Valuation allowances for net operating loss carryovers have been established in the amount of $17.3 million and $17.0 million
at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The tax credit carryovers are available to offset future federal, state and foreign tax liabilities. At December 31, 2013, these tax credit carryovers generally expire within a period of 1 to 10
years. We have established valuation allowances for certain tax credit carryovers in the amount of $14.9 million and $14.2 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The capital loss carryover is also available to reduce future
federal capital gains. At December 31, 2013 these capital loss carryovers generally expire within a period of 4 to 5 years. We have established valuation allowances for certain capital loss carryovers in the amount of $7.8 million and $4.0
million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The remaining valuation allowances of $2.7 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, relate primarily to potential capital losses.

At December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate of approximately $3,354 million of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have
been, or are intended to be, indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. If the total undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted, a significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the allowable
foreign tax credits. It is not practical for us to determine the additional tax related to remitting these earnings.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits
(in millions):

We recognize accrued interest and penalties, related to unrecognized tax benefits, as income tax expense.
During 2013, we accrued interest and penalties of $8.2 million, and as of December 31, 2013, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $42.1 million.

During 2012, we accrued interest and penalties of $23.2 million, and as of December 31, 2012, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $33.9 million. We decreased interest and
penalties by $12.1 million during 2011, and as of December 31, 2011, had recognized a liability for interest and penalties of $10.7 million.

We operate on a global basis and are subject to numerous and complex tax laws and regulations. Our income tax filings are regularly under audit in multiple federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Income
tax audits may require an extended period of time to reach resolution and may result in significant income tax adjustments when interpretation of tax laws or allocation of company profits is disputed. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits may
change within the next twelve months between $0 and $60 million due to changes in audit status, expiration of statutes of limitations, settlements of tax assessments and other events which could impact our determination of unrecognized tax benefits.

During the second quarter of 2011, the IRS concluded their examination of our U.S. federal returns for years 2005 through 2007
and during the fourth quarter of 2013, the IRS concluded their examination of our U.S. federal returns for years 2008 through 2009. For years 2006 through 2009, the IRS has proposed adjustments reallocating profits between certain of our U.S. and
foreign subsidiaries. We have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the IRS. Although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, we anticipate that within the next twelve months
we may settle certain tax matters with the IRS, and pay amounts for other unresolved tax matters in order to limit the potential impact of IRS interest charges. Final resolution of these matters could have a material impact on our income tax
expense, results of operations, and cash flows for future periods.

authorized to issue 250 million shares of preferred stock, none of which were issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2013.

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is net earnings available to common stockholders. The denominator for basic earnings per share is the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. The denominator for diluted earnings per share is weighted average shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options and other equity awards. The following is a reconciliation of weighted average

of 11.9 million and 13.2 million options, respectively, were not included.

During 2013, we repurchased
9.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $78.88 per share for a total cash outlay of $719.0 million, including commissions. Effective January 1, 2014, we have a new share repurchase program that authorizes purchases of
up to $1.0 billion with no expiration date. No further purchases will be made under the previous share repurchase program.

SEGMENT DATA

We design,
develop, manufacture and market orthopaedic reconstructive implants, biologics, dental implants, spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical products which include surgical supplies and instruments designed to aid in surgical procedures
and post-operation rehabilitation. We also provide other healthcare-related services. We manage operations through three major geographic segments – the Americas, which is comprised principally of the U.S. and includes other North, Central and
South American markets; Europe, which is comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and African markets; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan and includes other Asian and Pacific markets. This structure is the
basis for our reportable segment information discussed below. Management evaluates reportable segment performance based upon segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses pertaining to share-based payment expense, inventory step-up and
certain other inventory and manufacturing related charges, “Certain claims,” goodwill impairment, “Special items,” and global operations and corporate functions. Global operations and corporate functions include research,
development engineering, medical education, brand management, corporate legal, finance, and human resource functions, U.S., Puerto Rico and Ireland-based manufacturing operations and logistics and intangible asset amortization resulting from
business combination accounting. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated from segment operating profit. Management reviews accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets by reportable segment
exclusive of U.S., Puerto Rico and Ireland-based manufacturing operations and logistics and corporate assets.

The Americas long-lived tangible assets are located primarily in the U.S. $211.6 million of
Europe long-lived tangible assets as of December 31, 2013 are located in Switzerland.

For segment reporting purposes,
deployed instruments are included in the measurement of reportable segment assets while undeployed instruments at U.S., Puerto Rico and Ireland-based manufacturing operations and logistics are included in global operations and corporate functions.
The majority of instruments are purchased by U.S., Puerto Rico and Ireland-based manufacturing operations and logistics and are deployed to the reportable segments as needed for the business. Therefore, the reportable segment assets include deployed
instruments even though that reportable segment may not report the instrument addition.

U.S. sales were $2,418.2 million,
$2,280.7 million and $2,263.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Sales within any other individual country were less than 10 percent of our consolidated sales. Sales are attributable to a country based
upon the customer’s country of domicile.

Beginning in 2013, our Knees product category net sales include certain early
intervention products that are primarily used in knee procedures. In 2012 and 2011, these products were included in the Surgical and other product category. Net sales in the 2012 and 2011 periods related to these products have been reclassified to
conform to the 2013 presentation. Net sales by product category are as follows (in millions):

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Product Liability-Related Claims

We are subject to product liability claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We establish standard accruals
for product liability claims in conjunction with outside counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for open claims, related legal fees and claims incurred but not reported. These standard product liability accruals
are recognized in selling, general and administrative expense. We may also establish provisions for certain product liability claims outside of the standard accruals that are recorded separately on our statement of earnings, such as the provision
for claims related to the

Durom

Cup discussed below. We maintain insurance, subject to self-insured retention requirements, for losses from these and other claims.

On July 22, 2008, we temporarily suspended marketing and distribution of the

Durom

Cup in the U.S. Subsequently, a number of product liability lawsuits and other claims have been asserted
against us. We have settled some of these claims and the others are still pending. Additional claims may be asserted in the future.

Initially, we estimated that any revision surgeries required would manifest themselves within two years of the original surgery. In the second quarter of 2010, based upon more recent claims information
available, we revised our estimate to include all claims for revisions of original surgeries performed before July 22, 2008 (i.e., before our temporary suspension) on a worldwide basis, regardless of the amount of time between the revision
surgery and the original surgery. In the fourth quarter of 2011, as additional claims information became available, we revised our estimates and methodology again to consolidate all estimated liabilities associated with

Durom

Cup-related
claims regardless of whether the original surgery occurred before or after our temporary sales suspension. We recognized estimated claims that met the parameters noted in this paragraph during that time period as “Certain claims” on

our statement of earnings. We recognized estimated claims outside these parameters as part of selling, general and administrative expense. The following table shows the line of our statement of
earnings and the period in which

As noted above, we maintain insurance for product liability claims, subject to self-insurance retention
requirements. In 2008, we notified our insurance carriers of potential claims related to the

Durom

Cup. Based upon our most recent estimates for liabilities associated with the

Durom

Cup, as detailed above, we believe we may exhaust
our self-insured retention under our insurance program. In this event, we would have a claim for insurance proceeds for ultimate losses which exceed the self-insured retention amount, subject to a 20 percent co-payment requirement and a cap. We
believe our contracts with the insurance carriers are enforceable for these claims and therefore we believe it is highly probable that we would recover some amount from our insurance carriers if our ultimate losses exceed our self-insured retention.
Accordingly, we have recognized a $218.0 million receivable in “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheet that reduced “Certain claims” expense for estimated insurance recoveries. As is customary in this process, our
insurance carriers have reserved all rights under their respective policies and could still ultimately deny coverage for some or all of our insurance claims.

Our estimate, as of December 31, 2013, of the remaining liability for all

Durom

Cup-related claims is $379.0 million, of which $50.0 million is classified as short-term in “Other current
liabilities” and $329.0 million is classified as long-term in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet. We expect to pay the majority of the

Durom

Cup-related claims within the next five years.

Our understanding of clinical outcomes with the

Durom

Cup and other large diameter hip cups continues to evolve. We
rely on significant estimates in determining the provisions for

Durom

Cup-related claims, including the number of claims that we will receive and the average amount we will pay per claim. The actual number of claims that we receive and the
amount we pay per claim may differ from our estimates. Since our understanding of the clinical outcomes is still evolving, we cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from

Durom

Cup-related claims in
excess of the losses we have accrued.

On August 20, 2008, Margo and Daniel Polett filed an action against us and an
unrelated third party, Public Communications, Inc. (PCI), in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania seeking an unspecified amount of

damages for injuries and loss of consortium allegedly suffered by Mrs. Polett and her spouse, respectively. The complaint alleged that defendants were negligent in connection with
Mrs. Polett’s participation in a promotional video featuring one of our knee products. The case was tried in November 2010 and the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiffs. The jury awarded $27.6 million in compensatory damages and
apportioned fault 30 percent to plaintiffs, 34 percent to us and 36 percent to PCI. Under applicable law, we may be liable for any portion of the damages apportioned to PCI that it does not pay. On December 2, 2010, we and PCI filed a Motion
for Post-Trial Relief seeking a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new trial or a remittitur. On June 10, 2011, the trial court entered an order denying our Motion for Post-Trial Relief and affirming the jury verdict in full and entered
judgment for $20.3 million against us and PCI. On June 29, 2011, we filed a Notice of Appeal to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania and posted a bond for the verdict amount plus interest. Oral argument before the appellate court in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania was held as scheduled on March 13, 2012. On March 1, 2013, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania vacated the $27.6 million judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. On March 15, 2013, plaintiffs filed a motion for
re-argument

en banc

, and on March 28, 2013, we filed our response in opposition

.

On May 9, 2013, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania granted plaintiffs’ motion for re-argument

en banc

. Oral argument
(re-argument

en banc

) before the Superior Court of Pennsylvania was held on October 16, 2013. On December 20, 2013, the Court issued its opinion again vacating the trial court judgment and remanding the case for a new trial. On
January 21, 2014, plaintiffs filed a petition for allowance of appeal in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and on February 4, 2014, we filed our response in opposition. Although we are defending this lawsuit vigorously, its ultimate
resolution is uncertain.

Following a wide-spread advertising campaign conducted by certain law firms beginning in 2010, a
number of product liability lawsuits have been filed against us in various jurisdictions. The plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury, alleging that certain products within the

NexGen

Knee System suffer from defects that cause them to
loosen prematurely. The majority of the cases are currently pending in a federal Multidistrict Litigation in the Northern District of Illinois. Other cases are pending in other state and federal courts, and additional lawsuits may be filed. As of
December 31, 2013, discovery in these lawsuits was underway and no trial dates had been set. We have not accrued an estimated loss relating to these lawsuits because we believe the plaintiffs’ allegations are not consistent with the record
of clinical success for these products. As a result, we do not believe that it is probable that we have incurred a liability, and we cannot reasonably estimate any loss that might eventually be incurred. Although we are vigorously defending these
lawsuits, their ultimate resolution is uncertain.

Intellectual Property-Related Claims

On December 10, 2010, Stryker Corporation and related entities (Stryker) filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Michigan, alleging that certain of our

Pulsavac

Plus Wound Debridement Products infringe three U.S. patents assigned to Stryker. The case was tried beginning on January 15, 2013, and on February 5,
2013, the jury found that we infringed certain claims of the subject patents. The jury awarded $70.0 million in monetary damages for lost profits. The jury also found that we willfully infringed the subject patents. We filed multiple post-trial
motions, including a motion seeking a new trial. On August 7, 2013, the trial court issued a ruling denying all of our motions and awarded treble damages and attorneys’ fees to Stryker. We filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit to seek reversal of both the jury’s verdict and the trial court’s rulings on our post-trial motions. That appeal is pending. We have not accrued an estimated loss related to this matter in our consolidated statement
of earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 or any prior period because we do not believe that it is probable that we have incurred a liability. Although we believe we have strong grounds to reverse the trial court’s judgment, the
ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain. In the future we could be required to record a charge of up to $210.0 million plus interest and

attorneys’ fees that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Regulatory Matters

In September 2012, we received a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) citing concerns relating to certain manufacturing and validation processes pertaining to

Trilogy

®

Acetabular System products manufactured at our Ponce, Puerto Rico manufacturing facility. We have provided detailed responses to the FDA as to our corrective
actions and will continue to work expeditiously to address the issues identified by the FDA during inspections in Ponce. As of December 31, 2013, the warning letter remains pending. Until the violations are corrected, we may be subject to
additional regulatory action by the FDA, including seizure, injunction and/or civil monetary penalties. Additionally, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments related to products manufactured at the Ponce facility may not be granted and
premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the quality system regulation deviations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. In addition to responding to the warning letter described
above, we are in the process of addressing various FDA Form 483 inspectional observations at certain of our manufacturing facilities. The ultimate outcome of these matters is presently uncertain.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.

During 2013, we transitioned work to a third-party
service provider to outsource certain finance functions that

historically had been performed in multiple countries throughout Europe and in the U.S. We also centralized other finance functions that historically had been performed in a decentralized manner.
This outsourcing and centralization are part of our ongoing operational excellence initiatives.

Also in 2013, we implemented
and began to use new software to consolidate our worldwide financial information. This software implementation is part of our operational excellence initiatives in order to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our financial reporting
process.

In connection with the outsourcing, centralization of finance functions, and software implementation and the
resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control processes to ensure suitable controls over our financial reporting. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting appears in this report at the conclusion of Part II, Item 7A.
