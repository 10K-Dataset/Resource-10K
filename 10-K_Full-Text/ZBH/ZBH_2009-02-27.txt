ANNUAL REPORT

PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

OVERVIEW

We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture
    and marketing of orthopaedic and dental reconstructive implants,
    spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical products.
    We also provide other healthcare related services. In this
    report, “Zimmer,” “we,” “us,”
    “our,” and similar words refer collectively to Zimmer
    Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to
    the parent company only.

There were several developments in 2008 that had a significant
    impact on our business.

We continued to meet our obligations under the Deferred
    Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) and the Corporate
    Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) we signed in September
    2007. During 2008, we devoted substantial resources to meet our
    obligations under those agreements and implemented enhancements
    to our corporate compliance program applicable in most respects
    to all of our businesses on a global basis.

In the first half of 2008, we initiated voluntary product
    recalls of certain Orthopaedic Surgical Products
    (“OSP”) manufactured at our Dover, Ohio facility that
    we determined did not meet internal quality standards.
    Additionally, we voluntarily and temporarily suspended
    production and sales of certain OSP products manufactured at the
    Dover facility. We expect to have a significant portion of these
    products back into production by the end of the first quarter of
    2009, with most other products coming back into production in
    the second quarter of 2009.

In July 2008, we suspended marketing and distribution of the

Durom

®

Acetabular Component (

Durom

Cup) in the U.S. to
    permit us to update product labeling and implement a surgical
    training program in the U.S. We resumed marketing and
    distribution of the

Durom

Cup in the U.S. in August
    2008. We received claims from a number of

Durom

Cup
    patients seeking reimbursement for costs and payments for
    alleged pain and suffering and we recorded a provision for
    certain claims of $69.0 million in 2008, which represents
    management’s estimate of liability to patients undergoing
    revision surgeries related to the

Durom

Cup. In addition,
    we expect that our entry into the U.S. hip resurfacing
    market may be hindered or delayed as the

Durom

Cup has
    been integral to our plans for entry into that market.

In October 2008, we acquired Abbott Spine, previously a
    subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for approximately
    $360 million. This investment adds a number of innovative
    products and helps build toward critical mass in the Spine
    product category. The acquisition also enhances our research and
    development capabilities in the Spine product category and
    strengthens our sales coverage.

Zimmer Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in
    2001.  Our history dates to 1927, when Zimmer
    Manufacturing Company, a predecessor, was founded in Warsaw, I
    ndiana. On August 6, 2001, Zimmer Holdings was spun off
    from its former parent and became an independent public company.

CUSTOMERS, SALES
    AND MARKETING

Our primary customers include musculoskeletal surgeons,
    neurosurgeons, oral surgeons, dentists, hospitals, stocking
    distributors, healthcare dealers and, in their capacity as
    agents, healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups.
    These customers range from large multinational enterprises to
    independent surgeons.

We have operations in more than 25 countries and market products
    in more than 100 countries, with corporate headquarters in
    Warsaw, Indiana, and more than 100 manufacturing,
    distribution and warehousing

and/or

office facilities worldwide. We manage our operations through
    three major geographic segments – the Americas, which
    is comprised principally of the United States and includes other
    North, Central and South American markets; Europe, which is
    comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and
    Africa; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan
    and includes other Asian and Pacific markets.

We market and sell products through three principal channels:
    1) direct to healthcare institutions, such as hospitals or
    direct channel accounts, 2) through stocking distributors
    and, in the Asia Pacific region, healthcare dealers, and
    3) directly to dental practices and dental laboratories.
    With direct channel accounts, inventory is generally consigned
    to sales agents or customers. With sales to stocking
    distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices and dental
    laboratories, title to product passes generally upon shipment.
    Direct channel accounts represented approximately
    80 percent of our net sales in 2008. No individual direct
    channel account, stocking distributor, healthcare dealer, dental
    practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than
    1 percent of our net sales for 2008.

We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title
    to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products
    are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock
    levels are determined based on a number of factors, including
    demand, manufacturing lead times and quantities required to
    maintain service levels. We also carry trade accounts receivable
    balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent
    with local market practices.

We utilize a network of sales associates, sales managers and
    support personnel, most of whom are employed or contracted by
    independent distributors and sales agencies. We invest a
    significant amount of time and expense in training sales
    associates in how to use specific products and how to best
    inform surgeons of product features and uses. Sales force
    representatives must have strong technical selling skills and
    medical education to provide technical support for surgeons.

In response to the different healthcare systems throughout the
    world, our sales and marketing strategies and



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

organizational structures differ by region. We utilize a global
    approach to sales force training, marketing and medical
    education to provide consistent, high quality service.
    Additionally, we keep current with key surgical developments and
    other issues related to musculoskeletal surgeons, neurosurgeons,
    dentists and oral surgeons and the medical procedures they
    perform.

Americas.

The Americas is our largest
    geographic segment, accounting for $2,353.9 million, or
    57 percent, of 2008 net sales, with the United States
    accounting for 94 percent of net sales in this region. The
    United States sales force primarily consists of independent
    sales agents, most of whom sell products exclusively for Zimmer.
    Sales agents in the United States receive a commission on
    product sales and are responsible for many operating decisions
    and costs. Sales commissions are accrued at the time of sale.

In this region, we contract with group purchasing organizations
    and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by
    offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions
    within a specified group. Generally, we are designated as one of
    several preferred purchasing sources for specified products,
    although members are not obligated to purchase our products.
    Contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a
    term of three years with extensions as warranted.

A majority of hospitals in the United States belong to at least
    one group purchasing organization. In 2008, individual hospital
    orders purchased through contractual arrangements with our two
    largest group purchasing organizations accounted for
    approximately 35 percent of our net sales in the United
    States. Contractual sales were highest through Novation, LLC and
    Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P. No individual end-user,
    however, accounted for over 1 percent of our net sales, and
    the top ten end-users accounted for approximately 4 percent
    of our aggregate net sales in the United States.

In the Americas, we monitor and rank independent sales agents
    across a range of performance metrics including the achievement
    of certain sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of
    working capital.

Europe.

The European geographic segment
    accounted for $1,179.1 million, or 29 percent, of
    2008 net sales, with France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
    Switzerland and the United Kingdom collectively accounting for
    over 75 percent of net sales in the region. This segment
    also includes other key markets, including Benelux, Nordic,
    Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our
    sales force in this region is comprised of direct sales
    associates, commissioned agents, independent distributors and
    sales support personnel. In Europe, we emphasize the advantages
    of our clinically proven, established designs and innovative
    solutions, such as minimally invasive surgical procedures and
    technologies and new and enhanced materials and surfaces.

Asia Pacific.

The Asia Pacific geographic
    segment accounted for $588.1 million, or 14 percent,
    of 2008 net sales, with Japan being the largest market
    within this segment, accounting for approximately
    55 percent of the region’s sales. This segment also
    includes key markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Korea,
    China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and
    Malaysia. In Japan and most countries in the Asia Pacific
    region, we maintain a network of dealers, who act as order
    agents on behalf of hospitals in the region, and sales
    associates, who build and maintain relationships with
    musculoskeletal surgeons, neurosurgeons and dental surgeons in
    their markets. These sales associates cover over 7,000 hospitals
    in the region. The knowledge and skills of our sales associates
    play a critical role in providing service, product information
    and support to surgeons.

SEASONALITY

Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, as many of our
    products are used in elective procedures, which typically
    decline during the summer months and holiday seasons.

DISTRIBUTION

We operate distribution facilities domestically in Warsaw,
    Indiana; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina; Memphis,
    Tennessee; Carlsbad, California; Austin, Texas and
    internationally, in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China,
    Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea,
    the Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden,
    Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom. We
    generally ship our orders via expedited courier. Our operations
    support local language labeling requirements for the European
    Union member countries, as well as specific Asia Pacific
    countries. Our backlog of firm orders is not considered material
    to an understanding of our business.

PRODUCTS

Our products include orthopaedic and dental reconstructive
    implants, spinal implants, trauma products, and related surgical
    products. Orthopaedic reconstructive implants restore joint
    function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees,
    hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants
    restore function and aesthetics in patients who have lost teeth
    due to trauma or disease. Orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons
    use spinal implants in the treatment of degenerative diseases,
    deformities and trauma. Trauma products are used primarily to
    reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the
    body’s natural healing process. Our related surgical
    products include supplies and instruments designed to aid in
    orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation
    rehabilitation.

We utilize our exclusive

Trabecular
    Metal

tm

Technology across various product categories.

Trabecular
    Metal

material is a structural biomaterial whose cellular
    architecture resembles bone and approximates its physical and
    mechanical properties more closely than other prosthetic
    materials. The highly porous trabecular configuration is
    conducive to more normal bone formation and bone in-growth.

Trabecular Metal

implants are fabricated using elemental
    tantalum metal and a patented vapor deposition technique that
    creates a metallic strut configuration resembling cancellous
    bone with nano-textured surface features.

Orthopaedic
    Reconstructive Implants

Knee
    Implants

Total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral
    component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an articular
    surface (placed on the tibial tray). Knee replacement surgeries
    include first-time, or primary, joint replacement procedures and
    revision procedures for the replacement, repair or enhancement
    of an implant or component from a previous procedure. Knee
    implants are designed to accommodate different levels of
    ligament stabilization of the joint. While some knee implant
    designs, called cruciate retaining (CR) designs, require the
    retention of the posterior cruciate ligament, other designs,
    called posterior stabilized (PS) and ultracongruent (UC)
    designs, provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate
    ligament. There are also procedures for partial reconstruction
    of the knee, which treat limited knee degeneration and involve
    the replacement of only one side, or compartment, of the knee
    with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis.

Our portfolio of

Minimally Invasive
    Solutions

tm

Procedures (“MIS”) includes the MIS Mini-Incision
    Total Knee Procedure. The MIS Mini-Incision Total Knee
    Instruments feature smaller instruments which accommodate a
    smaller incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft
    tissues.

We offer a wide range of products for specialized knee
    procedures, including the following:

NexGen

®

Complete Knee Solution.  The

NexGen

Knee
    product line is a comprehensive system for knee replacement
    surgery which has had significant application in PS, CR and
    revision procedures. The

    provides surgeons with complete and versatile knee instrument
    options, including MIS Mini-Incision Instruments, milling and
    multiple traditional saw blade cutting instrument systems. The
    breadth and versatility of the

NexGen

Knee System allows
    surgeons to change from one type of implant to another during
    surgery, according to the needs of the patient, and to support
    current surgical philosophies.

The

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution

Legacy

®

Knee-Posterior

Stabilized product line provides stability in the absence of the
    posterior cruciate ligament. The PS capabilities were augmented
    through the introduction of the

NexGen Legacy

Posterior
    Stabilized Flex Knee (the “LPS-Flex Knee”), a
    high-flexion implant that has the potential to accommodate knee
    flexion up to a

155-degree

range of motion in some patients. In late 2007, the Premarket
    Approval (PMA) application for the

NexGen

LPS-Flex Mobile
    Knee was approved by the FDA. With the staged rollout of this
    product in the U.S., we are now one of only two companies that
    can offer a mobile-bearing total knee treatment option in the
    U.S.

The

NexGen

CR product line is designed to be used in
    conjunction with a functioning posterior cruciate ligament. The

NexGen

CR-Flex Fixed Bearing Knee is designed with
    components to provide a greater range of motion for patients who
    require deep bending in their daily activities. The

    2008 and incorporates key gender specific design features and a
    proprietary guided milling surgical technique for use in
    patello-femoral joint replacement.

Hip
    Implants

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the
    femur and the socket portion of the pelvis (acetabulum) of the
    natural hip. Hip procedures include first time, or primary,
    joint replacement as well as revision procedures. Approximately
    30 percent of hip implant procedures involve the use of
    bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the
    surrounding bone. The remaining are press-fit into bone, which
    means that they have a surface that bone affixes to through
    either ongrowth or ingrowth technologies.

Our portfolio of MIS Techniques includes the

Zimmer

MIS
    Anterior Supine Technique, the MIS Posterior Procedure, the

Zimmer

MIS Anterolateral Technique and
    MIS

2-Incision

tm

Hip Replacement Procedure. The MIS Techniques are designed to be
    less invasive to soft tissues and to shorten recovery time.

Our key hip replacement products include:

Zimmer

M/L Taper Hip Prosthesis with

Kinectiv

®

Technology.  The

Zimmer

M/L Taper Hip
    Prosthesis offers a proximally porous-coated wedge-shaped design
    based on long term clinically proven concepts. The M/L Taper has
    become widely used in MIS Procedures due to several key design
    features. The

Zimmer

M/L Taper Hip Prosthesis with

Kinectiv

Technology is a system of modular stem and neck
    components designed to help the surgeon restore the natural hip
    joint center intraoperatively by addressing the key variables of

Trauma products include devices used to stabilize damaged or
    broken bones and their surrounding tissues to support the
    body’s natural healing processes. Fractures are most often
    stabilized using internal fixation devices such as plates,
    screws, nails, wires and pins, but may also be stabilized using
    external fixation devices which are applied externally to the
    limb. We are focused on addressing unmet clinical needs,
    aligning our trauma products with MIS Procedures and integrating

ORTHOBIOLOGICS

Our research and development efforts include an Orthobiologics
    group based in Austin, Texas, with its own full-time staff and
    dedicated projects centralizing on the development of biologic
    technologies for musculoskeletal applications, including the
    repair and replacement of damaged tendon, ligament, meniscus,
    articular cartilage, bone and spinal nucleus tissues. This group
    works on biological solutions to repair and regenerate damaged
    or degenerated musculoskeletal tissues using biomaterials/cell
    therapies which offer the possibility of treating damaged joints
    by biological repair rather than replacing them. A sampling of
    some of our key projects in the Orthobiologics area is set forth
    below.

We are collaborating with ISTO Technologies, Inc. (ISTO) to
    develop chondral (Neocartilage) and osteochondral grafts

for cartilage repair. ISTO creates cell-based therapies for
    cartilage regeneration using cells from juvenile donor
    cartilage. Neocartilage is a living tissue-engineered cartilage
    graft under clinical investigation for the restoration of
    cartilage defects, reestablishment of joint function and relief
    of pain in the knee. The Phase I/II clinical trial (IND) for
    Neocartilage has completed patient enrollment with all patients
    having reached the

12-month

follow-up

milestone. We plan to distribute this product as

DeNovo

®

ET Engineered Tissue Graft. In addition, we launched our first
    cartilage repair product (

DeNovo

NT Natural Tissue Graft)
    in 2007 and expanded use of the product in 2008. This product
    provides particulated juvenile cartilage tissue for repair of
    articular cartilage defects and has been implanted in nearly
    200 patients during this limited release phase.

Many musculoskeletal surgical procedures use bone grafts to help
    regenerate lost or damaged bone. In 2008, our Spine, Dental and
    Trauma divisions introduced a technologically advanced all-human
    demineralized bone matrix,

Puros

DBM Putty and Putty with
    bone chips. This bone-derived allograft material is used to fill
    bone voids or defects. It is placed into the bone void where it
    is then completely replaced by natural bone during the healing
    process.

RESEARCH AND
    DEVELOPMENT

We have extensive research and development activities to develop
    new surgical techniques, materials, orthobiologics and product
    designs. The research and development functions work closely
    with our strategic brand marketing function. The rapid
    commercialization of innovative new materials, orthobiologics
    products, implant and instrument designs, and surgical
    techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to
    be an important driver of sales growth.

We are broadening our product offerings in each of the product
    categories and exploring new technologies with possible
    applications in multiple areas. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we spent
    $194.0 million, $209.6 million, and
    $188.3 million, respectively, on research and development.
    The decreased spending on research and development in 2008
    reflects delays connected with our operational compliance with
    the DPA and CIA and implementation of our enhanced compliance
    and ethics initiatives. We intend to increase spending on
    product development in 2009. Our primary research and
    development facility is located in Warsaw, Indiana. We have
    other research and development personnel based in, among other
    places, Winterthur, Switzerland; Austin, Texas; Minneapolis,
    Minnesota; Carlsbad, California; Dover, Ohio; and Parsippany,
    New Jersey. As of December 31, 2008, we employed more than
    800 research and development employees worldwide.

We expect to continue to identify innovative technologies and
    consider acquiring complementary products or businesses, or
    establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic
    alliances.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE

We are subject to government regulation in the countries in
    which we conduct business. In the U.S., numerous laws and
    regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices
    are brought to market. These include, among others, the Federal
    Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations issued or
    promulgated thereunder. The U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) has enacted regulations that control all
    aspects of the development, manufacture, advertising, promotion
    and postmarket surveillance of medical products, including
    medical devices. In addition, the FDA controls the access of
    products to market through processes designed to ensure that
    only products that are safe and effective are made available to
    the public.

Most of our new products fall into FDA classifications that
    require the submission of a Premarket Notification (510(k)) to
    the FDA. This process requires us to demonstrate that the device
    to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is,
    substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device. We must
    submit information that supports our substantial equivalency
    claims. Before we can market the new device, we must receive an
    order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence and clearing
    the new device for commercial distribution in the United States.
    Other devices we develop and market are in a category (class)
    for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical
    investigation and Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. The PMA
    process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that
    establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective.
    The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution
    if it determines that the data and information in the PMA
    constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is
    reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for
    its intended use(s). All of our devices marketed in the
    United States have been cleared or approved by the FDA,
    with the exception of certain

pre-amendment

devices which were in commercial distribution prior to
    May 28, 1976. The FDA has grandfathered these devices, so
    new FDA submissions are not required. Some low risk medical
    devices (including most instruments) also do not require FDA
    review and approval or clearance prior to commercial
    distribution. The FDA has the authority to: halt the
    distribution of certain medical devices; detain or seize
    adulterated or misbranded medical devices; or order the repair,
    replacement of or refund the costs of such devices. There are
    also certain requirements of state, local and foreign
    governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and
    marketing of our products.

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our
    products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among
    other things, design and product standards, packaging
    requirements and labeling requirements. Many of the regulations
    applicable to our devices and products in these countries are
    similar to those of the FDA. The member countries of the
    European Union have adopted the European Medical Device
    Directive, which creates a single set of medical device
    regulations for products marketed in all member countries.
    Compliance with the Medical Device



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

Directive and certification to a quality system enable the
    manufacturer to place a CE mark on its products. To obtain
    authorization to affix the CE mark to a product, a recognized
    European Notified Body must assess a manufacturer’s quality
    systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of
    the Medical Device Directive. We are subject to inspection by
    the Notified Bodies for compliance with these requirements.

Further, we are subject to various federal and state laws
    concerning healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims
    laws and anti-kickback laws. These laws are administered by,
    among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of
    Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
    and state attorneys general. Many of these agencies have
    increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical
    device manufacturers in recent years. Violations of these laws
    are punishable by criminal

and/or

civil
    sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment
    and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in
    government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and
    Veterans Administration (VA) health programs. As part of meeting
    our obligations under the 2007 DPA, we developed and have
    substantially implemented enhanced compliance initiatives and
    are applying these enhancements in most respects to all of our
    businesses on a global basis.

Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex
    federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational
    safety laws and regulations, including those relating to
    discharges of substances in the air, water and land, the
    handling, storage and disposal of wastes and the

clean-up

of
    properties by pollutants. We do not expect that the ongoing
    costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will
    have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital
    expenditures or competitive position.

COMPETITION

The orthopaedics industry is highly competitive. In the global
    markets for reconstructive implants, trauma and related surgical
    products, our major competitors include: DePuy Orthopaedics,
    Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Stryker
    Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Synthes, Inc., Smith &
    Nephew plc, Wright Medical Group, Inc. and Tornier Inc.

In the Americas geographic segment, we and DePuy Orthopaedics,
    Inc., Stryker Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Smith &
    Nephew, Inc. (a subsidiary of Smith & Nephew plc),
    Wright Medical Group, Inc. and Synthes, Inc. account for a large
    majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales.

In the Asia Pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma
    products, we compete primarily with DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.,
    Stryker Corporation, Synthes, Inc. and Smith & Nephew
    plc, as well as regional companies, including Japan Medical
    Materials Corporation and Japan Medical Dynamic Marketing, Inc.
    Factors, such as the dealer system, complex regulatory
    environments and the accompanying inability to compete on price,
    make it difficult for smaller companies, particularly those that
    are non-regional, to compete effectively with the market leaders
    in the Asia Pacific region.

The European reconstructive implant and trauma product markets
    are more fragmented than the Americas or the Asia Pacific
    segments. The variety of philosophies held by European surgeons
    regarding hip reconstruction, for example, has fostered the
    existence of many regional European companies, including Mathys
    AG and Waldemar LINK GmbH & Co. KG, which, in addition
    to the global competitors, compete with us. Today most hip
    implants sold in Europe are products developed specifically for
    the European market, although global products are gaining
    acceptance. We will continue to develop and produce specially
    tailored products to meet specific European needs.

In the spinal implant category, we compete globally primarily
    with Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic,
    Inc.), DePuy Spine (a subsidiary of Johnson &
    Johnson), Synthes, Inc., Stryker Corporation and EBI, L.P., now
    operating as Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine (a subsidiary of
    Biomet, Inc.).

In the dental reconstructive implant category, we compete
    primarily with Nobel Biocare Holding AG, Straumann Holding AG
    and Implant Innovations, Inc. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.).

Competition within the industry is primarily based on
    technology, innovation, quality, reputation and customer
    service. A key factor in our continuing success in the future
    will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing
    products and technologies.

MANUFACTURING AND
    RAW MATERIALS

We manufacture substantially all of our products at eight sites
    including Warsaw, Indiana; Winterthur, Switzerland; Ponce,
    Puerto Rico; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina; Carlsbad,
    California; Parsippany, New Jersey; and Etupes, France. In
    February 2008, we announced plans to open a new manufacturing
    facility in Shannon, Ireland and are scheduled to open the
    facility in the second half of 2009.

We believe that our manufacturing facilities set industry
    standards in terms of automation and productivity and have the
    flexibility to accommodate future growth. The manufacturing
    operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the
    cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a
    manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous operational
    improvement and optimization. In addition, at certain of our
    manufacturing facilities, many of the employees are
    cross-trained to perform a broad array of operations.

We generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at
    levels up to 90 percent of total capacity. We continually
    evaluate the potential to in-source products currently purchased
    from outside vendors to

on-site

production.

We have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our
    profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs. We
    have, for example, employed computer-assisted robots and
    multi-axis grinders to precision polish medical devices;
    automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes,
    including on-machine inspection and process controls; purchased
    state-of-the-art equipment; in-sourced

ANNUAL REPORT

core products, such as castings and forgings; and negotiated
    reductions in third party supplier costs.

We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the
    manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw
    materials and select components used in manufacturing our
    products from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase some
    supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance,
    sole source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints
    resulting from regulatory requirements. We work closely with our
    suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high
    quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any
    significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials
    necessary to fulfill our production schedules.

INTELLECTUAL
    PROPERTY

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the
    continued success of our business. We also rely upon trade
    secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and
    licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive
    position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of
    methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary
    information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and
    others who may have access to proprietary information. We own or
    control through licensing arrangements more than 4,000 issued
    patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate
    to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our
    products.

EMPLOYEES

We employ more than 8,500 employees worldwide, including
    more than 800 employees dedicated to research and
    development. Over 5,200 employees are located within the
    United States and approximately 3,300 employees are located
    outside of the United States, primarily throughout Europe and in
    Japan. We have over 3,600 employees dedicated to
    manufacturing our products worldwide. The Warsaw, Indiana
    production facility employs more than 1,600 employees.
    Fewer than 200 North American employees are members of a trade
    union covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

In May 2007, we renewed a collective bargaining agreement with
    the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber Manufacturing,
    Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International
    Union for and on behalf of Local

2737-15

covering employees at the Dover, Ohio facility, which continues
    in effect until May 15, 2012.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from
    our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial
    condition and results of operations are discussed below and
    elsewhere in this report. The risks and uncertainties described
    below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently
    not believed to be significant to our business may also affect
    our actual results and could harm our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or
    uncertainties described below or any additional risks and
    uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of
    operations and financial condition could be materially and
    adversely affected.

RISKS RELATED TO
    OUR BUSINESS

If we fail to comply with the terms of the Deferred
    Prosecution Agreement and Corporate Integrity Agreement we
    entered into in September 2007, we may be subject to criminal
    prosecution

and/or

exclusion from federal healthcare programs.

As previously reported, in September 2007 we settled an
    investigation conducted by the United States Attorney’s
    Office for the District of New Jersey (the
    “U.S. Attorney”) into financial relationships
    between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting
    orthopaedic surgeons. As part of that settlement, we entered
    into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the “DPA”) with
    the U.S. Attorney and a Corporate Integrity Agreement (the
    “CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General of the
    Department of Health and Human Services (the
    “OIG-HHS”). Copies of the DPA and CIA are filed as
    exhibits to this report and a copy of the DPA is available on
    our website at www.zimmer.com.



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

If we do not comply with the terms of these agreements, we could
    be subject to prosecution for violations of the federal
    Anti-Kickback Statute that the U.S. Attorney alleges we
    committed between 2002 and 2006, as well as any new or
    continuing violations. We could also be subject to exclusion by
    OIG-HHS from participation in federal healthcare programs,
    including Medicaid and Medicare.

We could be subject to further governmental investigations or
    actions by other third parties based on allegations of
    wrongdoing similar to those made by the U.S. Attorney.

Our settlement with the U.S. government does not preclude
    other governmental agencies or state authorities from conducting
    investigations or instituting proceedings based on allegations
    of wrongdoing similar to those made by the U.S. Attorney.
    As previously disclosed, we are cooperating with the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the
    U.S. Department of Justice with regard to an informal
    investigation into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act in the sale of medical devices in a number of
    foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry.
    We are also cooperating with investigative demands made by two
    state attorneys general. While we believe that the pending state
    investigations are not likely to have a material adverse effect
    on our business or financial condition, similar investigations
    by other states or governmental agencies are possible. In
    addition, the settlement with the government could increase our
    exposure to lawsuits by potential whistleblowers under the
    federal false claims acts, based on new theories or allegations
    arising from the allegations made by the U.S. Attorney. We
    intend to review and take appropriate actions with respect to
    any such investigations or proceedings; however, we cannot
    assure that the costs of defending or resolving those
    investigations or proceedings would not have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows.

If we are not able to fulfill or otherwise resolve our
    existing royalty and other payment obligations to healthcare
    professional consultants and institutions, our ability to
    maintain our existing intellectual property rights and obtain
    future rights may be impaired.

We have reviewed our existing royalty agreements with healthcare
    professional consultants and institutions in light of the
    requirements of the DPA. Following our review, we resumed paying
    royalties with respect to some of the agreements. With respect
    to others, we made lump-sum payments to resolve our accrued and
    future royalty obligations and secure rights to the intellectual
    property. With respect to the remaining agreements, if we do not
    fulfill our obligations or reach some other resolution
    acceptable to the affected healthcare professional consultants
    and institutions, our ability to use the intellectual property
    covered by those agreements may be adversely affected. In
    addition, our ability to enter into new agreements with
    healthcare professional consultants or institutions for the
    future acquisition of intellectual property rights may be
    adversely affected.

Our temporary suspension of the U.S. marketing and
    distribution of one of our hip products has adversely affected
    sales, resulted in claims and may adversely affect our ability
    to compete in the growing hip resurfacing market in the U.S.

In July 2008, we temporarily suspended the marketing and
    distribution of our

Durom

Acetabular Component (

Durom

Cup) in the U.S. We believe this action adversely
    affected our hip product sales in the U.S. in the last half
    of 2008. Although we resumed U.S. marketing and
    distribution in August 2008, we expect the effects of this
    action will continue to have a negative impact through 2009.

Following our action, product liability lawsuits and other
    claims were asserted against us and we expect additional similar
    claims will be asserted. In addition, we expect that our entry
    into the growing U.S. hip resurfacing market has been
    delayed as the

Durom

Cup had been integral to our plans
    for entry into that market.

The implementation of our enhanced global compliance program
    is requiring us to devote substantial resources, is disruptive
    to normal business activities and may place us at a competitive
    disadvantage.

Since entering into the DPA and CIA, we have devoted substantial
    resources to meet our obligations under those agreements and
    implemented enhancements to our global compliance program
    applicable in most respects to all of our businesses on a global
    basis. These efforts have not only involved significant expense,
    but also required management and other key employees to focus
    extensively on these matters, preventing them from devoting as
    much time as they otherwise would to other business matters. If
    our competitors do not make similar enhancements to their
    compliance programs, this may place us at a competitive
    disadvantage and adversely affect our results of operations.

We believe we have lost market share as a result of recent
    events. If we are not able to recover or grow our market share,
    our operating results could be materially adversely affected.

We believe that the disruptive effects of the product
    suspensions and recalls in 2008 and the implementation of our
    enhanced global compliance initiatives contributed to customer
    losses during the last half of 2008. We may not be able to
    recapture market share lost due to these events and we may
    continue to lose customers due to these factors in the future.

If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors
    upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may
    not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may
    decline.

Our marketing success in the United States and abroad depends
    significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales
    and service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents
    have developed professional relationships with existing and
    potential customers because of the agents’ detailed
    knowledge of products and instruments. A loss of a significant
    number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on
    our business and results of operations.

ANNUAL REPORT

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our
    products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy
    our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we
    may not anticipate because of:

•

evolving customer needs;

•

changing demographics;

•

slowing industry growth rates;

•

declines in the reconstructive implant market;

•

the introduction of new products and technologies;

•

evolving surgical philosophies; and

•

evolving industry standards.

Without the timely introduction of new products and
    enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If
    that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer.
    The success of our new product offerings will depend on several
    factors, including our ability to:

•

properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

•

commercialize new products in a timely manner;

•

manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient
    volumes on time;

•

differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings;

•

achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

•

satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers
    and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative
    recovery and lower-cost procedures;

•

innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical
    techniques; and

•

provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical
    techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some
    or all markets, because of, among other factors:

•

entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

•

the need for regulatory clearance; and

•

uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment
    in research and development before we can determine their
    commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources
    necessary to fund the production. In addition, even if we are
    able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of
    our products, these enhancements or new generations of products
    may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development
    and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer
    preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products
    embodying new technologies or features.

We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside
    of the United States, which subjects us to additional business
    risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to
    increased costs.

We sell our products in more than 100 countries and derive more
    than 40% of our net sales from outside the United States.
    We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales
    internationally, which could expose us to additional risks
    associated with international sales and operations. Our
    international operations are, and will continue to be, subject
    to a number of risks and potential costs, including:

•

changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

•

unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;

•

differing local product preferences and product requirements;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries
    outside of the United States;

•

trade protection measures and import or export requirements that
    may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and
    may increase our operating costs;

•

foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from
    repatriating cash earned in countries outside the
    United States;

•

complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

•

extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

labor force instability;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax
    laws; and

•

political and economic instability.

Violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines,
    criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees,
    prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our
    reputation.

We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate
    fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our
    profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.

A substantial portion of our foreign revenues are generated in
    Europe and Japan. The United States dollar value of our
    foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate
    fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the United
    States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese Yen, as well
    as other currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations. Although we address currency risk
    management through regular operating and financing activities,
    and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial
    instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.
    The current global economic crisis has generally increased the
    risk of entering into derivative financial instruments, even if
    major international financial institutions act as counterparties.

We may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology
    and other intellectual property, which would allow competitors
    or others to take advantage of our research and development
    efforts.

Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market
    technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or
    maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not
    be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary
    technologies. Also, our currently pending or future patent
    applications may not result in issued patents, and issued
    patents are subject to claims concerning priority, scope and
    other issues.



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

The United States Patent and Trademark Office and the courts
    have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or
    interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and
    biotechnology patents. Future changes in, or unexpected
    interpretations of, the patent laws may adversely affect our
    ability to enforce our patent position.

In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or
    of limited effect in some foreign countries. If we do not obtain
    sufficient international protection for our intellectual
    property, our competitiveness in international markets could be
    impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue.

We also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary
    know-how and continuing technological innovation with security
    measures, including the use of confidentiality agreements with
    our employees, consultants, and collaborators. These measures
    may prove to be ineffective and any remedies available to us may
    be insufficient to compensate our damages.

We may be subject to intellectual property litigation and
    infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant
    expenses or prevent us from selling our products.

A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property
    infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and
    profitability, in some cases materially. From time to time, we
    receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and
    receive claims of potential infringement. We may be unaware of
    intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of
    our technology. If someone claims that our products infringed
    their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation
    could be costly and time consuming and would divert the
    attention of management and key personnel from other business
    issues. If we were to lose such litigation involving material
    intellectual property rights, we may be unable to manufacture,
    sell or use some of our products.

We may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic
    alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be
    disruptive.

We intend to continue to look for additional strategic
    acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our
    businesses and other companies with whom we could form strategic
    alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit
    intellectual property rights. These activities involve risks,
    including the following:

•

we may need to divert more management resources to integration
    than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to
    pursue other more profitable activities;

•

the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses may be
    increased if we need to integrate geographically separated
    organizations, personnel with disparate business backgrounds and
    companies with different corporate cultures;

•

we may not recognize expected cost savings from acquisitions or
    the anticipated benefits of strategic alliances;

•

our acquisition candidates or strategic partners may have
    unexpected liabilities or prove unable to meet their obligations
    to us or the joint venture; and

•

the priorities of our strategic partners may prove incompatible
    with ours.

We depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw
    materials and outsourced activities.

We use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to
    manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing
    activities. These suppliers must provide the materials and
    perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our
    quality and regulatory requirements. Some key raw materials and
    outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source
    or a limited number of sources. A prolonged disruption or other
    inability to obtain these materials or outsource key
    manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect
    our ability to satisfy demand for our products.

We are subject to putative stockholder class action lawsuits
    that could be costly to defend and distracting to management.

We and a number of our related parties are defending putative
    stockholder class action lawsuits alleging violations of the
    securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duties or violations of
    the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    arising out of trading or ownership of our common stock. We
    believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we intend to
    defend them vigorously. We may incur significant expenses
    associated with the defense of these lawsuits, however, and the
    necessary participation of our executive officers could detract
    from their ability to devote their full time and attention to
    our business operations.

RISKS RELATED TO
    OUR INDUSTRY

The ongoing informal investigation by the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding potential
    violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the sale of
    medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in
    the medical device industry could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition and cash flows.

We are cooperating fully with the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice with
    regard to an ongoing informal investigation of potential
    violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the sale of
    medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in
    the medical device industry. Although we have adopted policies
    and procedures designed to prevent improper payments and we
    train our employees, distributors and others concerning these
    issues, we cannot assure that violations of these requirements
    will not occur. If we are found to have violated the Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act, we may face sanctions including fines,
    criminal penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or
    debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies
    or receive export licenses.

We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on
    an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business
    practices and restrict our operations in the future.

Our industry is subject to various federal and state laws
    pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims

    sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment
    and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in
    government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and
    Veterans Administration (VA) health programs. The interpretation
    and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and
    subject to rapid change.

If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for
    our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our
    products may decline and our ability to sell our products
    profitably may be harmed.

We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors,
    dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which receive
    reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their
    patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and
    international government programs, private insurance plans and
    managed care programs. These third-party payors may deny
    reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a
    procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment
    methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for
    an unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline to
    reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. If our
    products are not considered cost-effective by third-party
    payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for our products.

In addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to
    contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level
    of reimbursement for medical products and services. If
    third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and
    other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our
    products may decline or we may experience pressure to reduce the
    prices of our products, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our sales and results of operations.

We have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing
    and other effects of healthcare reform in our international
    markets. If key participants in government healthcare systems
    reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and
    results of operations may be adversely affected.

The ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing
    organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations.

Many customers for our products have formed group purchasing
    organizations in an effort to contain costs. Group purchasing
    organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply
    manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are
    made available to a group purchasing organization’s
    affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the
    providers selected by a group purchasing organization,
    affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to
    purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization
    has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another
    manufacturer’s products, we may be precluded from making
    sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the
    duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to respond
    to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing
    organizations may cause us to lose market share to our
    competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our
    sales and results of operations.

Continuing weakness in the global economy is likely to
    adversely affect our business until an economic recovery is
    underway.

A significant portion of our products are used in procedures
    covered by private insurance, many of which, including
    procedures using our dental products, may be considered elective
    procedures. We expect the current global economic crisis is
    likely to reduce the availability or affordability of private
    insurance or may impact patient decisions to have an elective
    procedure performed. If current economic conditions continue or
    worsen, we expect that increasing levels of unemployment and
    pressures to contain healthcare costs could adversely affect the
    global growth rate of hip and knee procedure volume, which could
    have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of
    operations.

Our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and
    market our products against those of our competitors.

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our present or
    future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by
    technological advances by one or more of our present or future
    competitors or by other therapies, including orthobiological
    therapies. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop
    and acquire new products and technologies. Competition is
    primarily on the basis of:

•

technology;

•

innovation;

•

quality;

•

reputation; and

•

customer service.

In markets outside of the United States, other factors influence
    competition as well, including:

•

local distribution systems;

•

complex regulatory environments; and

•

differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

Our competitors may:

•

have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

•

respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

•

undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

•

adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

•

be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees
    and strategic partners.

Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to
    have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.

FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

We and our customers are subject to various governmental
    regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and
    marketing of our products and we may incur significant expenses
    to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible
    with these regulations.

The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market
    are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other
    federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process
    of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can
    be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted
    for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in
    receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products
    could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in
    substantial additional costs.

In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable material
    regulatory requirements, including, for example, the Quality
    System Regulation, recordkeeping regulations, labeling
    requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, we may be
    subject to a range of sanctions including:

•

warning letters;

•

fines or civil penalties;

•

injunctions;

•

repairs, replacements or refunds;

•

recalls or seizures of products;

•

total or partial suspension of production;

•

the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or
    approvals;

•

withdrawals or suspensions of current product
    applications; and

•

criminal prosecution.

Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules
    of industrial standards bodies, such as the International
    Standards Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of
    these regulations, our business will be harmed.

We may incur product liability losses, and insurance coverage
    may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.

In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of
    product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures,
    manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of
    product-related risks or product-related information resulted in
    an unsafe condition or injury to patients. Product liability
    lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls,
    regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material
    adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability
    to attract and retain customers.

Although we maintain third-party product liability insurance
    coverage, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the
    coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record
    a self-insured loss. Even if any product liability loss is
    covered by an insurance policy, these policies typically have
    substantial retentions or deductibles that we are responsible
    for. Product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

We began construction of our new 125,000 square feet

    manufacturing operations at this facility in the second half of
    2009. In an effort to expand our global distribution network, we
    have begun construction on a 130,000 square feet warehouse
    facility in Eschbach, Germany. We expect to begin utilizing this
    facility in the second half of 2009. We believe the current
    facilities, including manufacturing, warehousing, research and
    development and office space, together with the planned
    expansion provide sufficient capacity to meet ongoing demands.
    Once a facility reaches 85 percent utilization, we examine
    alternatives for either expanding that facility or acquiring new
    facilities to meet our ongoing demands.

In addition to the above, we maintain more than 100 other
    offices and warehouse facilities in more than 25 countries
    around the world, including the United States, Japan, Australia,
    France, Russia, India, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and China. We
    believe that all of the facilities and equipment are in good
    condition, well maintained and able to operate at present levels.

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
    conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
    corresponding notes included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW

We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture
    and marketing of orthopaedic and dental reconstructive implants,
    spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical products
    (sometimes referred to in this report as “OSP”). We
    also provide other healthcare related services. Orthopaedic
    reconstructive implants restore joint function lost due to
    disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and
    elbows. Dental reconstructive implants restore function and
    aesthetics in patients who have lost teeth due to trauma or
    disease. Spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons
    and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases,
    deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma
    products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize
    damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural
    healing process. OSP include supplies and instruments designed
    to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation
    rehabilitation. We have operations in more than
    25 countries and market products in more than 100
    countries. We manage operations through three reportable
    geographic segments – the Americas, Europe and Asia
    Pacific.

Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis
    are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and
    therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for
    disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2007 and 2006
    consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
    conform to the 2008 presentation.

Beginning in 2008, our Hips product category sales no longer
    include bone cement and accessory sales, which have been
    reclassified to our OSP and Other product category. Amounts in
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 related to sales
    of bone cement and accessory products have been reclassified to
    conform to the 2008 presentation.

We believe the following developments or trends are important in
    understanding our financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Demand (Volume
    and Mix) Trends

Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales
    contributed 3 percentage points of 2008 sales growth, which
    is 6 percentage points below the rate of growth from 2007
    compared to 2006. We estimate that the orthopaedic procedure
    volume market growth rate on a global basis will be in the mid
    single digits in the coming years driven by an aging global
    population, obesity and more active lifestyles, among other
    factors. In addition, the continued shift in demand to premium
    products, such as

Longevity

,

Durasul

and

Prolong

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylenes,

Trabecular
    Metal

Technology products, high-flex knees, knee revision
    products and porous hip stems, continue to positively affect
    sales growth. Our 2008 increase of 3 percentage points
    decreased from 2007 and was lower than market growth due to the
    factors discussed below.

Pricing Trends

Selling prices were flat during 2008, which is similar to 2007
    when compared to 2006. Asia Pacific selling prices decreased
    3 percentage points for the year ended December 31,
    2008, compared to a 1 percent decrease in 2007 when
    compared to 2006. Japan and Australia reported 4 percent
    and 3 percent decreases, respectively, in average selling
    prices as a result of scheduled reductions in reimbursement
    prices. Japan and Australia combined represent approximately
    10 percent of our sales. Selling prices in the Americas
    were flat during 2008, compared to a 1 percent increase in
    2007. In Europe, selling prices for 2008 were flat, compared to
    a 1 percent decrease in 2007. With the effect of
    governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and pressure
    from group purchasing organizations, we expect global selling
    prices to remain flat in 2009.

Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rates

For 2008, foreign currency exchange rates had a positive
    3 percent effect on global sales growth. If foreign
    currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end
    rates, we estimate that a stronger dollar versus foreign
    currency exchange rates will have a negative effect in 2009 of
    approximately 4 percent on sales. We address currency risk
    through regular operating and financing activities, and, under
    appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization,
    through the use of forward contracts and options solely for
    managing foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to
    foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to
    offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which
    are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net
    earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal.

Abbott Spine
    Acquisition

In October 2008, we acquired Abbott Spine, previously a
    subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, for approximately
    $360 million. The purchase price was funded by a
    combination of cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit
    facilities. This investment adds a number of innovative products
    and helps build toward critical mass in the Spine product
    category. The acquisition also enhances our research and
    development capabilities in the Spine product category and
    strengthens our sales coverage. We recorded $48.7 million
    of acquisition and integration costs in 2008 as a result of this
    transaction, including $38.5 million of in-process research
    and development expense. For more information regarding the
    acquisition of Abbott Spine, see Note 4 to the consolidated
    financial statements included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

ANNUAL REPORT

Compliance-Related
    Matters

In September 2007, we and other major U.S. orthopaedic
    manufacturers reached a settlement with the U.S. government
    to resolve claims related to an investigation into financial
    relationships between the industry and consulting orthopaedic
    surgeons. We paid the government $169.5 million and entered
    into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) under which we will
    remain subject to oversight by a federally-appointed monitor
    through March 27, 2009.

We also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with
    the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department
    of Health and Human Services, which has a term of 5 years.
    For more information regarding the settlement, see Note 16
    to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
    this

Form 10-K.

We did not record any tax benefit related to the
    $169.5 million payment in 2007. During 2008, we reached an
    agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service confirming
    the deductibility of a portion of the payment and recorded a
    current tax benefit of $31.7 million, resulting in a
    decrease to the current period effective tax rate. For more
    information regarding the tax treatment of the settlement
    expense, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial
    statements included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

We have developed and substantially implemented enhanced global
    compliance initiatives which address areas such as product
    development, marketing, surgeon training and educational and
    charitable funding. The principles of this program meet or
    exceed the requirements of the DPA and CIA, as those principles
    are being applied in most respects to all product segments and
    reach all worldwide operations. Costs related to the DPA, CIA
    and the enhanced compliance initiatives in 2008 were
    approximately $60 million, including the fees incurred for
    the federally-appointed monitor.

Durom Acetabular
    Component

In July 2008, we temporarily suspended marketing and
    distribution of the

Durom

Acetabular Component (

Durom

Cup) in the U.S. to permit us to update product
    labeling to provide more detailed surgical technique
    instructions and implement an enhanced surgical training program
    in the U.S. We resumed marketing and distribution of the

Durom

Cup in the U.S. in August 2008.

During 2008, we received claims from a number of

Durom

Cup patients seeking reimbursement for costs and payments
    for alleged pain and suffering and we expect to receive
    additional similar claims. We recorded a provision for certain
    claims of $69.0 million in 2008, which represents
    management’s estimate of liability to patients undergoing
    revision surgeries related to the

Durom

Cup. The estimate
    is limited to revisions associated with surgeries occurring
    before July 2008 and within two years of the original surgery
    date. Any claims received outside of these defined parameters
    will be managed in the normal course and reflected in our
    standard product liability accruals.

We believe we lost hip product sales during 2008, in large part
    as a consequence of the events involving the

Durom

Cup.
    In addition, we expect that our entry into the U.S. hip
    resurfacing market has been hindered or delayed as the

Durom

Cup had previously been integral to our plans for entry into
    that market.

Orthopaedic
    Surgical Products (OSP) Actions

In the first half of 2008, we initiated voluntary product
    recalls of certain OSP patient care products manufactured at our
    Dover, Ohio facility that we determined did not meet internal
    quality standards and we temporarily suspended production and
    sales of certain OSP products manufactured at the Dover
    facility. We estimate that these actions adversely impacted 2008
    OSP revenues by approximately $70 million and 2008 diluted
    earnings per share by $0.18 including related inventory charges,
    idle plant costs and other non-recurring charges. We expect to
    have a significant portion of these products back in production
    in the first quarter of 2009, with most other products coming
    back into production in the second quarter of 2009.

Impact of
    Disruptive Events on Market Share

As a result of the disruptive factors discussed above, including
    our temporary suspension of U.S. marketing and distribution
    of the

Durom

Cup, our voluntary recall and suspension of
    production of certain OSP patient care products, and the
    implementation of our enhanced global compliance initiatives, we
    have suffered customer losses during 2008. We estimate that
    these customer losses reduced our knee and hip market share by
    1.5 to 2.0 percent as measured from fourth quarter results.
    We expect our sales growth to be at a rate slower than the
    market in the near term due to these disruptive factors.

2009 Outlook

We expect conditions in the broader economy will result in a
    temporary slowdown in elective hospital procedures. Although
    many of our products are used in elective procedures, we believe
    our core knee and hip franchises remain more insulated than most
    from swings in the broader economy because the need for these
    procedures does not diminish, even if the timing is affected.

We expect to experience further customer losses in 2009
    affecting our knee and hip market share as a result of the
    ongoing effects of the disruptive factors discussed above. Our
    assumption is that share loss should stabilize by year-end 2009,
    as we anniversary out of the majority of the 2008 customer and
    product-related losses, and as we launch new products in
    sufficient quantities to recover some of the product-related
    losses.

Among our other product categories, we expect extremities and
    trauma sales growth to be in line with market growth rates. We
    expect dental revenues to reflect the weak economic environment
    and to underperform relative to market growth rates given
    company-specific operational challenges. Finally, we expect
    spine revenues to increase as a result of the Abbott Spine
    acquisition and reflect sales dis-synergies associated with the
    ongoing integration of the two businesses.

ANNUAL REPORT

In 2009, our operating expenses will be impacted by a number of
    factors, which in the aggregate are expected to result in a
    modest net decrease in total expense compared to 2008. We expect
    to realize significant savings from third-party fees related to
    compliance with the DPA and the implementation of our enhanced
    compliance initiatives, Durom-related certain claims and
    acquisition, integration and other expenses. For 2009, however,
    we intend to partially offset those savings with increased
    spending in areas that suffered disruption in 2008, including
    product development and medical education. We also continue to

step-up

our
    level of spending on quality systems to achieve our continuous
    improvement objectives in the areas of design and process
    control as well as ongoing product surveillance.

LCCK Revision Knee, led knee sales. In addition,
    the

Zimmer

    partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems.

Trabecular Metal

Acetabular Cups and

Longevity

and

Durasul

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners also had
    strong growth. The temporary suspension of marketing and
    distribution of the

Durom

Cup in the U.S. negatively
    impacted hip sales growth. Additionally, with the lack of a hip
    resurfacing product within our U.S. hip portfolio, we
    expect to face a continuing challenge in hip sales growth with
    the adoption of hip resurfacing in the U.S. market.

As a result of the disruptive factors discussed above, we
    suffered customer losses during 2008. We estimate that these
    customer losses reduced our knee and hip market share by 1.5 to
    2.0 percent as measured from fourth quarter results. We
    expect to experience further customer losses in 2009 as a result
    of the ongoing effects of these disruptive factors.

As a result of the disruptive factors discussed above, we

    negatively impacted sales growth, primarily in the knee and hip
    product segments. We expect to experience further customer
    losses in 2009 as a result of the ongoing effects of these
    disruptive factors.

The

Bigliani/Flatow

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 75.8 percent
    in 2008, compared to 77.5 percent in 2007. The following

Year ended December 31, 2008 gross margin

75.8

Gross margin decreased in 2008 primarily due to the unfavorable
    effect of year-over-year changes in foreign currency hedge gains
    and losses as well as an increase in excess inventory and
    obsolescence charges due to write-offs related to the OSP
    patient care product recalls and increased inventory levels as a
    result of lower than forecasted sales. Inventory

step-up

related to the completion of the Abbott Spine acquisition during
    2008 also had an unfavorable impact on gross margin.

Operating
    Expenses

Research and Development, or R&D, as a percentage of net
    sales was 4.7 percent for 2008, compared to
    5.4 percent in 2007. R&D decreased to
    $194.0 million for 2008 from $209.6 million in 2007,
    reflecting decreased spending on certain development, clinical
    and external research activities due to delays connected with
    our operational compliance with the DPA and CIA and
    implementation of our enhanced compliance and ethics
    initiatives. We do not expect delays with our development
    programs in 2009 and therefore our R&D expense as a
    percentage of revenue is expected to return to historical levels
    of 5 to 6 percent.

Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, as a
    percentage of net sales was 41.3 percent for 2008, compared
    to 38.2 percent in 2007. SG&A expense increased to
    $1,702.3 million for 2008, from $1,489.7 million in
    2007. Increased SG&A costs include monitor fees as well as
    consulting and legal fees associated with the global
    implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives. Expenses
    related to other operating initiatives also caused an increase
    in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Such operating
    initiatives include the planned implementation of a global IT
    system and improving quality systems at our Dover facility.
    Additionally, selling costs increased as a result of the
    ORTHOsoft acquisition, an increase in the headcount of our sales
    force in certain locations, increased commission incentives to
    sell certain key products and a change in the mix of commissions
    earned as a result of lower OSP sales.

Settlement expense of $169.5 million for 2007 relates to
    the settlement of the federal investigation into financial
    relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and
    consulting orthopaedic surgeons.

ANNUAL REPORT

Certain claims expense of $69.0 million is a provision for
    estimated claims from

Durom

Cup patients undergoing
    revision surgeries within specified periods. Acquisition,
    integration and other expenses increased to $68.5 million
    for 2008, compared to $25.2 million in 2007. The
    acquisition, integration and other expenses recorded during 2008
    include $38.5 million for in-process research and
    development related to the Abbott Spine acquisition, costs
    related to the integration of Abbott Spine, facility
    consolidation costs, legal fees, and retention and termination
    payments, partially offset by favorable adjustments to certain
    liabilities of acquired companies. The acquisition, integration
    and other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect in-process
    research and development write-offs related to acquisitions,
    costs related to the integration of acquired
    U.S. distributors, estimated settlements for certain
    pre-acquisition product liability claims, integration consulting
    fees and costs for integrating information technology systems.

Operating
    Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings

Operating profit for 2008 decreased 3 percent to
    $1,090.0 million, from $1,127.6 million in 2007.
    Operating profit for 2007 includes the effect of the
    non-recurring settlement expense of $169.5 million.
    Excluding the impact of the settlement expense in 2007,
    operating profit for 2008 would still have been unfavorable
    compared to 2007 as a result of lower gross margins, significant
    but temporary increases in SG&A costs attributable to the
    implementation of our enhanced compliance initiatives and
    certain claims expense of $69.0 million.

Interest and other income for 2008 increased to
    $31.8 million, from $4.0 million in 2007. Interest and
    other income for 2008 includes a realized gain of
    $38.8 million related to the sale of certain marketable
    securities, partially offset by increased interest expense as a
    result of an increase in outstanding long-term debt.

The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and
    minority interest decreased to 24.3 percent for 2008, down
    from 31.6 percent in 2007. The effective tax rate for the
    2007 period reflects the effect of the $169.5 million
    settlement expense, for which no tax benefit had previously been
    recognized. During 2008, we recorded a current tax benefit of
    $31.7 million related to the settlement expense, resulting
    in a decrease of approximately 3 percent to the current
    period effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2008 was
    further reduced as a result of increased profits in lower tax
    jurisdictions. These decreases in the effective tax rate were
    partially offset by Abbott Spine acquisition-related in-process
    research and development charges recorded during 2008 for which
    no tax benefit was recorded.

Net earnings increased 10 percent to $848.6 million
    for 2008, compared to $773.2 million in 2007, as the
    decrease in operating profit was more than offset by favorable
    items in interest and other income and a lower effective tax
    rate. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased
    14 percent to $3.73 and $3.72, respectively, from $3.28 and
    $3.26 in 2007. The higher growth rate in earnings per share as
    compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of 2008 and
    2007 share repurchases.

Changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales
    by 9 percent and hip sales by 8 percent. Excluding
    these foreign exchange rate effects, the following product
    categories experienced positive sales growth in our Europe
    region: the

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution product line,
    including the

NexGen

LPS-Flex Knee,

NexGen Trabecular
    Metal

Tibial Components, the

NexGen

CR-Flex Knee, and
    the

Innex

Total Knee System. Growth in porous stems,
    including the

CLS Spotorno

Stem, led hip stem sales.

Longevity

    Elbow led extremities sales. The addition of a direct sales
    force in Italy as a result of a distributor acquisition
    contributed to growth in dental sales and the

Tapered
    Screw-Vent

Implant System led dental sales. The

Cable-Ready

Cable Grip System,

Zimmer

Periarticular Plates and the

Changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales
    by 5 percent and positively affected hip sales by
    2 percent. Reported decreases in average selling prices
    negatively affected hip sales by 3 percent. The

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution product line, including

NexGen
    Trabecular Metal

Tibial Components, the

NexGen

CR-Flex Knee and the

NexGen

LPS-Flex Knee led knee
    sales. Launch of the

Gender Solutions

Knee Femoral
    Implant in Australia also contributed to strong knee sales for
    the year. The continued conversion to porous stems, including
    the Fiber Metal Taper Stem from the

VerSys

Hip System,
    the

Alloclassic Zweymüller

Hip System and the

CLS
    Spotorno

Stem led hip stem sales. Sales of

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners and

Trabecular
    Metal

Acetabular Cups also exhibited growth.

Extremities sales increased due to stronger sales of our
    shoulder and elbow products. The

Tapered Screw-Vent

Implant System led dental sales. Trauma sales were led by
    strong growth in

Zimmer

Periarticular Plates and

Zimmer

Plates and Screws, but were partially offset by a
    reported 5 percent decrease in average selling prices
    during 2007. A registration issue with the

ST360

°

®

Spinal Fixation System in Japan resulted in a decrease in sales
    of this device, contributing to the negative growth in Spine
    sales for 2007. Powered surgical instruments and Bone Cement and
    accessories led OSP sales.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 77.5 percent
    in 2007, compared to 77.7 percent in 2006. The following

The unfavorable effect of year over year changes in foreign
    currency hedge gains and losses were partially offset by lower
    unit manufacturing costs due to productivity gains as well as
    favorable geographic sales mix. These gains were further offset
    by increased inventory charges due to the impact of our newer
    products on aging product lines.

Operating
    Expenses

R&D as a percentage of net sales was 5.4 percent for
    2007, which is unchanged from 2006. R&D increased to
    $209.6 million for 2007 from $188.3 million in 2006,
    reflecting increased spending on new product development across
    all of our product segments. In 2007, we continued to make
    investments in our research and development facilities in
    Warsaw, Indiana. We continued working with our third party
    partners on genetically engineered tissues for regenerative
    therapies, including soft tissue biological repair and
    replacement.

SG&A, as a percentage of net sales was 38.2 percent
    for 2007, compared to 38.8 percent in 2006. The improvement
    in SG&A as a percent of net sales from the prior year is
    due to sales growth and well controlled spending.

ANNUAL REPORT

Settlement expense of $169.5 million for 2007 relates to
    the settlement of the federal investigation into financial
    relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and
    consulting orthopaedic surgeons. Acquisition, integration and
    other items for 2007 were $25.2 million compared to
    $6.1 million in 2006. The acquisition, integration and
    other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect in-process research
    and development write-offs related to acquisitions, costs
    related to the integration of acquired U.S. distributors,
    estimated settlements for certain pre-acquisition product
    liability claims, integration consulting fees and costs for
    integrating information technology systems. The acquisition,
    integration and other expenses recorded during 2006 included
    $27.7 million of income related to three unrelated
    matters — the sale of the former Centerpulse Austin
    land and facilities for a gain of $5.1 million and the
    favorable settlement of two pre-acquisition contingent
    liabilities.

Operating
    Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings

Operating profit for 2007 decreased 3 percent to
    $1,127.6 million, from $1,165.2 million in 2006. The
    decrease is due principally to the $169.5 million
    settlement expense. Without the settlement expense, operating
    profit would have been favorable to 2006 due to increased sales
    and controlled operating expenses.

The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and
    minority interest increased to 31.6 percent for 2007, up
    from 28.6 percent in 2006. The increase in the effective
    tax rate is primarily due to the effect of the
    $169.5 million settlement expense in 2007 for which no tax
    benefit was recognized. Without the effect of the settlement
    expense, the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been
    favorable to 2006 due to increased profitability in lower tax
    jurisdictions.

Net earnings decreased 7 percent to $773.2 million for
    2007, compared to $834.5 million in 2006. The decrease was
    due to the $169.5 million settlement expense and the higher
    effective tax rate that resulted from the settlement expense.
    Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 4 percent to
    $3.28 and $3.26, respectively, from $3.43 and $3.40 in 2006 due
    to fewer outstanding shares as a result of our stock repurchase
    program.

LIQUIDITY AND
    CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows provided by operating activities were
    $1,038.1 million in 2008 compared to $1,084.4 million
    in 2007. The principal source of cash was net earnings of
    $848.6 million. Non-cash charges included in net earnings
    accounted for another $353.7 million of operating cash.
    Income tax-related balances decreased by $77.3 million in
    2008, primarily reflecting the impact of accelerated tax
    payments resulting from changes in Federal and State tax rules.
    All other items of operating cash flows accounted for a use of
    $86.9 million of cash pertaining to pension funding and to
    investments in working capital in support of sales services.
    Operating cash flows continued to be positively affected by
    delayed payments related to various contractual arrangements
    with healthcare professionals or institutions. For 2008, we
    estimate this delay had a positive effect on operating cash
    flows of approximately $26 million.

At December 31, 2008, we had 59 days of sales
    outstanding in trade accounts receivable, an increase of
    7 days when compared to December 31, 2007, reflecting
    a change in geographic mix of outstanding accounts receivable
    balances and a general weakening in the broader economy. At
    December 31, 2008, we had 344 days of inventory on
    hand, above December 31, 2007 by 86 days, reflecting a
    planned increase in field-based inventory deployments in the
    U.S., a build-out of our inventory pipeline for certain new
    products we are preparing to launch in 2009, lower than expected
    sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the year-over-year
    change in foreign currency hedge gains/losses impacting cost of
    goods sold.

Cash flows used in investing activities were $924.2 million
    in 2008, compared to $491.5 million in 2007. The most
    significant contributors to the increase in cash flows used in
    investing activities were the acquisition of Abbott Spine and
    the acquisition of intellectual property rights. Cash payments
    related to the acquisition of Abbott Spine were
    $363.0 million compared to total acquisition-related
    payments of $160.3 million in 2007, which related primarily
    to the acquisitions of Endius and ORTHOsoft. Acquired
    intellectual property rights of $109.4 million relate to
    lump-sum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and
    institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise
    would have been due under the terms of an existing contractual
    arrangement. These lump-sum payments were based upon a third
    party fair market valuation of the current net present value of
    the contractual arrangement. In 2009, we anticipate making
    additional lump-sum payments to acquire intellectual property
    rights. Additions to instruments during 2008 were
    $237.9 million compared to $138.5 million in 2007.
    Additions to instruments increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due
    to an increase in instrument deployments to permit our sales and
    distribution networks to respond more rapidly to changes in
    surgical demand patterns and capitalize on new business
    opportunities. In 2009, we expect to spend approximately
    $160 — $170 million on instruments to support new
    products and sales. Additions to other property, plant and
    equipment during 2008 were $250.0 million compared to
    $192.7 million in 2007. This increase reflects spending on
    planned infrastructure improvements such as opening a new
    manufacturing facility in Ireland, improving our quality system
    infrastructure and investing in a central distribution center
    for our Europe segment. During 2009, we expect to purchase
    approximately $230 — $240 million in other
    property, plant and equipment, reflecting the cash necessary to
    complete capital expansions initiated in 2008 as well as new
    product-related investments and normal replacement of older
    machinery and equipment. Also included in investing activities
    for 2008 is $54.9 million in proceeds from the sale of
    certain equity securities.

Cash flows used in financing activities were $343.5 million
    for 2008, compared to $399.5 million in 2007. We
    repurchased $737.0 million of our common stock in 2008 as
    compared with $576.3 million in 2007 under our stock

repurchase programs. We utilized cash generated from operating
    activities, $57.0 million in cash proceeds received from
    employee stock compensation plans and borrowings under credit
    facilities to fund the repurchases. During 2008, we borrowed
    $330.0 million from our existing credit facilities to fund
    stock repurchases and partially fund the acquisition of Abbott
    Spine.

We may use excess cash or further borrow from our credit
    facilities to repurchase additional common stock under the
    $1.25 billion program which expires December 31, 2009.

We have a five year $1,350 million revolving,
    multi-currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing
    November 30, 2012 (the “Senior Credit Facility”).
    We had $460.1 million outstanding under the Senior Credit
    Facility at December 31, 2008, and an availability of
    $889.9 million. The Senior Credit Facility contains
    provisions by which we can increase the line to
    $1,750 million and request that the maturity date be
    extended for two additional one-year periods.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the
    borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes
    and bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus an applicable
    margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term
    credit rating and the amounts drawn under the Senior Credit
    Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a fixed rate
    determined through a competitive bid process. The Senior Credit
    Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants
    and events of default for an unsecured financing arrangement,
    including, among other things, limitations on consolidations,
    mergers and sales of assets. Financial covenants include a
    maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest
    coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If we fall below an investment
    grade credit rating, additional restrictions would result,
    including restrictions on investments, payment of dividends and
    stock repurchases. We were in compliance with all covenants
    under the Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2008.
    Commitments under the Senior Credit Facility are subject to
    certain fees, including a facility and a utilization fee. The
    Senior Credit Facility is rated A- by Standard &
    Poor’s Ratings Services and is not rated by Moody’s
    Investors’ Service, Inc. Notwithstanding recent
    interruptions in global credit markets, as of the date of this
    report, we believe our access to our Senior Credit Facility has
    not been impaired.

In October 2008, we funded a portion of the acquisition of
    Abbott Spine with approximately $110 million of new
    borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. Each of the lenders
    under the Senior Credit Facility funded its portion of the new
    borrowings in accordance with its commitment percentage.

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
    $71.4 million.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, together
    with available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, are
    sufficient to meet our expected working capital, capital
    expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment
    opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet
    and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if
    necessary.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our financial results are affected by the selection and
    application of accounting policies and methods. Significant
    accounting policies which require management’s judgment are
    discussed below.

Excess Inventory and Instruments

– We must
    determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our
    inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at
    our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if
    instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain
    undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are
    established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to
    net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of
    reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to
    historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our
    products and instrument systems and components. The basis for
    the determination is generally the same for all inventory and
    instrument items and categories except for

work-in-progress

inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued
    items are generally destroyed and completely written off.
    Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves
    based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other
    factors on a regular basis.

Income Taxes

– We estimate income tax expense
    and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction.
    Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction
    is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income
    sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax
    assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if
    it is determined to be “more likely than not” that the
    deferred tax benefit will not be realized. Federal income taxes
    are provided on the portion of the income of foreign
    subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. We
    operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions. We are subject to
    regulatory



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and
    those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to
    resolve. We make use of all available information and make
    reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in
    establishing tax expense, liabilities and reserves. We believe
    adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and
    jurisdictions subject to review or audit.

Commitments and Contingencies

– Accruals for
    product liability and other claims are established with the
    assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on
    current information and historical settlement information for
    claims, related fees and for claims incurred but not reported.
    We use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an
    appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims.
    Historical patterns of claim loss development over time are
    statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then
    applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model. During 2008,
    in addition to our general product liability estimates, we
    recorded a provision for certain claims of $69.0 million
    representing management’s estimate of liability to

Durom

Cup patients undergoing revisions associated with surgeries
    occurring before July 2008 and within two years of the original
    surgery date. These parameters are consistent with our data
    which indicates that cup loosenings associated with surgical
    technique are most likely to occur within that time period. Any
    claims received outside of these defined parameters will be
    managed in the normal course and reflected in our standard
    product liability accruals. The amounts established for our
    general product liability estimates, excluding certain claims
    for the

Durom

Cup, equate to less than 5 percent of
    total liabilities and represent management’s best estimate
    of the ultimate costs that we will incur under the various
    contingencies.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

– We evaluate
    the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible
    assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate
    the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the
    carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events
    or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate
    the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably
    estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such,
    these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable
    inputs as defined under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. Changes to
    these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges
    on these assets.

Share-based Payment

– We account for
    share-based payment expense in accordance with the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R). Under the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), share-based payment
    expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of
    the award and is recognized over the requisite service period.
    Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant
    date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life
    of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock.
    Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share-based awards
    that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected
    volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively
    traded options. The expected life of stock options and estimated
    forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical
    exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions used in
    determining the grant date fair value and the expected
    forfeitures represent management’s best estimates.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

MARKET
    RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing
    business operations, including risks from changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices
    that could affect our financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market
    risks through regular operating and financing activities, and
    through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use
    derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools
    and not for speculative investment purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
    EXCHANGE RISK

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
    could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency
    exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets
    denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British
    Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won. We
    manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined
    basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of
    any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign
    exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign
    currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in
    the form of foreign exchange forward contracts and options with
    major financial institutions. These forward contracts and
    options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency
    transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase
    transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized
    and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options
    that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in
    other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products
    sold when the hedged item affects net earnings.

For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008, we had
    obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros,
    Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian
    Dollars and Korean Won or purchase Swiss Francs and sell
    U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January
    2009 through June 2011. The notional amounts of outstanding
    forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase
    U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
    $1,343.0 million and $1,244.6 million, respectively.
    The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered
    into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $207.5 million and
    $138.4 million, respectively. The weighted average contract
    rates outstanding are Euro:USD 1.41, USD:Swiss Franc 1.10,
    USD:Japanese Yen 101, British Pound:USD 1.86, USD:Canadian
    Dollar 1.09, Australian Dollar:USD 0.82 and USD:Korean Won 1,000.

We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk
    management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms
    of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted
    transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges,
    changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are
    generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the
    fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management
    program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess
    potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and
    financial position relating to hypothetical movements in
    currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in
    the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding
    at December 31, 2008 indicated that, if the
    U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent
    relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound,
    Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Korean Won, with no
    change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those
    contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income
    taxes in periods through 2011, depending on the direction of the
    change, by an average approximate amount of $72.3 million,
    $21.1 million, $32.4 million, $10.4 million,
    $7.1 million, $7.2 million and $1.9 million for
    the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian
    Dollar, Australian Dollar and Korean Won contracts,
    respectively. Any change in the fair value of foreign exchange
    forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency
    exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in
    the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign
    exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to
    exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these
    contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities,
    and transactions being hedged.

We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency
    denominated assets and liabilities of approximately
    $2,003 million at December 31, 2008, primarily in
    Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and Euros. Approximately
    $1,234 million of the net asset exposure at
    December 31, 2008 relates to goodwill recorded in the
    Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and
    liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
    entity’s functional currency. As a result, foreign currency
    remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings under
    SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation,”
    are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period.

COMMODITY PRICE
    RISK

We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome,
    titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into
    supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months,
    where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of
    market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk management
    program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential
    commodity price changes. A 10 percent price change across
    all these commodities would not have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

INTEREST RATE
    RISK

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk
    from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of
    operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to
    interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing
    activities.

Presently, we invest our cash and equivalents primarily in
    U.S. government treasury funds and bank deposits. The
    primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation
    of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market
    risk. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments
    in our investment portfolio.

Our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the
    variable rates associated with our credit facilities. We are
    subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest
    rates on the committed Senior Credit Facility and our
    uncommitted credit facilities. Presently, all of our debt
    outstanding bears interest at short-term rates. We currently do
    not hedge our interest rate exposure, but we may do so in the
    future. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of
    December 31, 2008, a change of 10 percent in interest
    rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would
    not have a material effect on interest expense. Further, this
    analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level
    of overall economic activity that could exist in such an
    environment.

CREDIT
    RISK

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash, cash
    equivalents, counterparty transactions, and accounts receivable.

We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions
    and money market instruments, and limit the amount of credit
    exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any
    significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and
    investments.

We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with
    which we conduct business fail to perform. However, this loss is
    limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the
    counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our
    obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing
    with a diversified group of major financial institutions. We
    manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our
    counterparties using standard credit guidelines. We do not
    anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
    receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and
    their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by
    frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to
    whom credit is granted in the normal course of business.
    However, essentially all of our trade receivables are
    concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare
    industry in the U.S. and internationally or with
    distributors or dealers who operate in international markets
    and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business,
    economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent
    upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the
    respective countries’ national economic and healthcare
    systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit
    approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and we
    believe that reserves for losses are adequate. There is no
    significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other
    major concentration of credit risk.

Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the company’s Board of Directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, the
    company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

.

Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2008, the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The company’s independent registered public accounting firm
    has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
    as stated in its report which appears in Item 8 of this
    Annual Report on

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board
    of Directors of Zimmer Holdings, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Zimmer
    Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
    responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of
    Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements and on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
    our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain tax positions in 2007. As discussed in Note 2
    to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed
    the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and
    other postretirement plans effective December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    implants restore function and aesthetics in patients who have
    lost teeth due to trauma or disease. Spinal implants are
    utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the
    treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in
    all regions of the spine. Trauma products are devices used
    primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to
    support the body’s natural healing process. Our related
    surgical products include surgical supplies and instruments
    designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and
    post-operation rehabilitation. We have operations in more than
    25 countries and market our products in more than 100 countries.
    We operate in a single industry but have three reportable
    geographic segments, the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.

The words “we”, “us”, “our” and
    similar words refer to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

– The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Zimmer Holdings and
    its subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling equity
    position. Investments in companies in which we exercise
    significant influence over the operating and financial affairs,
    but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method.
    Under the equity method, we record the investment at cost and
    adjust the carrying amount of the investment by our
    proportionate share of the investee’s net earnings or
    losses. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
    are eliminated. Certain amounts in the 2007 and 2006
    consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
    conform to the 2008 presentation.

Use of Estimates

– The consolidated financial
    statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that
    are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

– The financial
    statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into
    U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and
    liabilities and average exchange rates for operating results.
    Unrealized translation gains and losses are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’
    equity. When a transaction is denominated in a currency other
    than the subsidiary’s functional currency, we recognize a
    transaction gain or loss when the transaction is settled.
    Foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in net
    earnings for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
    2006 were not significant.

Revenue Recognition

– We sell product through
    three principal channels: 1) direct to healthcare
    institutions, referred to as direct channel accounts;
    2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers;
    and 3) directly to dental practices and dental
    laboratories. The direct channel accounts represent
    approximately 80 percent of our net sales. Through this
    channel, inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or
    customers so that products are available when needed for
    surgical procedures. No revenue is recognized upon the placement
    of inventory into consignment as we retain title and maintain
    the inventory on our balance sheet. Upon implantation, we issue
    an invoice and revenue is recognized. Pricing for products is
    generally predetermined by contracts with customers, agents
    acting on behalf of customer groups or by government regulatory
    bodies, depending on the market. Price discounts under group
    purchasing contracts are generally linked to volume of implant
    purchases by customer healthcare institutions within a specified
    group. At negotiated thresholds within a contract buying period,
    price discounts may increase. Sales to stocking distributors,
    healthcare dealers, dental practices and dental laboratories
    account for approximately 20 percent of our net sales. With
    these types of sales, revenue is recognized when title to
    product passes, either upon shipment of the product or in some
    cases upon implantation of the product. Product is generally
    sold at contractually fixed prices for specified periods.
    Payment terms vary by customer, but are typically less than
    90 days. In some cases sales incentives may be earned by a
    customer for purchasing a specified amount of our product. We
    estimate whether such incentives will be achieved and, if so,
    recognize these incentives as a reduction in revenue in the same
    period the underlying revenue transaction is recognized.
    Occasionally products are returned and, accordingly, we maintain
    an estimated sales return reserve that is recorded as a
    reduction in revenue. Product returns were not significant for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

The reserves for doubtful accounts were $20.0 million and
    $21.7 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Shipping and Handling

– Amounts billed to
    customers for shipping and handling of products are reflected in
    net sales and are not significant. Expenses incurred related to
    shipping and handling of products are reflected in selling,
    general and administrative and were $117.3 million,
    $104.1 million and $95.5 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Acquisition, Integration and Other

– We
    recognize incremental expenses resulting directly from our
    business combinations and significant nonrecurring and unusual
    items as “Acquisition, integration and other”
    expenses. Acquisition, integration and other expenses for the
    years ended

Included in the gain on disposition, adjustment or impairment of
    acquired assets and obligations for 2008 is a favorable
    adjustment to certain liabilities of acquired companies due to
    changes in circumstances surrounding those liabilities
    subsequent to the related measurement period. Included in the
    gain on disposition, adjustment or impairment of acquired assets
    and obligations for 2006 is the sale of the former Centerpulse
    Austin land and facilities for a gain of $5.1 million and
    the favorable settlement of two pre-acquisition contingent
    liabilities. These gains were offset by a $13.4 million
    impairment charge for certain Centerpulse tradename and
    trademark intangibles based principally in our Europe operating
    segment. In-process research and development charges for 2008
    are related to the acquisition of Abbott Spine. In-process
    research and development charges for 2007 are related to the
    acquisitions of Endius and ORTHOsoft. Consulting and
    professional fees relate to third-party integration consulting
    performed in a variety of areas such as tax, compliance,
    logistics and human resources and legal fees related to matters
    involving acquired businesses.

Cash and Equivalents

– We consider all highly
    liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
    less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in
    the balance sheet for cash and equivalents are valued at cost,
    which approximates their fair value. Restricted cash is
    primarily composed of cash held in escrow related to certain
    insurance coverage.

Inventories

– Inventories, net of allowances
    for obsolete and slow-moving goods, are stated at the lower of
    cost or market, with cost determined on a

first-in

first-out basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

– Property, plant
    and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
    estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and
    improvements, three to eight years for machinery and equipment.
    Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. In accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we review
    property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an
    asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be
    recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows
    relating to the asset are less than its carrying amount. An
    impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying
    amount of an asset exceeds its fair value.

Software Costs

– We capitalize certain computer
    software and software development costs incurred in connection
    with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use
    when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is
    probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized
    software costs generally include external direct costs of
    materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining
    computer software and compensation and related benefits for
    employees who are directly associated with the software project.
    Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and
    equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line
    basis when the software is ready for its intended use over the
    estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate three
    to seven years.

Instruments

– Instruments are hand-held devices
    used by orthopaedic surgeons during total joint replacement and
    other surgical procedures. Instruments are recognized as
    long-lived assets and are included in property, plant and
    equipment. Undeployed instruments are carried at cost, net of
    allowances for excess and obsolete instruments. Instruments in
    the field are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
    average estimated useful lives, determined principally in
    reference to associated product life cycles, primarily five
    years. We review instruments for impairment in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144. Depreciation of instruments is
    recognized as selling, general and administrative expense.

Goodwill

– We account for goodwill in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.” Goodwill is not amortized but is
    subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill has been assigned
    to reporting units. We perform annual impairment tests by
    comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying
    amount to determine if there is potential impairment. The fair
    value of the reporting unit and the implied fair value of
    goodwill are determined based upon a discounted cash flow
    analysis. Significant assumptions are incorporated into to these
    discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth rates and
    risk-adjusted discount rates. We perform this test in the fourth
    quarter of the year. If the fair value of the reporting unit is
    less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to
    the extent that the implied fair value of the reporting unit
    goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit
    goodwill.

Intangible Assets

– We account for intangible
    assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Intangible
    assets are initially measured at their fair value. We have
    determined the fair value of our intangible assets either by the
    fair value of the



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements

(Continued)

consideration exchanged for the intangible asset, or the
    estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected to be
    generated from the intangible asset. Intangible assets with an
    indefinite life, including certain trademarks and trade names,
    are not amortized. Indefinite life intangible assets are
    assessed annually to determine whether events and circumstances
    continue to support an indefinite life. Intangible assets with a
    finite life, including core and developed technology, certain
    trademarks and trade names, customer-related intangibles,
    intellectual property rights and patents and licenses are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
    life, ranging from less than one year to 40 years. Intangible
    assets with a finite life are tested for impairment whenever
    events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
    not be recoverable. Intangible assets with an indefinite life
    are tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying
    amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. The amount
    of the impairment loss to be recorded would be determined based
    upon the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair
    value. The fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are
    determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis using the
    relief from royalty method. The relief from royalty method
    estimates the cost savings associated with owning, rather than
    licensing, assets. Significant assumptions are incorporated into
    to these discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth
    rates, royalty rates and risk-adjusted discount rates.

The useful lives of intangible assets range from less than
    one year to 40 years. In determining the useful lives
    of intangible assets, we consider the expected use of the assets
    and the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition,
    anticipated technological advances, changes in surgical
    techniques, market influences and other economic factors. For
    technology-based intangible assets, we consider the expected
    life cycles of products, absent unforeseen technological
    advances, which incorporate the corresponding technology.
    Trademarks and trade names that do not have a wasting
    characteristic (i.e., there are no legal, regulatory,
    contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit
    the useful life) are assigned an indefinite life. Trademarks and
    trade names that are related to products expected to be phased
    out are assigned lives consistent with the period in which the
    products bearing each brand are expected to be sold. For
    customer relationship intangible assets, we assign useful lives
    based upon historical levels of customer attrition. Intellectual
    property rights are assigned useful lives that approximate the
    contractual life of any related patent or the period for which
    we maintain exclusivity over the intellectual property.

Research and Development

– We expense all
    research and development costs as incurred. Research and
    development costs include salaries, prototypes, depreciation of
    equipment used in research and development, consultant fees and
    service fees paid to collaborative partners.

Income Taxes

– We account for income taxes in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes” and related interpretations, including
    FIN 48. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
    based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases
    of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
    rates in effect for the years in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. Federal income taxes are provided on the
    portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected
    to be remitted to the U.S.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– We account
    for all derivative financial instruments in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by
    SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
    Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 133)” and SFAS No. 149,
    “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133 requires that
    all derivative instruments be reported as assets or liabilities
    on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. We maintain
    written policies and procedures that permit, under appropriate
    circumstances and subject to proper authorization, the use of
    derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes.
    The use of derivative financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes is prohibited by our policy. We are exposed
    to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. As a
    result, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts and
    options to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on
    anticipated foreign currency transactions, generally
    intercompany sales and purchases expected to occur within the
    next twelve to thirty months. Derivative instruments that
    qualify as cash flow hedges are designated as such from
    inception. We maintain formal documentation regarding our
    objectives, the nature of the risk being hedged, identification
    of the instrument, the hedged transaction, the hedging
    relationship and how effectiveness of the hedging instrument
    will be assessed. Our policy requires that critical terms of a
    hedging instrument are effectively the same as a hedged
    forecasted transaction. On this basis, with respect to a cash
    flow hedge, changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged
    transaction are generally expected to be completely offset by
    the cash flows attributable to hedge instruments. We, therefore,
    perform quarterly assessments of hedge effectiveness by
    verifying and documenting those critical terms of the hedge
    instrument and that forecasted transactions have not changed. We
    also assess on a quarterly basis whether there have been adverse
    developments regarding the risk of a counterparty default. For
    derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the
    effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily
    recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in
    cost of products sold when the hedged item affects net earnings.
    The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair
    value, if any, is reported in cost of products sold immediately.
    The net amount recognized in earnings during

the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, due to
    ineffectiveness and amounts excluded from the assessment of
    hedge effectiveness, was not significant.

For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008, we have an
    obligation to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros,
    Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian
    Dollars and Korean Won and purchase Swiss Francs and sell
    U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January
    2009 through June 2011. The notional amounts of outstanding
    forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase
    U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2008 were
    $1,343.0 million. The notional amounts of outstanding
    forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase
    Swiss Francs at December 31, 2008 were $207.5 million.
    The fair value of outstanding derivative instruments recorded on
    the balance sheet at December 31, 2008, together with
    settled derivatives where the hedged item has not yet affected
    earnings, was a net unrealized gain of $32.7 million, or
    $33.0 million net of taxes, which is deferred in other
    comprehensive income, of which $16.4 million, or
    $17.9 million, net of taxes, is expected to be reclassified
    to earnings over the next twelve months.

We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts
    with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets
    and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
    entity’s functional currency. As a result, any foreign
    currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings under
    SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation,”
    are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period.

Other Comprehensive Income

– Other
    comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and
    losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are
    included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net
    earnings as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment
    to stockholders’ equity. Other comprehensive income is
    comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments,
    unrealized foreign currency hedge gains and losses, unrealized
    gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and
    amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and
    losses in actuarial assumptions. In 2006 we adopted
    SFAS 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
    132(R).” This statement required recognition of the funded
    status of our benefit plans in the statement of financial
    position and recognition of certain deferred gains or losses in
    other comprehensive income. We recorded an unrealized loss of
    $35.4 million in other comprehensive income during 2006
    related to the adoption of SFAS 158.

During 2008, we reclassified an investment previously accounted
    for under the equity method to an available-for-sale investment
    as we no longer exercised significant influence over the
    third-party investee. The investment was marked-to-market in
    accordance with SFAS 115, “Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” resulting in a
    net unrealized gain of $23.8 million recorded in other
    comprehensive income for 2008. This unrealized gain was
    reclassified to the income statement when we sold this
    investment in 2008 for total proceeds of $54.9 million and
    a gross realized gain of $38.8 million included in interest
    and other income. The basis of these securities was determined
    based on the consideration paid at the time of acquisition.

Treasury Stock

– We account for repurchases of
    common stock under the cost method and present treasury stock as
    a reduction of shareholders equity. We may reissue common stock
    held in treasury only for limited purposes.

Accounting Pronouncements

– In September 2006,
    the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” which defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
    accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. This Statement does not require any new fair value
    measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value
    by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source
    of the information. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
    financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (FSP)

No. SFAS 157-2,

which delays the effective date of certain provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 relating to non-financial assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis
    until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The
    full adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have
    a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or
    results of operations.

(Continued)

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations,” which is a revision of
    SFAS No. 141 “Business Combinations.”
    SFAS No. 141(R) will change the way in which we
    account for business combinations. The Statement introduces new
    purchase accounting concepts, expands the use of fair value
    accounting related to business combinations and changes the
    subsequent period accounting for certain acquired assets and
    liabilities, among other things. SFAS No. 141(R) will
    be applied prospectively on business combinations with
    acquisition dates in fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, and therefore this statement will not
    affect our financial statements for business combinations that
    preceded the effective date. For deferred tax assets and income
    tax reserves recorded as part of business combinations, these
    assets will be accounted for under SFAS 109 and FIN 48
    after the effective date regardless of the acquisition date.
    Therefore, if a remeasurement of those assets and liabilities is
    warranted after the effective date of this statement, it may
    affect our income tax expense in the period in which the
    remeasurement occurs.

In December 2007, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB 51.” SFAS No. 160
    will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests,
    which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and
    classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160
    requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure
    requirements for existing minority interests.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    on or after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within
    those fiscal years. We do not expect that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 will have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133.”
    SFAS No. 161 will require increased disclosure of our
    derivative and hedging activities, including how derivative and
    hedging activities affect our consolidated statement of
    earnings, balance sheet and cash flows. SFAS No. 161
    is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. The adoption of SFAS No. 161 will increase the
    required disclosure of our derivative and hedging activities,
    but will not have any impact on our financial position or
    results of operations.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Our share-based payments primarily consist of stock options,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance
    shares and an employee stock purchase plan. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, share-based payment expense was
    $69.9 million or $49.5 million net of the related tax
    benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2007, share-based
    payment expense was $70.1 million or $48.1 million net
    of the related tax benefits. For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, share-based payment expense was
    $76.0 million or $54.5 million net of the related tax
    benefits.

Stock
    Options

We had three equity compensation plans in effect at
    December 31, 2008: the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2006 Plan”), the TeamShare Stock Option Plan and the
    Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2006 Plan replaced
    the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2001 Plan”), which
    by its terms expired in August 2006. Following stockholder
    approval of the 2006 Plan in May 2006, no further awards were
    granted under the 2001 Plan. However, vested and unvested stock
    options previously granted under the 2001 Plan remained
    outstanding as of December 31, 2008. We have reserved the
    maximum number of shares of common stock available for award
    under the terms of each of these plans and have registered
    52.9 million shares of common stock. The 2006 Plan provides
    for the grant of nonqualified stock options and incentive stock
    options, long-term performance awards in the form of performance
    shares or units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and
    stock appreciation rights. The Compensation and Management
    Development Committee of the Board of Directors determines the
    grant date for annual grants under our equity compensation
    plans. The date for annual grants under the 2006 Plan to our
    executive officers is expected to occur in February of each year
    following the earnings announcements for the previous quarter
    and full year. The TeamShare Stock Option Plan provides for the
    grant of non-qualified stock options and, in certain
    jurisdictions, stock appreciation rights, while the Stock Plan
    for Non-Employee Directors provides for awards of stock options,
    restricted stock and restricted stock units to non-employee
    directors. It has been our practice to issue shares of common
    stock upon exercise of stock options from previously unissued
    shares. The total number of awards which may be granted in a
    given year

and/or

over
    the life of the plan under each of our equity compensation plans
    is limited. At December 31, 2008, an aggregate of
    11.2 million shares were available for future grants and
    awards under these plans.

Stock options granted to date under our plans generally vest
    over four years and generally have a maximum contractual life of
    10 years. We recognize expense related to stock options on
    a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire
    award, less awards expected to be forfeited using estimated
    forfeiture rates. Stock options are granted with an exercise
    price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date
    of grant, except in limited circumstances where local law may
    dictate otherwise. In the past, certain options have had price
    thresholds, which affect exercisability. All such price
    thresholds have been satisfied. The total number of awards which
    may be granted in a given year

and/or

over
    the life of the plan under each of our stock option plans is
    limited to control dilution.

We use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the
    fair value of our stock options. Expected volatility was derived
    from the implied volatility of our traded options that were
    actively traded around the grant date of the stock options with
    exercise prices similar to the stock options and maturities of
    over one year. The expected term of the stock options has been
    derived from historical employee exercise behavior. The
    risk-free interest rate is determined using the implied yield
    currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues
    with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options.
    A dividend yield of zero percent has been used as we have not
    paid a dividend since becoming a public company in 2001.

The weighted average fair value of the options granted in the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were
    determined using the following assumptions:

The weighted average fair value for options granted during 2008,

    total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $31.9 million, $124.5 million and $40.5 million,
    respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006, share-based payment expense related to stock options
    was $65.4 million, $73.4 million and
    $66.3 million, respectively, or $46.3 million,
    $50.4 million and $47.7 million net of the related tax
    benefits, respectively.

    to be recognized over a weighted average period of

We granted performance shares and performance-based RSUs in 2006
    and 2007, respectively, the vesting of which depended on the
    achievement of objective performance targets over periods ended
    December 31, 2008. The

performance targets related to these awards were not met and the
    related performance shares and RSUs were forfeited. We also
    granted RSUs in December 2007. These RSUs are not tied to our
    performance and vest ratably on the first and second
    anniversaries of the date of grant, provided that the recipient
    is still our employee. Each of these awards are converted into
    one share of our common stock upon vesting.

    the year ended December 31, 2008 is as follows (Performance

The fair value of the awards was determined based upon the fair
    market value of our common stock on the date of grant.
    SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the number of
    performance shares and RSUs that will vest, and recognize
    share-based payment expense on a straight line basis over the
    requisite service period. As of December 31, 2008, we
    estimate that all 169,000 outstanding RSUs will vest. If our
    estimate were to change in the future, the cumulative effect of
    the change in estimate will be recorded in that period. Based
    upon the number of RSUs that we expect to vest, the unrecognized
    share-based payment expense as of December 31, 2008 was
    $10.0 million, and is expected to be recognized over a
    period of 1.4 years. For the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, pre-tax expense (income) related to these
    awards was $4.5 million, $(3.3) million and
    $9.7 million, respectively, or $3.2 million,
    $(2.3) million and $6.8 million net of the related tax
    benefits, respectively.

ACQUISITIONS

We made acquisitions during the years 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
    more significant of which are described below. These
    acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting pursuant to SFAS No. 141. Accordingly, the
    results of operations of the acquired companies have been
    included in our consolidated results of operations subsequent to
    the transaction dates, and the respective assets and liabilities
    of the acquired companies have been recorded at their estimated
    fair values in our consolidated statement of financial position
    as of the transaction dates, with any excess purchase price
    being allocated to goodwill. Pro forma financial information and
    other information required by SFAS No. 141 have not
    been included as the acquisitions did not have a material impact
    upon our financial position or results of operations.

Abbott
    Spine

In October 2008, we acquired Abbott Spine, a former subsidiary
    of Abbott Laboratories, for an aggregate value of approximately
    $363.0 million, including a $358.0 million cash
    purchase price after certain working capital adjustments and
    $5.0 million of direct acquisition costs. The acquisition
    was funded by approximately $253 million of cash on-hand
    and $110 million from new borrowings under our Senior
    Credit Facility. This investment adds a number of innovative
    products and builds critical mass in the Spine product category.
    The acquisition also enhances our research and development
    capabilities in the Spine product category and strengthens our
    sales coverage.

We completed the preliminary purchase price allocation in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. The process included interviews with both Abbott
    Spine and our management, review of the economic and competitive
    environment and examination of assets including historical
    performance and future prospects. The preliminary purchase price
    allocation was based on information currently available to us,
    and expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by us. No
    assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions
    used to estimate expected technology-based product revenues,
    development costs or profitability, or the events associated
    with such technology will occur as projected. The final purchase
    price allocation may vary from the preliminary purchase price
    allocation. The final valuation and associated purchase price
    allocation is expected to be completed during the first half of
    2009. To the extent that the estimates need to be adjusted, we
    will do so.

The following table summarizes the preliminary estimate of fair
    values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
    date of the Abbott Spine acquisition (in millions):

(Continued)

Goodwill of $129.3 million, $65.7 million and
    $2.4 million was assigned to the Americas, Europe and Asia
    Pacific reporting segments, respectively. None of the goodwill
    is deductible for tax purposes.

In-process research and development charges relate to acquired
    technologies for which no alternative future use has been
    identified at the acquisition date. The values assigned to
    in-process research and development (IPR&D), are based on
    valuations that estimate the future cash flows of the related
    technologies and discounting the net cash flows back to their
    present values utilizing an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of
    return (discount rate). These valuations also include
    consideration of the risk of the project not achieving
    commercial feasibility and include a factor that takes into
    account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development
    of the IPR&D.

At the time of acquisition, we expect all acquired IPR&D
    will reach technological feasibility, but there can be no
    assurance that the commercial viability of these products will
    actually be achieved. The nature of the efforts to develop the
    acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists
    principally of planning, designing, and conducting clinical
    trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. The risks
    associated with achieving commercialization include, but are not
    limited to, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals to
    conduct clinical trials, delay or failure to obtain required
    market clearances, and patent issuance, validity and litigation,
    if any.

The $38.5 million of IPR&D primarily relates to
    projects in the following spine product categories:
    1) Thoracolumbar, 2) Minimally Invasive Surgery, and
    3) Cervical. The related products have projected launch
    dates beginning in 2009 through 2014, with estimated total costs
    to complete of approximately $8.5 million.

ORTHOsoft
    Inc.

In November 2007, we acquired ORTHOsoft Inc. (ORTHOsoft), a
    leader in computer navigation for orthopaedic surgery, in a cash
    transaction for an aggregate value of approximately
    $50 million. We recorded $31.3 million in goodwill in
    connection with the acquisition. The acquisition of ORTHOsoft
    bolsters our SmartTools strategic initiative to bring innovative
    tools to the marketplace that will help create better and more
    reproducible outcomes for surgeons and patients.

Endius
    Incorporated

In April 2007, we acquired Endius Incorporated (Endius), a
    privately held spinal products company based in Massachusetts,
    for an aggregate value of approximately $80 million in
    cash, before adjustments for debt repayment and other items. We
    recorded $38.5 million in goodwill in connection with the
    acquisition. Endius develops and manufactures minimally invasive
    spine surgery products, implants and techniques to treat spine
    disease. The acquisition of Endius has expanded our spine
    product portfolio to include innovative minimally invasive
    instruments and implants.

FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

On January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” as it
    relates to financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair
    value on a recurring basis. FSP

No. SFAS 157-2

has delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis. We do not expect that the full
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact
    on our consolidated financial statements or results of
    operations.

The following financial assets and liabilities are recorded at

During 2008 we made lump-sum payments of $109.4 million to
    certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of
    future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under
    the terms of existing contractual arrangements. Such payments
    were based upon a third party fair market valuation of the
    current net present value of the contractual arrangement. Under
    the terms of these resolutions, we acquired the exclusive rights
    to any intellectual property, patented and unpatented, provided
    by the healthcare professional or institution during the course
    of the original contractual arrangement. The weighted average
    useful life for these assets is 5.6 years, which represents
    the life of any related patent or the period for which we
    maintain exclusivity to the intellectual property. Amortization
    expense for these assets is reported as part of cost of goods
    sold.

As a result of the acquisition of Abbott Spine, we acquired
    developed technology-related intangible assets of approximately
    $64.3 million and customer relationship related intangible
    assets of approximately $8.6 million, based on the
    preliminary purchase price allocation as of December 31,
    2008. These assets each have a 10 year useful life.

Total amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets
    was $59.3 million, $47.4 million and
    $42.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. For 2008, $6.7 million of
    amortization expense was recorded as part of cost of goods sold,
    with the remaining $52.6 million recorded as part of
    selling, general and administrative expenses. For 2007 and 2006,
    all amortization expense was recorded as part of selling,
    general and administrative expenses. Estimated annual

DEBT

We have a five year $1,350 million senior credit agreement
    (the “Senior Credit Facility”). The Senior Credit
    Facility is a revolving, multi-currency, senior unsecured credit
    facility maturing November 30, 2012. Available borrowings
    under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2008 were
    $889.9 million. The Senior Credit Facility contains
    provisions whereby borrowings may be increased to
    $1,750 million and the maturity date may be extended for up
    to two one-year periods.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the
    borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus
    an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior
    unsecured long-term credit rating and the amounts drawn under
    the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a
    fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. The
    Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and
    negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured
    financing arrangement, including,

among other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and
    sales of assets. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage
    ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5
    to 1.0. If we fall below an investment grade credit rating,
    additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on
    investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were
    in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit
    Facility as of December 31, 2008. Commitments under the
    Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a
    facility and a utilization fee.

Outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2008 was
    $460.1 million and $104.3 million as of
    December 31, 2007. We had no current debt as of
    December 31, 2008 or 2007.

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
    $71.4 million.

The weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility was 3.2 percent at December 31,
    2008. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility were
    U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen-based borrowings at
    December 31, 2008 and Japanese Yen-based borrowings at
    December 31, 2007. We paid $14.0 million,
    $8.5 million and $5.8 million in interest during 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Debt issuance costs of $22.8 million were incurred to
    obtain the Senior Credit Facility arrangement. These costs were
    capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the lives
    of the related facility. At December 31, 2008, unamortized
    debt issuance costs were $3.5 million.

RETIREMENT
    BENEFIT PLANS

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain
    U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. The employees who are not
    participating in the defined benefit plans receive additional
    benefits under our defined contribution plans. Plan benefits are
    primarily based on years of credited service and the
    participant’s average eligible compensation. In addition to
    the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit pension plans, we
    sponsor various

non-U.S. pension

arrangements, including retirement and termination benefit plans
    required by local law or coordinated with government sponsored
    plans.

We use a December 31 measurement date for our benefit plans.

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets is based
    on the period expected benefits will be paid and the historical
    rates of return on the different asset classes held in the
    plans. The expected long-term rate of return is the weighted
    average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset
    class. We believe that historical asset results approximate
    expected market returns applicable to the funding of a long-term
    benefit obligation.

Discount rates were determined for each of our defined benefit
    retirement plans at their measurement date to reflect the yield
    of a portfolio of high quality bonds matched against the timing
    and amounts of projected future benefit payments.

The U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement
    plans’ overall investment strategy is to maximize total
    returns by emphasizing long-term growth of capital while
    avoiding risk. We have established target ranges of assets held
    by the plans of 50 to 75 percent for equity securities and
    25 to 50 percent for debt securities. The plans strive to
    have sufficiently diversified assets so that adverse or
    unexpected results from one asset class will not have an unduly
    detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. The investments in
    the plans are rebalanced quarterly based upon the target asset
    allocation of the plans.

The investment strategies of

non-U.S. based

plans vary according to the plan provisions and local laws. The
    majority of the assets in

non-U.S. based

plans are located in Switzerland based plans. These assets are
    held in trusts and are commingled with the assets of other Swiss
    companies, with representatives of all the companies making the
    investment decisions. The overall strategy is to maximize total
    returns while avoiding risk. The trustees of the assets have
    established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 30 to
    50 percent in debt securities, 20 to 37 percent in
    equity securities, 15 to 24 percent in real estate, 3 to
    15 percent in cash funds and 0 to 12 percent in other
    funds.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, our defined benefit
    pension plans’ assets did not hold any direct investment in
    Zimmer Holdings common stock.

We expect that we will have no minimum funding requirements by
    law in 2009 for the qualified U.S. and Puerto Rico defined
    benefit retirement plans, however, subsequent Congressional
    action may impact the minimum funding requirement for 2009. We
    expect to voluntarily contribute between $40 million to
    $50 million to these plans during 2009. Contributions to

non-U.S. defined

benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $11 million
    in 2009. We do not expect the plan assets in any of our plans to
    be returned to us in the next year.

The net operating loss carryovers are available to reduce future
    federal, state and foreign taxable earnings. At
    December 31, 2008, these net operating loss carryovers
    generally expire within a period of 1 to 20 years.
    Valuation allowances for net operating loss carryovers have been
    established in the amount of $18.9 million and
    $16.3 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The tax credit carryovers are available to offset
    future federal, state and foreign tax liabilities. At
    December 31, 2008, these tax credit carryovers generally
    expire within a period of 1 to 15 years. We have
    established valuation allowances for certain tax credit
    carryovers in the amount of $12.9 million and
    $20.2 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The remaining valuation allowances of
    $5.3 million and $17.5 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, relate primarily to potential
    capital losses. We have established valuation allowances related
    to certain business combination transactions through goodwill.
    These allowances were approximately $19.3 million and
    $33.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

At December 31, 2008, we had an aggregate of approximately
    $871 million of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    that have been, or are intended to be, indefinitely

reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. If the total
    undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted, a
    significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the
    allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practical for us to
    determine the additional tax of remitting these earnings.

In September 2007, we reached a settlement with the United
    States Department of Justice to resolve an investigation into
    financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers
    and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. Under the terms of the
    settlement, we paid a civil settlement amount of
    $169.5 million and we recorded an expense in that amount.
    At the time, no tax benefit was recorded related to the
    settlement expense due to the uncertainty as to the tax
    treatment. During the third quarter of 2008, we reached an
    agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    confirming the deductibility of a portion of the settlement
    payment. As a result, during 2008 we recorded a current tax
    benefit of $31.7 million.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48).
    FIN 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits
    claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be
    recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, we may
    recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
    it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
    technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
    the financial statements from such a position should be measured
    based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
    percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
    FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties on income taxes,
    accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.

We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. Prior to the
    adoption of FIN 48 we had a long term tax liability for
    expected settlement of various federal, state and foreign income
    tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary tax
    impact of these expected settlements of $102.1 million, as
    well as a separate accrued interest liability of
    $1.7 million. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48,
    we are required to present the different components of such
    liability on a gross basis versus the historical net
    presentation. The adoption resulted in the financial statement
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by
    $6.4 million as of January 1, 2007. The adoption
    resulted in this decrease in the liability as well as a
    reduction to retained earnings of $4.8 million, a reduction
    in goodwill of $61.4 million, the establishment of a tax
    receivable of $58.2 million, which was recorded in other
    current and non-current assets on our consolidated balance
    sheet, and an increase in an interest/penalty payable of
    $7.9 million, all as of January 1, 2007. Therefore,
    after the adoption of FIN 48, the amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits is $95.7 million as of January 1, 2007.

As of December 31, 2008, the amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits is $129.5 million. Of this amount,
    $45.5 million would impact our effective tax rate if
    recognized. $38.2 million of the $129.5 million
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions
    of acquired entities taken prior to their acquisition by us.
    Under FAS 141(R), if these liabilities are settled for
    different amounts, they will affect the income tax expense in
    the period of reversal or settlement.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts
    of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings, which is consistent with
    the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods. As of
    December 31, 2007, we recorded a liability of
    $19.6 million for accrued interest and penalties, of which
    $14.7 million would impact our effective tax rate, if
    recognized. The amount of this liability is $22.9 million
    as of December 31, 2008. Of this amount, $17.1 million
    would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.

We expect that the amount of tax liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits will change in the next twelve months; however, we do
    not expect these changes will have a significant impact on our
    results of operations or financial position.

The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for
    the year 2003 and onward. The U.S. federal returns for
    years 2003 and 2004 are currently under examination by the IRS.
    On July 15, 2008, the IRS issued its examination report. We
    filed a formal protest on August 15, 2008 and requested a
    conference with the Appeals Office regarding disputed issues.
    Although the appeals process could take several years, we do not
    anticipate resolution of the audit will result in any
    significant impact on our results of operations, financial
    position or cash flows. In addition, for the 1999 tax year of
    Centerpulse, which we acquired in October 2003, one issue
    remains in dispute.

State income tax returns are generally subject to examination
    for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective
    return. The state impact of any federal changes remains subject
    to examination by various states for a period of up to one year
    after formal notification to the states. We have various state
    income tax returns in the process of examination, administrative
    appeals or litigation. It is

reasonably possible that such matters will be resolved in the
    next twelve months, but we do not anticipate that the resolution
    of these matters would result in any material impact on our
    results of operations or financial position.

Foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally
    ranging from 3 to 5 years. Years still open to examination
    by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include
    Australia (2003 onward), Canada (2002 onward), France (2006
    onward), Germany (2005 onward), Italy (2005 onward), Japan (2002
    onward), Puerto Rico (2005 onward), Singapore (2003 onward),
    Switzerland (2006 onward) and the United Kingdom (2006 onward).

Our tax returns are currently under examination in various
    foreign jurisdictions. The most significant foreign tax
    jurisdiction under examination is the United Kingdom. It is
    reasonably possible that such audits will be resolved in the
    next twelve months, but we do not anticipate that the resolution
    of these audits would result in any material impact on our
    results of operations or financial position.

CAPITAL STOCK AND
    EARNINGS PER SHARE

We are authorized to issue 250 million shares of preferred
    stock, none of which were issued or outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008.

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is
    net earnings available to common stockholders. The denominator
    for basic earnings per share is the weighted average number of
    common shares outstanding during the period. The denominator for
    diluted earnings per share is weighted average shares
    outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options
    and other equity awards. The following is a reconciliation of
    weighted average shares for the basic and diluted share
    computations for the years ending December 31 (in millions):

For the year ended December 31, 2008, an average of
    11.2 million options to purchase shares of common stock
    were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
    share as the exercise prices of these options were greater than
    the average market price of the common stock. For the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, an average of
    3.1 million and 7.6 million options, respectively,
    were not included.

During 2008, we repurchased approximately 10.8 million
    shares of our common stock at an average price of $68.72 per
    share for a total cash outlay of $737.0 million, including
    commissions. In April 2008, we announced that our Board of
    Directors authorized a $1.25 billion share repurchase
    program which expires December 31, 2009. Approximately
    $1.13 billion remains authorized under this plan.

SEGMENT
    DATA

We design, develop, manufacture and market orthopaedic and
    dental reconstructive implants, spinal implants, trauma products
    and related surgical products which include surgical supplies
    and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical
    procedures and post-operation rehabilitation. We also provide
    other healthcare-related services. Revenue related to these
    services currently represents less than 1 percent of our
    total net sales. We manage operations through three major
    geographic segments – the Americas, which is comprised
    principally of the United States and includes other North,
    Central and South American markets; Europe, which is
    comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and
    Africa; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan
    and includes other Asian and Pacific markets. This structure is
    the basis for our reportable segment information discussed
    below. Management evaluates operating segment performance based
    upon segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses
    pertaining to global operations and corporate expenses,
    share-based compensation expense, settlement, certain claims,
    acquisition, integration and other expenses, inventory

step-up,

in-process research and development write-offs and intangible
    asset amortization expense. Global operations include research,
    development engineering, medical education, brand management,
    corporate legal, finance, and human resource functions, and
    U.S. and Puerto Rico-based manufacturing operations and
    logistics. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated from
    segment operating profit. Management reviews accounts
    receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, goodwill
    and intangible assets by reportable segment exclusive of U.S and
    Puerto Rico-based manufacturing operations and logistics and
    corporate assets.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES

Intellectual
    Property and Product Liability-Related Litigation

In July 2008, we temporarily suspended marketing and
    distribution of the

Durom

®

Acetabular Component

(Durom

Cup

)

in the
    U.S. to allow us to update product labeling to provide more
    detailed surgical technique instructions to surgeons and
    implement a surgical training program in the U.S. Following
    our announcement, product liability lawsuits and other claims
    have been asserted against us, some of which we have settled.
    There are a number of claims still pending and we expect
    additional claims will be submitted. We recorded a provision of
    $47.5 million in the third quarter of 2008, representing
    management’s estimate of these

Durom

Cup-related
    claims. We increased that provision by $21.5 million in the
    fourth quarter of 2008. The provision is limited to revisions
    within two years of an original surgery that occurred prior to
    July 2008. These parameters are consistent with our data which
    indicates that cup loosenings associated with surgical technique
    are most likely to occur within that time period. Any claims
    received outside of these defined parameters will be managed in
    the normal course and reflected in our standard product
    liability accruals.

On February 15, 2005, Howmedica Osteonics Corp. filed an
    action against us and an unrelated party in the
    United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
    alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934;
    6,372,814; 6,664,308; and 6,818,020. On June 13, 2007, the
    Court granted our motion for summary judgment on the invalidity
    of the asserted claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934;
    6,372,814; and 6,664,308 by ruling that all of the asserted
    claims are invalid for indefiniteness. On August 19, 2008,
    the Court granted our motion for summary judgment of
    non-infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent
    No. 6,818,020, reducing the number of claims at issue in
    the suit to five. We continue to believe that our defenses
    against infringement of the remaining claims are valid and
    meritorious, and we intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

In addition to certain claims related to the

Durom

Cup
    discussed above, we are also subject to product liability and
    other claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of
    business, for which we maintain insurance, subject to
    self-insured retention limits. We establish accruals for product
    liability and other claims in conjunction with outside counsel
    based on current information and historical settlement
    information for open claims, related fees and claims incurred
    but not reported. While it is not possible to predict with
    certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the opinion of
    management that, upon ultimate resolution, liabilities from
    these cases in excess of those recorded, if any, will not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Government
    Investigations

In March 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice through the
    U.S. Attorney’s Office in Newark, New Jersey commenced
    an investigation of us and four other orthopaedic companies
    pertaining to consulting contracts, professional service
    agreements and other agreements by which remuneration is
    provided to orthopaedic surgeons. On September 27, 2007, we
    reached a settlement with the government to resolve all claims
    related to this investigation. As part of the settlement, we
    entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. through
    the U.S. Department of Justice and the Office of Inspector
    General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the
    “OIG-HHS”). In addition, we entered into a Deferred
    Prosecution Agreement (the “DPA”) with the
    U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey
    (the “U.S. Attorney”) and a Corporate Integrity
    Agreement (the “CIA”) with the OIG-HHS. We did not
    admit any wrongdoing, plead guilty to any criminal charges or
    pay any criminal fines as part of the settlement.

We settled all civil and administrative claims related to the
    federal investigation by making a settlement payment to the
    U.S. government of $169.5 million.

Under the terms of the DPA, the U.S. Attorney filed a
    criminal complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
    District of New Jersey charging us with conspiracy to commit
    violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C.

§ 1320a-7b)

during the years 2002 through 2006. The court deferred
    prosecution of the criminal complaint during the

18-month

term of the DPA. The U.S. Attorney will seek dismissal of
    the criminal complaint after the

18-month

period if we comply with the provisions of the DPA. The DPA
    provides for oversight by a federally-appointed monitor.

Under the CIA, which has a term of five years, we agreed, among
    other provisions, to continue the operation of our enhanced
    Corporate Compliance Program, designed to promote compliance
    with federal healthcare program



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements

(Continued)

requirements, in accordance with the terms set forth in the CIA.
    We also agreed to retain an independent review organization
    (“IRO”) to perform annual reviews to assist us in
    assessing our compliance with the obligations set forth in the
    CIA to ensure that arrangements we enter into do not violate the
    Anti-Kickback Statute. Our obligation to retain an IRO is
    suspended during the

18-month

term of the DPA. A material breach of the DPA or the CIA may
    subject us to further criminal or civil action

and/or

to
    exclusion by OIG-HHS from participation in all federal
    healthcare programs, which would have a material adverse effect
    on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In November 2007, we received a civil investigative demand from
    the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office seeking
    additional information regarding the financial relationships we
    publicly disclosed pursuant to the DPA with a number of
    Massachusetts healthcare providers. We received a similar
    inquiry from the Oregon Attorney General’s office in
    October 2008. We are cooperating fully with the investigators
    with regard to these matters.

In September 2007, the Staff of the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission (“SEC”) informed us that it was
    conducting an informal investigation regarding potential
    violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the sale of
    medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in
    the medical device industry. We understand that at least four
    other medical device companies received similar letters. We are
    fully cooperating with the SEC and the U.S. Department of
    Justice with regard to this informal investigation.

Derivative
    Actions and Class Actions

On April 24, 2008, a complaint was filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,
    Thorpe v. Zimmer, Inc., et al., naming us and two of our
    subsidiaries as defendants. The complaint relates to a putative
    class action on behalf of certain residents of New York who had
    hip or knee implant surgery involving Zimmer products during an
    unspecified period. The complaint alleges that our relationships
    with orthopaedic surgeons and others violated the New York
    deceptive practices statute and unjustly enriched us. The
    plaintiff requests actual damages or $50.00, whichever is
    greater, on behalf of each class member, a permanent injunction
    from our engaging in allegedly improper practices in the future
    and restitution in an unspecified amount. We believe this
    lawsuit is without merit, and we intend to defend it vigorously.

On August 5, 2008, a complaint was filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana,
    Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union 719 Pension Fund v.
    Zimmer Holdings, Inc., et al., naming us and two of our
    executive officers as defendants. The complaint relates to a
    putative class action on behalf of persons who purchased our
    common stock between January 29, 2008 and July 22,
    2008. The complaint alleges that we and two of our executive
    officers engaged in violations of federal securities laws by
    allegedly failing to disclose developments relating to our OSP
    manufacturing operations in Dover, Ohio and problems relating to
    the

Durom

Cup. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages
    and interest, attorneys’ fees, costs and other relief. On
    December 24, 2008, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated
    complaint that alleges the same claims and relates to the same
    time period. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
    consolidated complaint on February 23, 2009. The motion to
    dismiss is pending with the court. We believe this lawsuit is
    without merit, and we and the individual defendants intend to
    defend it vigorously.

On August 15, 2008, a shareholder derivative action,
    Hays v. Dvorak et al., was filed in the U.S. District
    Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The plaintiff seeks
    to maintain the action purportedly on our behalf against certain
    of our current and former directors and two

non-director

executive officers. The plaintiff alleges, among other things,
    breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, unjust
    enrichment and gross mismanagement by the named defendants based
    on substantially the same factual allegations as the putative
    federal securities class action referenced above brought by the
    Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union 719 Pension Fund. The
    plaintiff does not seek damages from us, but instead requests
    damages of an unspecified amount on our behalf. The plaintiff
    also seeks equitable relief to remedy the individual
    defendants’ alleged misconduct, attorneys’ fees, costs
    and other relief. The court has entered a scheduling order that
    permits the plaintiff to file an amended complaint on or before
    March 11, 2009. Under that same court order, the defendants
    are not required to respond to any complaint until May 11,
    2009.

On November 20, 2008, a complaint was filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,
    Dewald v. Zimmer Holdings, Inc., et al., naming us and
    certain of our current and former directors and employees as
    defendants. The complaint relates to a putative class action on
    behalf of all persons who were participants in or beneficiaries
    of our U.S. or Puerto Rico Savings and Investment Programs
    (“plans”) between October 5, 2007 and the date of
    filing and whose accounts included investments in our common
    stock. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the
    defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, by
    continuing to offer Zimmer stock as an investment option in the
    plans when the stock purportedly was no longer a prudent
    investment and that defendants failed to provide plan
    participants with complete and accurate information sufficient
    to advise them of the risks of investing their retirement
    savings in Zimmer stock. The plaintiff seeks an unspecified
    monetary payment to the plans, injunctive and equitable relief,
    attorneys’ fees, costs and other relief. On
    January 23, 2009, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint
    that alleges the same claims and clarifies that the class period
    is October 5, 2007 through September 2, 2008. The

defendants are not required to respond to the amended complaint
    until March 23, 2009. We believe this lawsuit is without
    merit, and we and the individual defendants intend to defend it
    vigorously.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures and
    internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable
    assurance that material information relating to us, including
    our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known on a timely basis
    to management and the Board of Directors. However, no control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are
    met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within a company have been detected.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
    of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that
    evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as
    of the end of the period covered by this report are effective.

There was no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred
    during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
    Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting appears in this report at the conclusion of
    Part II, Item 7A.

ITEM 9B.

Other Information

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors was not asked to and did not approve the
    engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent
    registered public accounting firm, to perform any non-audit
    services. This disclosure is made pursuant to
    Section 10A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    as added by Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

We submitted the Annual CEO Certification for 2008 required by
    the New York Stock Exchange to the exchange on June 3, 2008.
