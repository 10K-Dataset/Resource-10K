ANNUAL REPORT

PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

OVERVIEW

We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture
    and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive implants, dental
    implants, spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical
    products. We also provide other healthcare related services. In
    this report, “Zimmer,” “we,” “us,”
    “our” and similar words refer collectively to Zimmer
    Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to
    the parent company only.

Zimmer Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our
    history dates to 1927, when Zimmer Manufacturing Company, a
    predecessor, was founded in Warsaw, Indiana. On August 6,
    2001, Zimmer Holdings was spun off from its former parent and
    became an independent public company.

CUSTOMERS, SALES
    AND MARKETING

Our primary customers include orthopaedic surgeons,
    neurosurgeons, oral surgeons, dentists, hospitals, stocking
    distributors, healthcare dealers and, in their capacity as
    agents, healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups.
    These customers range from large multinational enterprises to
    independent surgeons.

We have operations in more than 25 countries and market products
    in more than 100 countries, with corporate headquarters in
    Warsaw, Indiana, and more than 100 manufacturing, distribution
    and warehousing

and/or

office facilities worldwide. We manage our operations through
    three major geographic segments — the Americas, which
    is comprised principally of the United States and includes other
    North, Central and South American markets; Europe, which is
    comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and
    Africa; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan
    and Australia and includes other Asian and Pacific markets.

We market and sell products through three principal channels:
    1) direct to healthcare institutions, such as hospitals or
    direct channel accounts; 2) through stocking distributors
    and healthcare dealers; and 3) directly to dental practices
    and dental laboratories. With direct channel accounts, inventory
    is generally consigned to sales agents or customers. With sales
    to stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices
    and dental laboratories, title to product passes generally upon
    shipment. Direct channel accounts represented approximately
    80 percent of our net sales in 2009. No individual direct
    channel account, stocking distributor, healthcare dealer, dental
    practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than
    1 percent of our net sales for 2009.

We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title
    to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products
    are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock
    levels are determined based on a number of factors, including
    demand, manufacturing lead times and quantities required to
    maintain service levels. We also carry trade accounts receivable
    balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent
    with local market practices.

We utilize a network of sales associates, sales managers and
    support personnel, most of whom are employed or contracted by
    independent distributors and sales agencies. We invest a
    significant amount of time and expense in training sales
    associates in how to use specific products and how to best
    inform surgeons of product features and uses. Sales force
    representatives must have strong technical selling skills and
    medical education to provide technical support for surgeons.

In response to the different healthcare systems throughout the
    world, our sales and marketing strategies and organizational
    structures differ by region. We utilize a global approach to
    sales force training, marketing and medical education to provide
    consistent, high quality service. Additionally, we keep current
    with key surgical developments and other issues related to
    orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, dentists and oral surgeons
    and the medical procedures they perform.

Americas.

The Americas is our largest
    geographic segment, accounting for $2,372.4 million, or
    58 percent, of 2009 net sales, with the United States
    accounting for 94 percent of net sales in this region. The
    United States sales force primarily consists of independent
    sales agents, most of whom sell products exclusively for Zimmer.
    Sales agents in the United States receive a commission on
    product sales and are responsible for many operating decisions
    and costs. Sales commissions are accrued at the time of sale.

In this region, we contract with group purchasing organizations
    and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by
    offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions
    within a specified group. Generally, we are designated as one of
    several preferred purchasing sources for specified products,
    although members are not obligated to purchase our products.
    Contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a
    term of three years with extensions as warranted.

A majority of hospitals in the United States belong to at least
    one group purchasing organization. In 2009, individual hospital
    orders purchased through contractual arrangements with our two
    largest group purchasing organizations accounted for
    approximately 34 percent of our net sales in the United
    States. Contractual sales were highest through Novation, LLC and
    Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P. No individual end-user,
    however, accounted for over 1 percent of our net sales, and
    the top ten end-users accounted for approximately 4 percent
    of our aggregate net sales in the United States.

In the Americas, we monitor and rank independent sales agents
    across a range of performance metrics including the achievement
    of certain sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of
    working capital.

Europe.

The European geographic segment
    accounted for $1,119.2 million, or 27 percent, of
    2009 net sales, with France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
    Switzerland and the United Kingdom collectively accounting for
    over 75 percent of net sales in the region. This segment
    also includes other key markets, including Benelux, Nordic,
    Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our
    sales force in this region is comprised of direct sales
    associates, commissioned agents, independent distributors and
    sales support personnel. In Europe, we emphasize the advantages
    of our clinically proven, established designs and innovative
    solutions, such as minimally invasive surgical procedures and
    technologies and new and enhanced materials and surfaces.

Asia Pacific.

The Asia Pacific geographic
    segment accounted for $603.8 million, or 15 percent,
    of 2009 net sales, with Japan being the largest market
    within this segment, accounting for approximately
    58 percent of the region’s sales. This segment also
    includes key markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Korea,
    China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and
    Malaysia. In Japan and most countries in the Asia Pacific
    region, we maintain a network of dealers, who act as order
    agents on behalf of hospitals in the region, and sales
    associates, who build and maintain relationships with
    orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons and dental surgeons in their
    markets. These sales associates cover over 7,000 hospitals in
    the region. The knowledge and skills of our sales associates
    play a critical role in providing service, product information
    and support to surgeons.

SEASONALITY

Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, as many of our
    products are used in elective procedures, which typically
    decline during the summer months and holiday seasons.

DISTRIBUTION

We operate distribution facilities domestically in Warsaw,
    Indiana; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina; Memphis,
    Tennessee; Carlsbad, California; and Austin, Texas and
    internationally, in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the
    Czech Republic, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong,
    India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New
    Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain,
    Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom. In
    2009, we completed construction of our highly automated,

state-of-the-art

distribution facility in Eschbach, Germany. This new facility
    supports direct to customer, country and dealer shipments for
    the European region and global shipments for products sourced
    from certain European-based supply chain sites.

We generally ship our orders via expedited courier. We do not
    consider our backlog of firm orders to be material to an
    understanding of our business.

PRODUCTS

Our products include orthopaedic reconstructive implants, dental
    implants, spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical
    products.

We utilize our exclusive

Trabecular
    Metal

tm

Technology across various product categories.

Trabecular
    Metal

material is a structural biomaterial with a cellular
    architecture that resembles bone and approximates its physical
    and mechanical properties more closely than other prosthetic
    materials. The highly porous trabecular configuration is
    conducive to more normal bone formation and bone in-growth.

Trabecular Metal

implants are fabricated using elemental
    tantalum metal and a patented vapor deposition technique that
    creates a metallic strut configuration resembling cancellous
    bone with nano-textured surface features.

Orthopaedic
    Reconstructive Implants

Knee
    Implants

Total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral
    component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an articular
    surface (placed on the tibial tray). Knee replacement surgeries
    include first-time, or primary, joint replacement procedures and
    revision procedures for the replacement, repair or enhancement
    of an implant or component from a previous procedure. Knee
    implants are designed to accommodate different levels of
    ligament stabilization of the joint. While some knee implant
    designs, called cruciate retaining (CR) designs, require the
    retention of the posterior cruciate ligament, other designs,
    called posterior stabilized (PS) and ultracongruent (UC)
    designs, provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate
    ligament. There are also procedures for partial reconstruction
    of the knee, which treat limited knee degeneration and involve
    the replacement of only one side, or compartment, of the knee
    with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis.

Our portfolio of

Minimally Invasive
    Solutions

tm

Procedures (MIS) includes the MIS Mini-Incision Total Knee
    Procedure. The MIS Mini-Incision Procedure utilizes specialized
    MIS Instruments which feature smaller, ergonomic and highly
    precise instruments which accommodate and facilitate a smaller
    incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft tissues.

We offer a wide range of products for specialized knee
    procedures, including the following:

NexGen

®

Complete Knee Solution.  The number one selling knee
    brand in the world, the

NexGen

Knee product line is a
    comprehensive system for knee replacement surgery which has
    significant application across the continuum of care in all
    things related to primary and revision knee arthroplasty,
    including CR, PS and revision procedures. The

NexGen

Knee
    System offers joint stability, sizing and performance options
    that can be tailored to individual patient needs while providing
    surgeons with a unified system of interchangeable components.

philosophies, including soft tissue balancing and measured
    resection MIS Mini-Incision Instruments, and multiple
    traditional instrument systems. The breadth and versatility of
    the

NexGen

Knee System allows surgeons to transition from
    one type of implant to another during surgery, according to the
    respective needs of the patient, and to support current surgical
    philosophies.

The

NexGen

CR product line is designed to be used in
    conjunction with a functioning posterior cruciate ligament.
    Similar to the posterior stabilized design, the

NexGen

CR-Flex

Fixed Bearing Knee is designed to provide a greater range of
    motion for patients who require deep bending in their activities
    of daily living. The

NexGen

CR-Flex Femoral Components
    offer a tissue balancing (flexion balancing) solution which
    allows the surgeon to adjust component sizing and balance and
    stabilize the implant without removing additional bone or
    wasting critical procedure time.

The

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution

Legacy

®

Knee-Posterior Stabilized product line provides stability in the
    absence of the posterior cruciate ligament. The PS capabilities
    can be augmented via the use of a

NexGen Legacy

Posterior
    Stabilized Flex Knee (LPS-Flex Knee), a high-flexion implant
    that has the potential to accommodate knee flexion up to

155-degrees

range of motion for patients whose lifestyle and body type
    demand and can accommodate this performance standard. With the
    2008 rollout of the

NexGen

LPS-Flex Mobile Knee in the
    U.S., we are now one of only two companies that can offer a
    mobile-bearing total knee treatment option in the
    U.S. market for surgeons and patients that may be best
    suited for this high performance implant design.

NexGen

Knee

Gender
    Solutions

tm

femorals represent the first knee implants specifically shaped
    to offer fit and function optimized for the unique anatomical
    considerations more commonly seen in female patients. Gender
    implants are an important strategic focus, as more than half of
    total knee arthroplasty patients are female.

Gender Solutions

femorals are available in both

NexGen

CR-Flex

and LPS-Flex configurations. The concept of advancing implant
    design through customization based on anatomy or other patient
    characteristics has manifested in rapidly expanding gender
    technologies across the continuum of our products and into other
    important brands in our growing portfolio.

The

NexGen

Revision Knee product line consists of several
    different products that are designed to provide clinical
    solutions to surgeons for various revision situations, including
    multiple constraint levels for ligament and soft tissue
    inefficiencies and a bone augmentation implant system made from
    our

Trabecular Metal

Technology material. These augments
    are designed to address significant bone loss in revision
    surgery while allowing natural bone to reconstruct within the
    implant construct.

We offer improved polyethylene performance in the

NexGen

Knee System with our conventional polyethylene and

Prolong

®

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene, which offers reduced wear
    and resistance to oxidation, pitting and cracking.

    in total knee arthroplasty (female and male) and offers two
    distinct implant shapes for enhanced fit. The system is
    compatible with muscle sparing MIS procedures and accommodates
    high flexion capacity up to 155 degrees. The system features the
    proven clinical success of our asymmetric tibial plate,

CSTi

porous coating,

Prolong

Highly Crosslinked
    Polyethylene and the ultracongruent articular surface.

Innex

®

Total Knee System.  The

Innex

Knee System
    offers fixed bearing and mobile bearing knee components all
    designed within the same system philosophy. While the

Innex

Knee System is best known for its mobile bearing knee
    offering, the availability of differing levels of articular
    constraint, the

Innex

Revision Knee and

Innex Gender
    Solutions

components make this offering a comprehensive
    mobile and fixed bearing knee system. The

Innex

Knee
    System is distributed in Europe and Asia Pacific and is not
    currently available for commercial distribution in the United
    States.

Zimmer

Unicompartmental Knee Systems.  The

Zimmer

®

Unicompartmental Knee System offers a high flexion design
    for unicompartmental knee surgery. This high flex product was
    designed specifically for MIS Procedures and Technologies. The
    system offers the surgeon the ability to conserve bone by
    replacing only the compartment of the knee that has had
    degenerative changes. A

Gender Solutions

Patello-Femoral
    Joint System is also available which incorporates key gender
    specific design features and a proprietary guided milling
    surgical technique for use in patello-femoral joint replacement.

Zimmer

Patient Specific Instruments.  In late
    2009, a 510(k) Application for the

Zimmer

Patient
    Specific Instruments was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA). The

Zimmer

Patient Specific
    Instruments simplify a total knee procedure and help enhance
    appropriate placement of the final implant based on a
    surgeon’s preoperative surgical plan. Based on a
    patient’s MRI scan, a computer generated, custom guide is
    produced to conform to a patient’s unique knee anatomy.
    This guide is then utilized intraoperatively to aid in the
    surgical correction of the patient’s knee.

    expanding our product solutions across the continuum of care
    and, with the incorporation of

Trabecular Metal

Technology, expands the possibilities for treatment, short
    and long term fixation and stability.

Hip
    Implants

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the
    femur and the socket portion of the pelvis (acetabulum) of the
    natural hip. Hip procedures include first time, or primary,
    joint replacement as well as revision procedures. Approximately
    30 percent of hip implant procedures involve the use of
    bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the
    surrounding bone. The remaining are press-fit into bone, which
    means that they have a surface that bone affixes to through
    either ongrowth or ingrowth technologies.

Our portfolio of MIS Techniques includes the

Zimmer

MIS
    Anterior Supine Technique, the MIS Posterior Procedure, the

Zimmer

MIS Anterolateral Technique and MIS

2-Incision

tm

Hip Replacement Procedure. The MIS Techniques are designed to be
    less invasive to soft tissues and to shorten recovery time.

Our key hip replacement products include:

Zimmer

M/L Taper Hip Prosthesis with

Kinectiv

®

Technology. The

Zimmer

M/L Taper Hip Prosthesis
    offers a proximally porous-coated wedge-shaped design based on
    long term clinically proven concepts. The M/L Taper has become
    widely used in MIS Procedures due to several key design
    features. The

Zimmer

M/L Taper Hip Prosthesis with

Kinectiv

Technology is a system of modular stem and neck
    components designed to help the surgeon restore the natural hip
    joint center intraoperatively by addressing the key variables of
    leg length, offset and version independently.

    and collaboration of the physicians and the hospital-based
    departments with the goal of consistently producing a superior
    outcome in the form of a growing, efficient, and effective care
    delivery network. Currently, revenue related to Accelero
    represents less than 1 percent of our total net sales.

ORTHOBIOLOGICS

Our research and development efforts include an Orthobiologics
    group based in Austin, Texas, with its own full-time staff and
    dedicated projects centralizing on the development of a variety
    of biologic technologies for musculoskeletal applications. This
    group works on biological solutions to repair and regenerate
    damaged or degenerated musculoskeletal tissues using
    biomaterials/cell therapies which offer the possibility of
    treating damaged joints by biological repair rather than
    replacing them. A sampling of some of our key projects in the
    Orthobiologics area is set forth below.

We are collaborating with ISTO Technologies, Inc. (ISTO) to
    develop chondral and osteochondral grafts for cartilage repair.
    ISTO creates cell-based therapies for cartilage regeneration
    using cells from juvenile donor cartilage. DeNovo ET Engineered
    Tissue Graft is a living tissue-engineered cartilage graft under
    clinical investigation for the restoration of cartilage defects,
    reestablishment of joint function and relief of pain in the
    knee. The Phase I/II clinical trial for DeNovo ET has been
    completed and the data has been supplied to the FDA with a
    request to allow Zimmer/ISTO to proceed with enrollment with the
    pivotal Phase III clinical trial. In addition, we completed
    the full launch of our first cartilage repair product, DeNovo NT
    Natural Tissue Graft, in 2009. This product provides
    particulated juvenile cartilage tissue for repair of articular
    cartilage defects of the knee, ankle, shoulder, hip, elbow and
    toe joints. More than 700 patients have undergone this
    innovative cartilage repair procedure.

Many musculoskeletal surgical procedures use bone grafts to help
    regenerate lost or damaged bone. Our Spine, Dental and Trauma
    divisions have introduced a technologically advanced all-human
    demineralized bone matrix,

Puros

DBM Putty and Putty with
    bone chips. This bone-derived allograft material is used to fill
    bone voids or defects. It is placed into the bone void where it
    is then completely replaced by natural bone during the healing
    process.

RESEARCH AND
    DEVELOPMENT

We have extensive research and development activities to develop
    new surgical techniques, materials, orthobiologics and product
    designs. The research and development functions work closely
    with our strategic brand marketing function. The rapid
    commercialization of innovative new materials, orthobiologics
    products, implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques
    remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an
    important driver of sales growth.

We are broadening our product offerings in each of the product
    categories and exploring new technologies with possible
    applications in multiple areas. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we spent
    $205.4 million, $192.3 million and
    $182.6 million, respectively, on research and development.
    Our primary research and development facility is located in
    Warsaw, Indiana. We have other research and development
    personnel based in, among other places, Winterthur, Switzerland;
    Austin, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Carlsbad, California;
    Dover, Ohio; and Parsippany, New Jersey. As of December 31,
    2009, we employed more than 800 research and development
    employees worldwide.

We expect to continue to identify innovative technologies and
    consider acquiring complementary products or businesses, or
    establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic
    alliances.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE

We are subject to government regulation in the countries in
    which we conduct business. In the U.S., numerous laws and
    regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices
    are brought to market. These include, among others, the Federal
    Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations issued or
    promulgated thereunder. The FDA has enacted regulations that
    control all aspects of the development, manufacture,
    advertising, promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical
    products, including medical devices. In addition, the FDA
    controls the access of products to market through processes
    designed to ensure that only products that are safe and
    effective are made available to the public.

Most of our new products fall into FDA classifications that
    require the submission of a Premarket Notification (510(k)) to
    the FDA. This process requires us to demonstrate that the device
    to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is,
    substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device. We must
    submit information that supports our substantial equivalency
    claims. Before we can market the new device, we must receive an
    order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence and clearing
    the new device for commercial distribution in the United States.
    Other devices we develop and market are in a category (class)
    for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical
    investigation and Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. The PMA
    process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that
    establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective.
    The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution
    if it determines that the data and information in the PMA
    constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is
    reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for
    its intended use(s). All of our devices marketed in the United
    States have been cleared or approved by the FDA, with the
    exception of certain

pre-amendment

devices which were in commercial distribution prior to
    May 28, 1976. The FDA has grandfathered these devices, so
    new FDA submissions are not required. The FDA has the authority
    to: halt the distribution of certain medical devices; detain or
    seize adulterated or



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

misbranded medical devices; or order the repair, replacement or
    refund of the costs of such devices. There are also certain
    requirements of state, local and foreign governments that we
    must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our
    products.

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our
    products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among
    other things, design and product standards, packaging
    requirements and labeling requirements. Many of the regulations
    applicable to our devices and products in these countries are
    similar to those of the FDA. The member countries of the
    European Union have adopted the European Medical Device
    Directive, which creates a single set of medical device
    regulations for products marketed in all member countries.
    Compliance with the Medical Device Directive and certification
    to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a CE mark
    on its products. To obtain authorization to affix the CE mark to
    a product, a recognized European Notified Body must assess a
    manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s
    conformity to the requirements of the Medical Device Directive.
    We are subject to inspection by the Notified Bodies for
    compliance with these requirements.

Further, we are subject to various federal and state laws
    concerning healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims
    laws and anti-kickback laws. These laws are administered by,
    among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of
    Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
    and state attorneys general. Many of these agencies have
    increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical
    device manufacturers in recent years. Violations of these laws
    are punishable by criminal

and/or

civil
    sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment
    and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in
    government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and
    Veterans Administration (VA) health programs.

Our operations in foreign countries are subject to the
    extraterritorial application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act (FCPA). As part of our global compliance program,
    we seek to address FCPA risks proactively.

Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex
    federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational
    safety laws and regulations, including those relating to
    discharges of substances in the air, water and land, the
    handling, storage and disposal of wastes and the

clean-up

of
    properties by pollutants. We do not expect that the ongoing
    costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will
    have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital
    expenditures or competitive position.

COMPETITION

The orthopaedics industry is highly competitive. In the global
    markets for reconstructive implants, trauma and related surgical
    products, our major competitors include: DePuy Orthopaedics,
    Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Stryker
    Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Smith & Nephew plc, Wright
    Medical Group, Inc., Synthes, Inc. and Tornier, Inc.

In the Americas geographic segment, we and DePuy Orthopaedics,
    Inc., Stryker Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Smith &
    Nephew, Inc. (a subsidiary of Smith & Nephew plc),
    Wright Medical Group, Inc. and Synthes, Inc. account for a large
    majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales.

In the Asia Pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma
    products, we compete primarily with DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.,
    Stryker Corporation, Synthes, Inc. and Smith & Nephew
    plc, as well as regional companies, including Japan Medical
    Materials Corporation and Japan Medical Dynamic Marketing, Inc.
    Factors, such as the dealer system and complex regulatory
    environments, make it difficult for smaller companies,
    particularly those that are non-regional, to compete effectively
    with the market leaders in the Asia Pacific region.

The European reconstructive implant and trauma product markets
    are more fragmented than the Americas or the Asia Pacific
    segments. The variety of philosophies held by European surgeons
    regarding hip reconstruction, for example, has fostered the
    existence of many regional European companies, including
    Aesculap AG (a subsidiary of B. Braun), Waldemar LINK
    GmbH & Co., KG and Mathys AG which, in addition to the
    global competitors, compete with us. Today most hip implants
    sold in Europe are products developed specifically for the
    European market, although global products are gaining
    acceptance. We will continue to develop and produce specially
    tailored products to meet specific European needs.

In the spinal implant category, we compete globally primarily
    with the spinal and biologic business of Medtronic, Inc., DePuy
    Spine (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Synthes,
    Inc., Stryker Corporation, Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine
    (subsidiaries of Biomet, Inc.) and NuVasive, Inc.

In the dental implant category, we compete primarily with Nobel
    Biocare Holding AG, Straumann Holding AG, Astra Tech Dental and
    Biomet 3i (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.).

Competition within the industry is primarily based on
    technology, innovation, quality, reputation and customer
    service. A key factor in our continuing success in the future
    will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing
    products and technologies.

MANUFACTURING AND
    RAW MATERIALS

We manufacture substantially all of our products at nine sites
    including Warsaw, Indiana; Winterthur, Switzerland; Ponce,
    Puerto Rico; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina; Carlsbad,
    California; Parsippany, New Jersey; Shannon, Ireland; and
    Etupes, France.

We believe that our manufacturing facilities are among the best
    in our industry in terms of automation and productivity and have
    the flexibility to accommodate future growth. The manufacturing
    operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the
    cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a
    manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous operational
    improvement and optimization. Our continuous improvement efforts
    are driven by Lean and Six Sigma methodologies. In addition, at
    certain

of our manufacturing facilities, many of the employees are
    cross-trained to perform a broad array of operations.

We generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at
    levels up to 90 percent of total capacity. We continually
    evaluate the potential to in-source products currently purchased
    from outside vendors to

on-site

production.

We have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our
    profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs. We
    have, for example, employed computer-assisted robots and
    multi-axis grinders to precision polish medical devices;
    automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes,
    including on-machine inspection and process controls; purchased

state-of-the-art

equipment; in-sourced core products, such as castings and
    forgings; and negotiated reductions in third party supplier
    costs.

We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the
    manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw
    materials and select components used in manufacturing our
    products from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase some
    supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance,
    sole source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints
    resulting from regulatory requirements. We work closely with our
    suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high
    quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any
    significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials
    necessary to fulfill our production schedules.

INTELLECTUAL
    PROPERTY

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the
    continued success of our business. We also rely upon trade
    secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and
    licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive
    position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of
    methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary
    information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and
    others who may have access to proprietary information. We own or
    control through licensing arrangements more than 4,000 issued
    patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate
    to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our
    products.

EMPLOYEES

We employ more than 8,200 employees worldwide, including
    more than 800 employees dedicated to research and
    development. Approximately 4,900 employees are located
    within the United States and approximately 3,300 employees
    are located outside of the United States, primarily throughout
    Europe and in Japan. We have over 3,500 employees dedicated
    to manufacturing our products worldwide. The Warsaw, Indiana
    production facility employs more than 1,600 employees.
    Fewer than 200 North American employees are members of a trade
    union covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

We have a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steel,
    Paper and Forestry, Rubber Manufacturing, Energy, Allied
    Industrial and Service Workers International Union for and on
    behalf of Local

2737-15

covering employees at the Dover, Ohio facility, which continues
    in effect until May 15, 2012.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from
    our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial
    condition and results of operations are discussed below and
    elsewhere in this report. The risks and uncertainties described
    below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently
    not believed to be significant to our business may also affect
    our actual results and could harm our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or
    uncertainties described below or any additional risks and
    uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.

ANNUAL REPORT

operations and financial condition could be materially and
    adversely affected.

RISKS RELATED TO
    OUR BUSINESS

If we fail to comply with the terms of the Corporate
    Integrity Agreement we entered into in September 2007, we may be
    subject to exclusion from federal healthcare programs.

As previously reported, in September 2007 we settled an
    investigation conducted by the United States Attorney’s
    Office for the District of New Jersey (U.S. Attorney) into
    financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers
    and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. As part of that settlement,
    we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the
    Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and
    Human Services (OIG-HHS). A copy of the CIA is filed as an
    exhibit to this report. If we do not comply with the terms of
    the CIA, we could be subject to exclusion by OIG-HHS from
    participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicaid
    and Medicare.

We could be subject to further governmental investigations or
    actions by other third parties based on allegations of
    wrongdoing similar to those made by the U.S. Attorney.

Our settlement with the U.S. government does not preclude
    other governmental agencies or state authorities from conducting
    investigations or instituting proceedings based on allegations
    of wrongdoing similar to those made by the U.S. Attorney.
    As previously disclosed, we are cooperating with the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the
    U.S. Department of Justice with regard to an ongoing
    investigation into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act in the sale of medical devices in a number of
    foreign countries by companies in the medical device industry.
    We are also cooperating with investigative demands made by two
    state attorneys general. While we believe that the pending state
    investigations are not likely to have a material adverse effect
    on our business or financial condition, similar investigations
    by other states or governmental agencies are possible. We cannot
    assure that the costs of defending or resolving those
    investigations or proceedings would not have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows.

Our temporary suspension of the U.S. marketing and
    distribution of one of our hip products has adversely affected
    sales growth, resulted in claims and may adversely affect our
    ability to compete in the hip resurfacing market in the U.S.

As previously reported, we temporarily suspended the marketing
    and distribution of our

Durom

Acetabular Component
    (

Durom

Cup) in the U.S. in July 2008. Although we
    resumed U.S. marketing and distribution in August 2008, we
    believe the effects of this action had a negative impact on our
    hip product sales growth through 2009 and may continue to have a
    negative impact in 2010.

Following our action, product liability lawsuits and other
    claims were asserted against us and additional similar claims
    may be asserted. In addition, our entry into the U.S. hip
    resurfacing market has been delayed as the

Durom

Cup had
    been integral to our plans for entry into that market.

If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors
    upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may
    not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may
    decline.

Our marketing success in the United States and abroad depends
    significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales
    and service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents
    have developed professional relationships with existing and
    potential customers because of the agents’ detailed
    knowledge of products and instruments. A loss of a significant
    number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on
    our business and results of operations.

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our
    products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy
    our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we
    may not anticipate because of:

•

evolving customer needs;

•

changing demographics;

•

slowing industry growth rates;

•

declines in the reconstructive implant market;

•

the introduction of new products and technologies;

•

evolving surgical philosophies; and

•

evolving industry standards.

Without the timely introduction of new products and
    enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If
    that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer.
    The success of our new product offerings will depend on several
    factors, including our ability to:

•

properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

•

commercialize new products in a timely manner;

•

manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient
    volumes on time;

•

differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings;

•

achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

•

satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers
    and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative
    recovery and lower-cost procedures;

•

innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical
    techniques; and

•

provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical
    techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some
    or all markets, because of, among other factors:

•

entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

•

the need for regulatory clearance; and

•

uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment
    in research and development before we can determine their
    commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources
    necessary to fund the production. In addition, even if we are
    able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of
    our products, these



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

enhancements or new generations of products may not produce
    revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be
    quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or
    the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new
    technologies or features.

We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside
    of the United States, which subjects us to additional business
    risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to
    increased costs.

We sell our products in more than 100 countries and derive more
    than 40 percent of our net sales from outside the United
    States. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in
    sales internationally, which could expose us to additional risks
    associated with international sales and operations. Our
    international operations are, and will continue to be, subject
    to a number of risks and potential costs, including:

•

changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

•

unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;

•

differing local product preferences and product requirements;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries
    outside of the United States;

•

trade protection measures and import or export requirements that
    may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and
    may increase our operating costs;

•

foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from
    repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United States;

•

complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

•

extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

labor force instability;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax
    laws; and

•

political and economic instability.

Violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines,
    criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees,
    prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our
    reputation.

We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate
    fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our
    profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.

A substantial portion of our foreign revenues are generated in
    Europe and Japan. The United States dollar value of our
    foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate
    fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the United
    States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese Yen, as well
    as other currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations. Although we address currency risk
    management through regular operating and financing activities,
    and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial
    instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.

We may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology
    and other intellectual property, which would allow competitors
    or others to take advantage of our research and development
    efforts.

Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market
    technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or
    maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not
    be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary
    technologies. Also, our currently pending or future patent
    applications may not result in issued patents, and issued
    patents are subject to claims concerning priority, scope and
    other issues.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office and the courts
    have not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or
    interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and
    biotechnology patents. Future changes in, or unexpected
    interpretations of, the patent laws may adversely affect our
    ability to enforce our patent position.

In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or
    of limited effect in some foreign countries. If we do not obtain
    sufficient international protection for our intellectual
    property, our competitiveness in international markets could be
    impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue.

We also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary
    know-how and continuing technological innovation with security
    measures, including the use of confidentiality agreements with
    our employees, consultants and collaborators. These measures may
    prove to be ineffective and any remedies available to us may be
    insufficient to compensate our damages.

We may be subject to intellectual property litigation and
    infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant
    expenses or prevent us from selling our products.

A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property
    infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and
    profitability, in some cases materially. From time to time, we
    receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and
    receive claims of potential infringement. We may be unaware of
    intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of
    our technology. If someone claims that our products infringed
    their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation
    could be costly and time consuming and would divert the
    attention of management and key personnel from other business
    issues. If we were to lose such litigation involving material
    intellectual property rights, we may be unable to manufacture,
    sell or use some of our products.

We may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic
    alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be
    disruptive.

We intend to continue to look for additional strategic
    acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our
    businesses and other companies with whom we could form strategic
    alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit
    intellectual property rights. These activities involve risks,
    including the following:

•

we may need to divert more management resources to integration
    than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to
    pursue other more profitable activities;



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

•

the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses may be
    increased if we need to integrate geographically separated
    organizations, personnel with disparate business backgrounds and
    companies with different corporate cultures;

•

we may not recognize expected cost savings or the anticipated
    benefits of acquisitions or strategic alliances;

•

our acquisition candidates or strategic partners may have
    unexpected liabilities or prove unable to meet their obligations
    to us or the joint venture; and

•

the priorities of our strategic partners may prove incompatible
    with ours.

We depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw
    materials and outsourced activities.

We use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to
    manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing
    activities. These suppliers must provide the materials and
    perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our
    quality and regulatory requirements. Some key raw materials and
    outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source
    or a limited number of sources. A prolonged disruption or other
    inability to obtain these materials or outsource key
    manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect
    our ability to satisfy demand for our products.

We are subject to putative stockholder class action lawsuits
    that could be costly to defend and distracting to management.

We and a number of our related parties are defending putative
    stockholder class action lawsuits alleging violations of the
    securities laws or violations of the federal Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act of 1974 arising out of trading or ownership
    of our common stock. We believe these lawsuits are without
    merit, and we intend to defend them vigorously. We may incur
    significant expenses associated with the defense of these
    lawsuits, however, and the necessary participation of our
    executive officers could detract from their ability to devote
    their full time and attention to our business operations.

RISKS RELATED TO
    OUR INDUSTRY

The ongoing investigation by the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice
    regarding potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
    Act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign
    countries by companies in the medical device industry could have
    a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
    and cash flows.

We are cooperating fully with the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice with
    regard to an ongoing investigation of potential violations of
    the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the sale of medical devices
    in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical
    device industry. Although we have adopted policies and
    procedures designed to prevent improper payments and we train
    our employees, distributors and others concerning these issues,
    we cannot assure that violations of these requirements will not
    occur. If we are found to have violated the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act, we may face sanctions including fines, criminal
    penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment
    of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive
    export licenses.

The impact of healthcare reform in the U.S. on us is
    uncertain.

There is increasing emphasis within the federal government to
    reform healthcare in the U.S., though it is uncertain whether
    new legislation will be enacted. To the extent that the number
    of uninsured or underinsured patients is reduced, demand for our
    products could marginally increase. However, efforts to pay for
    healthcare reform through a proposed new tax on medical device
    companies and efforts to contain healthcare costs, directly
    through pricing or reimbursement controls or indirectly by
    government-sponsored healthcare insurance, could have a material
    adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
    Accordingly, the impact of healthcare reform on the medical
    device industry in general or us in particular remains uncertain.

We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on
    an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business
    practices and restrict our operations in the future.

Our industry is subject to various federal and state laws
    pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims
    laws, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, similar state laws and
    physician self-referral laws. Violations of these laws are
    punishable by criminal

and/or

civil
    sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment
    and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in
    government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and
    Veterans Administration (VA) health programs. The interpretation
    and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and
    subject to rapid change.

If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for
    our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our
    products may decline and our ability to sell our products
    profitably may be harmed.

We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors,
    dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which receive
    reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their
    patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and
    international government programs, private insurance plans and
    managed care programs. These third-party payors may deny
    reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a
    procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment
    methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for
    an unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline to
    reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. If our
    products are not considered cost-effective by third-party
    payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for our products.

In addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to
    contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level
    of reimbursement for medical products and services. If
    third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and
    other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our
    products may decline, or we may experience pressure to



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

We have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing
    and other effects of healthcare reform in our international
    markets. If key participants in government healthcare systems
    reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and
    results of operations may be adversely affected.

The ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing
    organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations.

Many customers for our products have formed group purchasing
    organizations in an effort to contain costs. Group purchasing
    organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply
    manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are
    made available to a group purchasing organization’s
    affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the
    providers selected by a group purchasing organization,
    affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to
    purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization
    has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another
    manufacturer’s products, we may be precluded from making
    sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the
    duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to respond
    to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing
    organizations may cause us to lose market share to our
    competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our
    sales and results of operations.

Our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and
    market our products against those of our competitors.

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our present or
    future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by
    technological advances by one or more of our present or future
    competitors or by other therapies, including biological
    therapies. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop
    and acquire new products and technologies. Competition is
    primarily on the basis of:

•

technology;

•

innovation;

•

quality;

•

reputation; and

•

customer service.

In markets outside of the United States, other factors influence
    competition as well, including:

•

local distribution systems;

•

complex regulatory environments; and

•

differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

Our competitors may:

•

have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

•

respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

•

undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

•

adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

•

be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees
    and strategic partners.

Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to
    have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.

We and our customers are subject to various governmental
    regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and
    marketing of our products, and we may incur significant expenses
    to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible
    with these regulations.

The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market
    are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other
    federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process
    of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can
    be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted
    for future products on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in
    receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products
    could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in
    substantial additional costs.

In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable material
    regulatory requirements, including, for example, the Quality
    System Regulation, recordkeeping regulations, labeling
    requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, we may be
    subject to a range of sanctions including:

•

warning letters;

•

fines or civil penalties;

•

injunctions;

•

repairs, replacements or refunds;

•

recalls or seizures of products;

•

total or partial suspension of production;

•

the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or
    approvals;

•

withdrawals or suspensions of current product
    applications; and

•

criminal prosecution.

Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules
    of industrial standards bodies, such as the International
    Standards Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of
    these regulations, our business will be harmed.

We may incur product liability losses, and insurance coverage
    may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.

In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of
    product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures,
    manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of
    product-related risks or product-related information resulted in
    an unsafe condition or injury to patients. Product liability
    lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls,
    regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material
    adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability
    to attract and retain customers.

Although we maintain third-party product liability insurance
    coverage, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the
    coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record
    a self-insured loss. Even if any product liability loss is
    covered by an insurance policy, these policies typically have
    substantial retentions or deductibles that we are responsible
    for. Product liability claims in excess of applicable

During 2009 we commenced manufacturing operations in our new
    125,000 square feet Shannon, Ireland facility and began
    utilizing our new 94,000 square feet warehouse facility in
    Eschbach, Germany in an effort to expand our global distribution
    network. We believe the current facilities, including
    manufacturing, warehousing, research and development and office
    space provide sufficient capacity to meet ongoing demands. Once
    a facility reaches 85 percent utilization, we examine
    alternatives for either expanding that facility or acquiring new
    facilities to meet our ongoing demands.

In addition to the above, we maintain more than 100 other
    offices and warehouse facilities in more than 25 countries
    around the world, including the United States, Japan, Australia,
    France, Russia, India, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and China. We
    believe that all of the facilities and equipment are in good
    condition, well maintained and able to operate at present levels.

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
    conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
    corresponding notes included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW

We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture
    and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive implants, dental
    implants, spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical
    products (sometimes referred to in this report as OSP). We also
    provide other healthcare related services. We have operations in
    more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100
    countries. We manage operations through three reportable
    geographic segments — the Americas, Europe and Asia
    Pacific.

Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis
    are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and
    therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for
    disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2008 and 2007
    consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
    conform to the 2009 presentation.

Beginning in 2009, we no longer include our Dental product
    category sales within our Reconstructive products category.
    Amounts in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007
    related to sales of Dental products have been reclassified to
    conform to the 2009 presentation.

We believe the following developments or trends are important in
    understanding our financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Demand (Volume
    and Mix) Trends

Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales
    contributed 2 percentage points of 2009 sales growth, which
    is 1 percentage point below the rate of growth from 2008
    compared to 2007.

We believe the market for orthopaedic procedure volume
    temporarily decelerated from mid single digit growth rates to
    low single digit growth rates on a global basis due to the
    weakened global economy. We believe long-term market growth
    rates will be driven by an aging global population, obesity,
    proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in
    surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other
    factors. In addition, the ongoing shift in demand to premium
    products, such as

Longevity

and

Prolong

Highly
    Crosslinked Polyethylenes,

Trabecular Metal

Technology
    products, hip stems with

Kinectiv

Technology, high-flex
    knees, knee revision products, porous hip stems and the
    introduction of patient specific devices continues to positively
    affect sales growth. Our 2 percentage points of sales
    growth in 2009 from volume and changes in mix decreased from
    2008 and was lower than market growth due to the impact of the
    disruptive events discussed below.

Pricing
    Trends

Global selling prices decreased 1 percent during 2009
    compared to flat pricing in 2008. Selling prices in the Americas
    decreased 1 percent during the year ended December 31,
    2009, compared to flat pricing in the same 2008 period. Europe
    selling prices were flat for the year ended December 31,
    2009, which is similar to the 2008 period. Asia Pacific selling
    prices decreased 1 percent for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared to a 3 percent decrease in
    the same 2008 period, as we anniversaried out of scheduled
    reductions in reimbursement prices in Japan. With the effect of
    governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and continuing
    pressure from local hospitals and health systems, we expect
    selling prices to decrease approximately 1 to 2 percent on
    a global basis for 2010.

Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rates

For 2009, foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a
    2 percent decline in sales. If foreign currency exchange
    rates remain consistent with 2009 year end rates, we
    estimate that a weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange
    rates will have a positive effect in 2010 of approximately
    1 percent on sales. We address currency risk through
    regular operating and financing activities, and, under
    appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization,
    through the use of forward contracts and options solely for
    managing foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to
    foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to
    offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which
    are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net
    earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal.

Disruptive Events

We suffered customer losses as a result of disruptive factors
    experienced during 2008, including the implementation of our
    enhanced global compliance initiatives, our temporary suspension
    of U.S. marketing and distribution of the

Durom

Cup
    and our voluntary recall and suspension of production of certain
    OSP patient care products. We estimate that these customer
    losses reduced our global knee market share by approximately
    1.5 percent and hip market share by approximately
    2 percent on a cumulative basis through the end of 2008.
    These share losses affected sales growth in 2009, especially in
    the first six to nine months of the year, but stabilized as we
    concluded the year.

Global Economic
    Conditions

We believe adverse conditions in the broader economy have
    resulted in a slowdown in elective hospital procedures. We saw
    evidence of recovery in 2009, although the large developed
    countries in Europe appear to be lagging the U.S. and
    Japan. Although many of our products are used in elective
    procedures, we believe our core knee and hip franchises remain
    more insulated than many medical product categories from swings
    in the broader economy because the need for these procedures
    does not diminish, even if the

    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

timing is affected. In particular, our dental revenues have
    experienced pressure due to the weak economic environment as
    many of those procedures are not reimbursed by third-party
    payors.

2010 Outlook

In the second half of 2009, we saw encouraging signs that
    orthopaedic procedure volumes in certain markets were
    recovering. Our market assumptions are that in 2010 knee and hip
    procedures will grow in mid single digits within the Americas
    and Asia Pacific markets, and remain flat to slightly positive
    in the large developed markets in Europe. Given the expected
    pacing of our new product launches, such as the

Zimmer MMC

Cup,

Continuum

Acetabular System and

Zimmer

Patient Specific Instruments, we anticipate our sales growth
    in 2010 to be greater in the second half of the year.

We expect to continue making investments in R&D in the
    range of 5 to 6 percent of sales. Assuming currency rates
    remain at year end 2009 levels, we expect our gross margin to be
    approximately 75 percent of sales in 2010. This takes into
    account the higher cost inventory we carry into 2010 as well as
    projected foreign currency hedge losses partially offset by
    lower anticipated excess and obsolete inventory charges in 2010.
    We expect the gross margin ratio to be slightly lower in the
    first half of 2010 as compared to the second half of the year.
    SG&A as a percent of sales is expected to decrease for the
    full year as we restore leverage from revenue growth offset, in
    part, by sales and marketing investments in support of new
    product launches. We have completed the infrastructure
    investment projects in Eschbach, Germany, our automated,
    centralized distribution facility for the Europe, Middle East
    and Africa region, and in Shannon, Ireland, our new implant
    manufacturing facility. Both facilities are now operational and
    should provide economic benefits for the full year 2010.

We expect interest expense will be unfavorable

year-over-year

due to the $1 billion senior notes offering we completed in
    the fourth quarter of 2009. The impact of this expense on our
    diluted earnings per share should be more than offset by the
    additional shares we repurchased with a portion of the proceeds
    from the notes offering.

The

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution product line, including

Gender Solutions

Knee Femoral Implants, the

LPS-Flex Knee, the

    the

Gender Solutions Natural-Knee

Flex System made a
    strong contribution. In Europe, changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates negatively affected knee sales by 6 percent.

The continued conversion to porous stems, including the

Hip Stem, led hip stem sales, but those
    sales were partially offset by weaker sales of cemented stems.

Trabecular Metal

Acetabular Cups and

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners also made strong
    contributions. In the U.S. hip market, we had some product
    gaps related to our acetabular cups which have affected sales
    growth. This was most noticeable in the area of

metal-on-metal

articulation. In November 2009, the

Continuum

Acetabular
    System and the

Zimmer MMC

Cup were cleared for sale in
    the U.S. These systems give surgeons a comprehensive array
    of acetabular cup solutions that, in concert with our
    comprehensive stem portfolio, provide additional patient
    matching options. These cups have also received approval in
    various countries outside the U.S. and will help complete
    our product portfolios in those countries as well. In Europe,
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected
    hip sales by 6 percent. In Asia Pacific, changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates positively affected hip sales by
    4 percent.

Bigliani/Flatow

Complete Shoulder Solution and the

Zimmer Trabecular Metal

Reverse Shoulder System led
    extremities sales.

Trabecular Metal

Technology is playing
    a critical role in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in
    the expanding extremities market.

Dental

The

Tapered Screw-Vent

Implant System led dental sales.
    Negative sales growth for our dental business reflects overall
    weakness in the global economy. We continue to believe the
    dental market will rebound as the global economy recovers and
    look forward to new opportunities as our product line is
    expanded through internal and external development efforts.

Trauma

Zimmer

Periarticular Locking Plates and the

ITST

Intertrochanteric/Subtrochanteric Fixation System led trauma
    sales but were partially offset by declining sales of
    compression hip screws. Femoral and tibial nails within the new

Zimmer Natural Nail

system also made a contribution
    during the year.

Spine

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we acquired Abbott Spine. As a
    result of the acquisition, spine sales have increased but the
    increase is offset in part by sales losses associated with the
    integration of the business. Solid sales of acquired fusion
    devices as well as legacy interbody devices and bone graft
    substitutes partly offset a significant decline in sales of the

Dynesys

Dynamic Stabilization System during the year. We
    expect our spinal business will continue to experience
    reimbursement challenges related to the

Dynesys

system.
    Following the November 2009 non-approvable recommendation by the
    FDA advisory panel of our request for additional approved uses
    for the

Dynesys

system, we are exploring our options,
    which are presently uncertain. We believe that we generally have
    a solid portfolio of spine products as well as broad global
    distribution capabilities that should lead to improved
    performance over time.

OSP and
    other

OSP sales were led by

PALACOS

Bone Cement.  OSP
    product sales growth improved in the second half of 2009 due to
    the effect of anniversarying out of the voluntary suspension and
    recall of certain products during 2008 and by the reintroduction
    of wound debridement products in 2009.

Cost of

Gross margin in 2009 was unchanged compared to 2008.
    Manufacturing costs per unit increased in 2009 due to lower
    production levels. Excess inventory and obsolescence charges
    increased in 2009 as a result of certain product-specific
    matters and new product launches. These costs were offset by
    foreign currency hedge gains recognized in the 2009 period
    compared to hedge losses recognized in 2008.

Under our hedging program, for derivatives which qualify as
    hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in
    fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income
    and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged
    item affects earnings.

Operating
    Expenses

Research and development expense, or R&D, increased to
    $205.4 million in 2009 from $192.3 million in 2008.
    This increase reflects additional spending on certain
    development, clinical and external research activities
    throughout 2009 in contrast to the delay in activities
    experienced in 2008 as we implemented our enhanced compliance
    program.

Selling, general and administrative expense, or SG&A,
    increased to $1,729.2 million in 2009, from
    $1,704.0 million in 2008. This is an increase of
    approximately 90 basis points compared to the prior year.
    SG&A expense in the 2008 period included approximately
    $60 million of incremental costs, such as monitor fees and
    consulting and legal fees associated with the global roll-out of
    our enhanced compliance program. The savings from these costs in
    2009 have been offset by increased spending to fund enhanced
    medical education programs, Abbott Spine costs and increased
    product liability claims. In this challenging economic
    environment, we are carefully managing our SG&A spend,
    reducing expenses in certain areas in order to fund growth and
    productivity initiatives. Areas of investment include marketing
    and promotion and medical education and training. The
    acquisition of Abbott Spine increased SG&A costs for items
    such as selling expenses, increased instrument depreciation and
    amortization of the acquired intangible assets. Additionally,
    SG&A as a percentage of net sales is negatively impacted by
    the decrease in revenues caused by changes in foreign currency
    rates. A majority of our SG&A spend is incurred in the
    U.S., primarily from our corporate headquarters and similar
    functions at our various businesses such as Dental, Trauma,
    Spine and OSP. Therefore, SG&A expense does not respond to
    changes in foreign currency rates proportionally to our revenue,
    which has caused SG&A as a percentage of net sales to
    increase.

Certain claims expense is a provision for estimated

Durom

Cup patients undergoing revision surgeries within specified
    times. A provision of $69.0 million was originally recorded
    during 2008 with an additional $35.0 million recorded
    during 2009, bringing the total provision to $104.0 million
    for these claims. For more information regarding these claims,
    see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

In connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed
    in the fourth quarter of 2009, we noted that the carrying value
    of the assets of our U.S. Spine reporting unit was in
    excess of its estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded a
    related goodwill impairment charge of $73.0 million during
    the year ended December 31, 2009. For more information
    regarding goodwill impairment and the factors that led to the
    impairment, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial
    statements. We have five other reporting units with goodwill
    assigned to them. We estimate the fair value of those reporting
    units using the income approach by discounting to present value
    the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. For each
    of those five reporting units, the estimated fair value
    substantially exceeds its carrying value.

ANNUAL REPORT

Acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses for
    2009 were $75.3 million compared to $68.5 million in
    2008. During 2009, we initiated a workforce realignment, which
    included the elimination of positions in some areas and
    increases in others to support long-term growth. As a result of
    this realignment and headcount reductions from acquisitions, we
    incurred approximately $19.0 million of severance and
    termination-related expenses. Other items in acquisition,
    integration, realignment and other expenses in 2009 included
    approximately $9.4 million of expenses related to contract
    termination costs, $23.4 million of certain litigation
    matters that were recognized during the period and various costs
    incurred to integrate the Abbott Spine business acquired in the
    fourth quarter of 2008. Included in acquisition, integration,
    realignment and other expenses in 2008 was $38.5 million of
    in-process research and development related to the Abbott Spine
    acquisition and other costs related to the integration of Abbott
    Spine. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
    for a more complete description of these charges.

We recognized a net curtailment and settlement gain of
    $32.1 million during 2009 related to amending our
    U.S. and Puerto Rico postretirement benefit plans. For more
    information regarding the net curtailment and settlement gain,
    see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

Operating
    Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings

Operating profit for 2009 decreased 7 percent to
    $1,018.8 million from $1,090.0 million in 2008. The
    decrease in operating profit is due to higher operating
    expenses, most notably the goodwill impairment charge.

Interest and other expense for 2009 increased to
    $20.6 million compared to income of $31.8 million in
    2008. Interest and other income in 2008 included a realized gain
    of $38.8 million related to the sale of certain marketable
    securities. Interest expense increased in the 2009 period as the
    result of increased long-term debt used to partially fund the
    Abbott Spine acquisition and the $1.0 billion senior notes
    offering during 2009.

The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes increased
    to 28.1 percent for 2009, up from 24.3 percent in
    2008. The effective tax rate for 2009 is negatively impacted by
    the goodwill impairment charge of $73.0 million recorded
    during 2009 for which no tax benefit was recorded. The effective
    tax rate for 2008 includes the impact of a current tax benefit
    of $31.7 million related to the 2007 settlement expense,
    resulting in a decrease of approximately 3 percent in the
    2008 effective tax rate. This impact on the 2008 effective tax
    rate was partially offset by Abbott Spine acquisition-related
    in-process research and development charges recorded during 2008
    for which no tax benefit was recorded. These discrete items
    account for the majority of the change in our effective tax rate

year-over-year.

Net earnings decreased 15 percent to $717.4 million
    for 2009, compared to $848.6 million in 2008, as a result
    of decreased operating profit, increased interest expense and an
    increased effective tax rate. Basic earnings per share in 2009
    decreased 10 percent to $3.34 from $3.73 in 2008. Diluted
    earnings per share decreased 11 percent to $3.32 from $3.72
    in 2008. The disproportional change in earnings per share as
    compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of 2009 and
    2008 share repurchases.

    the

Gross margin decreased in 2008 primarily due to the unfavorable
    effect of

year-over-year

changes in foreign currency hedge gains and losses as well as an
    increase in excess inventory and obsolescence charges due to
    write-offs related to the OSP patient care product recalls and
    increased inventory levels as a result of lower than forecasted
    sales. Inventory

step-up

Operating
    Expenses

R&D increased to $192.3 million for 2008 from
    $182.6 million in 2007 but remained unchanged as a percent
    of total sales. The

year-over-year

increase represents our continued investment in R&D to grow
    at or above sales growth.

SG&A expense increased to $1,704.0 million for 2008
    from $1,516.7 million in 2007. Increased SG&A costs
    include monitor fees paid as part of our 2007 civil settlement
    with the U.S. government regarding financial relationships
    with consulting orthopaedic surgeons, as well as consulting and
    legal fees associated with the global implementation of our
    enhanced compliance initiatives. Expenses related to other
    operating initiatives also caused an increase in SG&A as a
    percentage of net sales. Such operating initiatives include the
    planned implementation of a global IT system and improving
    quality systems at our Dover facility. Additionally, selling
    costs increased as a result of the ORTHOsoft acquisition, an
    increase in the headcount of our sales force in certain
    locations, increased commission incentives to sell certain key
    products and a change in the mix of commissions earned as a
    result of lower OSP sales.

Settlement expense of $169.5 million for 2007 relates to
    the payment we made as part of the 2007 civil settlement.

Certain claims expense of $69.0 million is a provision for
    estimated claims from

Durom

Cup patients undergoing
    revision surgeries within specified periods. For more
    information regarding these claims, see Note 17 to the
    consolidated financial statements.

Acquisition, integration and other expenses increased to
    $68.5 million for 2008, compared to $25.2 million in
    2007. The acquisition, integration and other expenses recorded
    during 2008 include $38.5 million for in-process research
    and development related to the Abbott Spine acquisition, costs
    related to the integration of Abbott Spine, facility
    consolidation costs, legal fees and retention and termination
    payments, partially offset by favorable adjustments to certain
    liabilities of acquired companies. The acquisition, integration
    and other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect in-process
    research and development write-offs related to acquisitions,
    costs related to the integration of acquired
    U.S. distributors, estimated settlements for certain
    pre-acquisition product liability claims, integration consulting
    fees and costs for integrating information technology systems.
    See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a
    more complete description of these charges.

Operating
    Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings

Operating profit for 2008 decreased 3 percent to
    $1,090.0 million from $1,127.6 million in 2007.
    Operating profit for 2007 included the effect of the
    non-recurring settlement expense of $169.5 million.
    Excluding the impact of the settlement expense in 2007,
    operating profit for 2008 would still have been unfavorable
    compared to 2007 as a result of lower gross margins, increases
    in SG&A costs attributable to the implementation of our
    enhanced compliance initiatives and certain claims expense of
    $69.0 million.

Interest and other income for 2008 increased to
    $31.8 million from $4.0 million in 2007. Interest and
    other income for 2008 includes a realized gain of
    $38.8 million related to the sale of certain marketable
    securities, partially offset by increased interest expense as a
    result of an increase in outstanding long-term debt.

The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes decreased
    to 24.3 percent for 2008, down from 31.6 percent in
    2007. The effective tax rate for the 2007 period reflects the
    effect of the $169.5 million settlement expense for which
    no tax benefit had previously been recognized. During 2008, we
    recorded a current tax benefit of $31.7 million related to
    the settlement expense, resulting in a decrease of approximately
    3 percent to the current period effective tax rate. The
    effective tax rate for 2008 was further reduced as a result of
    increased profits in lower tax jurisdictions. These decreases in
    the effective tax rate were partially offset by Abbott Spine
    acquisition-related in-process research and development



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.

ANNUAL REPORT

charges recorded during 2008 for which no tax benefit was
    recorded.

Net earnings increased 10 percent to $848.6 million
    for 2008 compared to $773.2 million in 2007, as the
    decrease in operating profit was more than offset by favorable
    items in interest and other income and a lower effective tax
    rate. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased
    14 percent to $3.73 and $3.72, respectively, from $3.28 and
    $3.26 in 2007. The higher growth rate in earnings per share as
    compared to net earnings is attributed to the effect of 2008 and
    2007 share repurchases.

LIQUIDITY AND
    CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows provided by operating activities were
    $1,117.5 million in 2009 compared to $1,038.1 million
    in 2008. The principal source of cash from operating activities
    in 2009 was net earnings. Non-cash charges included in net
    earnings accounted for another $446.4 million of operating
    cash. All other items of operating cash flows in 2009 reflect a
    use of $46.3 million of cash. The resolution of outstanding
    payments to healthcare professionals and institutions resulted
    in increased cash outflows during the 2009 period compared to
    the delay in similar payments during the 2008 period as we
    implemented our enhanced global compliance program. The
    resolution of these outstanding payments, along with a change in
    the timing of employee bonus payments compared to the 2008
    period and product liability payments, contributed to increased
    outflows from accrued expenses in 2009. These outflows were
    partially offset by improved accounts receivable collections and
    better inventory management.

At December 31, 2009, we had 56 days of sales
    outstanding in trade accounts receivable, a decrease of
    3 days when compared to December 31, 2008, reflecting
    improved collections across all geographic segments. At
    December 31, 2009, we had 302 days of inventory on
    hand, a decrease of 42 days compared to December 31,
    2008. Over the past two years we have made significant
    investments in inventory, including investments in response to
    growing demand for systems that provide more versatility and
    better fit for patients. In 2009 we made progress rationalizing
    these investments through reductions in field-based consignments
    and through the use of new inventory management tools to speed
    returns and redeployments. The continued build out of pipeline
    inventory for planned product launches should partially offset
    these reductions in field consignments in 2010.

Cash flows used in investing activities were $381.2 million
    in 2009 compared to $924.2 million in 2008. Additions to
    instruments decreased in 2009 compared to the 2008 period, as

year-over-year

spending on instruments declined compared to the significant
    investments made in 2008. In 2010, we expect to spend
    approximately $170 – $180 million on instruments
    to support new products and sales growth. Spending on other
    property, plant and equipment decreased to $105.1 million
    during 2009 compared to $250.0 million in the same 2008
    period. Spending on property, plant and equipment decreased
    compared to 2008 levels, as certain planned infrastructure
    initiatives from 2008 were completed and as we adjusted spending
    to lower production volumes. During 2010, we expect to purchase
    approximately $150 – $160 million in other
    property, plant and equipment, reflecting the cash outlays
    necessary to complete new product-related investments and normal
    replacement of older machinery and equipment. Acquired
    intellectual property rights were $35.8 million in 2009
    compared to $109.4 million in 2008. These items relate to
    lump-sum payments made to certain healthcare professionals and
    institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise
    would have been due under the terms of existing contractual
    arrangements. These lump-sum payments were based upon a third
    party fair market valuation of the current net present value of
    the contractual arrangements. During 2009 we invested excess
    cash of approximately $66.4 million in certificates of
    deposit that have original maturities greater than 90 days.
    Investments in other assets in both 2009 and 2008 primarily
    relate to payments to acquire certain foreign-based
    distributors. Investments in other assets in 2007 primarily
    related to payments to acquire Endius and ORTHOsoft. Included in
    investing cash flows in 2008 were $363.0 million paid to
    acquire Abbott Spine and $54.9 million of proceeds we
    received from the sale of certain equity securities.

Cash flows used in financing activities were $262.1 million
    for 2009 compared to $343.5 million in 2008. In November
    2009, we sold $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of
    senior unsecured notes (Senior Notes) in a public offering. We
    received net proceeds of approximately $998.8 million, net
    of an offering discount of $1.2 million. We also paid an
    additional $8.5 million of debt issuance costs related to
    the sale of the Senior Notes. The proceeds of the offering were
    used to repay amounts outstanding under our senior credit
    facility, to finance our stock repurchase program and for
    general corporate purposes. We repurchased $923.7 million
    of our common stock in 2009 as compared with $737.0 million
    in 2008 under our stock repurchase programs.

The Senior Notes include two tranches: $500 million
    aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due
    November 30, 2019, and $500 million aggregate
    principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due
    November 30, 2039. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable
    on May 30 and November 30 of each year beginning on May 30,
    2010 until maturity. The Senior Notes are rated A- by
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and are rated
    Baa1 by Moody’s Investors’ Service, Inc.

We may redeem the Senior Notes at our election in whole or in
    part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal
    to the greater of 1) 100 percent of the principal
    amount of the notes being redeemed; or 2) the sum of the
    present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal
    and interest (not including any portion of such payments of
    interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to
    the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury
    Rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 20 basis
    points, in the case of the 2019 notes, and 25 basis points,
    in the case of the 2039 notes. We will also pay the accrued and
    unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to the redemption date.

ANNUAL REPORT

We have a five year $1,350 million revolving,
    multi-currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing
    November 30, 2012 (Senior Credit Facility). We had
    $128.8 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility
    at December 31, 2009, and an availability of
    $1,221.2 million. The Senior Credit Facility contains
    provisions by which we can increase the line to
    $1,750 million.

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
    $84.1 million.

We may use excess cash or further borrow against our Senior
    Credit Facility, subject to limits set by our Board of
    Directors, to repurchase additional common stock under the
    $1.25 billion program which expires December 31, 2010.
    Approximately $211.1 million remains authorized for future
    repurchases under this plan.

Management believes that cash flows from operations and
    available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are
    sufficient to meet our expected working capital, capital
    expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment
    opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet
    and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if
    necessary.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our financial results are affected by the selection and
    application of accounting policies and methods. Significant
    accounting policies which require management’s judgment are
    discussed below.

Excess Inventory and Instruments

– We must
    determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our
    inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at
    our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if
    instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain
    undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are
    established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to
    net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of
    reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to
    historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our
    products and instrument systems and components. The basis for
    the determination is generally the same for all inventory and
    instrument items and categories except for

work-in-progress

inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued
    items are generally destroyed and completely written off.
    Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves
    based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other
    factors on a regular basis.

Income Taxes

– Our income tax expense, deferred
    tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax
    benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated
    future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both
    the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant
    judgments and estimates are required in determining the
    consolidated income tax expense.

We estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and
    assets by taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax
    assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability
    to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the
    benefits. We evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis
    and provide valuation allowances if it is determined to be
    “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit
    will not be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the
    portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected
    to be remitted to the U.S.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
    uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and
    regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global
    operations. We are subject to regulatory review or audit in
    virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and
    audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. We
    record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all
    relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws,
    our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status
    of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax
    authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial
    matters.

We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) guidance on income
    taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes
    as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously
    available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties,
    the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is
    materially different from our current estimate of the tax
    liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or
    decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are
    determined.

Commitments and Contingencies

– Accruals for
    product liability and other claims are established with the
    assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on
    current information and historical settlement information for
    claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not
    reported. We use an actuarial model to assist management in
    determining an appropriate level of accruals for product
    liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which
    are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.
    During 2009, in addition to our general product liability
    estimates and the $69.0 million provision recorded in 2008
    related to the

Durom

Cup, we recorded an additional
    provision for certain claims of $35.0 million representing
    management’s updated estimate of liability to

Durom

Cup patients undergoing revisions associated with surgeries
    occurring before July 2008 and within two years of the original
    surgery date. These parameters are consistent with our data
    which indicates that cup loosenings associated with surgical
    technique are most likely to occur within that time period. We
    expect to pay the majority of these claims within the next three
    years. Any claims received outside of these defined parameters
    will be managed in the normal course and reflected in our
    standard product liability accruals.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

– We evaluate
    the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible
    assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate
    the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the
    carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events
    or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate
    the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably
    estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such,
    these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable
    inputs. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record
    impairment charges on these assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we determined our U.S. Spine
    reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its
    estimated fair value. Fair value was determined using an equal
    weighting of income and market approaches. Fair value under the
    income approach was determined by discounting to present value
    the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. Fair
    value under the market approach utilized the comparable
    transaction methodology, which uses valuation indicators
    determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to
    our U.S. Spine reporting unit. Factors that contributed to
    the estimated fair value of the reporting unit being below its
    carrying value included a decrease in projected revenues related
    to the

Dynesys

Dynamic Stabilization System. This product
    line experienced increased competition and insurance
    reimbursement issues in 2009. We have been seeking approval from
    the FDA to market this product differently in the U.S., which
    would enhance its position in the market. However, in November
    2009 an FDA advisory panel issued a non-approvable
    recommendation, increasing the uncertainty of the estimated
    future cash flows. In addition to the

Dynesys

product,
    revenues from other products have been affected as we work
    through the integration of the sales channel following the
    Abbott Spine acquisition.

As a result, we recorded a related goodwill impairment charge of
    $73.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.

We have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to
    them. We estimate the fair value of those reporting units using
    the income approach by discounting to present value the
    estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. For each of
    those five reporting units, the estimated fair value
    substantially exceeds its carrying value.

Share-based Payment

– We measure share-based
    payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the
    award and recognize expense over the requisite service period.
    Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant
    date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life
    of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock.
    Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share-based awards
    that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected
    volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively
    traded options. The expected life of stock options and estimated
    forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical
    exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions used in
    determining the grant date fair value and the expected
    forfeitures represent management’s best estimates.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

MARKET
    RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing
    business operations, including risks from changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices
    that could affect our financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market
    risks through regular operating and financing activities and
    through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use
    derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools
    and not for speculative investment purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
    EXCHANGE RISK

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
    could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency
    exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets
    denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British
    Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won and
    Swedish Krona. We manage the foreign currency exposure
    centrally, on a combined basis, which allows us to net exposures
    and to take advantage of any natural offsets. To reduce the
    uncertainty of foreign currency exchange rate movements on
    transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into
    derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency
    exchange forward contracts and options with major financial
    institutions. These forward contracts and options are designed
    to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily
    intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods
    consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and
    losses on these contracts and options that qualify as cash flow
    hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income,
    then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item
    affects net earnings.

For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009, we had
    obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros,
    Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian
    Dollars, Korean Won and Swedish Krona and purchase Swiss Francs
    and sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from
    January 2010 through June 2012. The notional amounts of
    outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to
    purchase U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2009 and 2008
    were $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The
    notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into
    with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at December 31,
    2009 and 2008 were $202.4 million and $207.5 million,
    respectively. The weighted average contract rates outstanding
    are Euro:USD 1.40, USD:Swiss Franc 1.10, USD:Japanese Yen 94,
    British Pound:USD 1.66, USD:Canadian Dollar 1.11, Australian
    Dollar:USD 0.75, USD:Korean Won 1,208 and USD:Swedish Krona 7.52.

We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk
    management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms
    of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted
    transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges,
    changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are
    generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the
    fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management
    program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess
    potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and
    financial position relating to hypothetical movements in
    currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in
    the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts
    outstanding at December 31, 2009 indicated that, if the
    U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent
    relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound,
    Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Korean Won and Swedish
    Krona, with no change in the interest differentials, the fair
    value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings
    before income taxes in periods through 2012, depending on the
    direction of the change, by an average approximate amount of
    $54.9 million, $20.5 million, $25.0 million,
    $10.2 million, $4.7 million, $9.9 million,
    $2.9 million and $1.8 million for the Euro, Swiss
    Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Australian
    Dollar, Korean Won and Swedish Krona contracts, respectively.
    Any change in the fair value of foreign currency exchange
    forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency
    exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in
    the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign
    currency exchange contracts would not subject us to material
    risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on
    these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets,
    liabilities and transactions being hedged.

We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency
    denominated assets and liabilities of approximately
    $2,346 million at December 31, 2009, primarily in
    Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and Euros. Approximately
    $1,309 million of the net asset exposure at
    December 31, 2009 relates to goodwill recorded in the
    Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and
    liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
    entity’s functional currency. As a result, foreign currency
    remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are generally
    offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward
    exchange contracts in the same reporting period.

COMMODITY PRICE
    RISK

We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome,
    titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into
    supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months,
    where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of
    market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk management
    program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential
    commodity price changes. A 10 percent price change across
    all these commodities would not have a



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

material effect on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

INTEREST RATE
    RISK

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk
    from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of
    operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to
    interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing
    activities.

Presently, we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in
    U.S. government treasury funds and bank deposits. The
    primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation
    of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market
    risk. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments
    in our investment portfolio.

Our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the
    variable rates associated with our credit facilities. Our Senior
    Notes have fixed interest rates and are not exposed to any risk
    from movement in interest rates. We are subject to interest rate
    risk through movements in interest rates on the committed Senior
    Credit Facility and our uncommitted credit facilities.
    Presently, all of our debt outstanding under the Senior Credit
    Facility bears interest at short-term rates. We currently do not
    hedge our interest rate exposure, but we may do so in the
    future. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of
    December 31, 2009, a change of 10 percent in interest
    rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would
    not have a material effect on interest expense. Further, this
    analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level
    of overall economic activity that could exist in such an
    environment.

CREDIT
    RISK

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash, cash
    equivalents, counterparty transactions and accounts receivable.

We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions
    and money market instruments and limit the amount of credit
    exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any
    significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents and
    investments.

We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with
    which we conduct business fail to perform. However, this loss is
    limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the
    counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our
    obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing
    with a diversified group of major financial institutions. We
    manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our
    counterparties using standard credit guidelines. We do not
    anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
    receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and
    their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by
    frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to
    whom credit is granted in the normal course of business.
    However, essentially all of our trade receivables are
    concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare
    industry in the U.S. and internationally or with
    distributors or dealers who operate in international markets
    and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business,
    economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent
    upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the
    respective countries’ national economic and healthcare
    systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit
    approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and we
    believe that reserves for losses are adequate. There is no
    significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other
    major concentration of credit risk.

Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the company’s Board of Directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, the
    company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

.

Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2009, the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The company’s independent registered public accounting firm
    has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
    as stated in its report which appears in Item 8 of this

    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated

    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain tax positions in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BUSINESS

We design, develop, manufacture and market orthopaedic
    reconstructive implants, dental implants, spinal implants,
    trauma products and related surgical products. We also provide
    other healthcare related services. Orthopaedic reconstructive
    implants restore function lost due to disease or trauma in
    joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental
    reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in
    patients who have lost teeth due to trauma or disease. Spinal
    implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons
    in the treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and
    trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma products are devices
    used primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue
    to support the body’s natural healing process. Our related
    surgical products include surgical supplies and instruments
    designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and
    post-operation rehabilitation. We have operations in more than
    25 countries and market our products in more than 100 countries.
    We operate in a single industry but have three reportable
    geographic segments, the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.

The words “we”, “us”, “our” and
    similar words refer to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

– The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Zimmer Holdings and
    its subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling equity
    position. Investments in companies in which we exercise
    significant influence over the operating and financial affairs,
    but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method.
    Under the equity method, we record the investment at cost and
    adjust the carrying amount of the investment by our
    proportionate share of the investee’s net earnings or
    losses. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
    are eliminated. Certain amounts in the 2008 and 2007
    consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
    conform to the 2009 presentation.

Use of Estimates

– The consolidated financial
    statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States which require us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

– The financial
    statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into
    U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and
    liabilities and average exchange rates for operating results.
    Unrealized translation gains and losses are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’
    equity. When a transaction is denominated in a currency other
    than the subsidiary’s functional currency, we recognize a
    transaction gain or loss when the transaction is settled.
    Foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in net
    earnings for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007 were not significant.

Revenue Recognition

– We sell product through
    three principal channels: 1) direct to healthcare
    institutions, referred to as direct channel accounts;
    2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers;
    and 3) directly to dental practices and dental
    laboratories. The direct channel accounts represent
    approximately 80 percent of our net sales. Through this
    channel, inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or
    customers so that products are available when needed for
    surgical procedures. No revenue is recognized upon the placement
    of inventory into consignment as we retain title and maintain
    the inventory on our balance sheet. Upon implantation, we issue
    an invoice and revenue is recognized. Pricing for products is
    generally predetermined by contracts with customers, agents
    acting on behalf of customer groups or by government regulatory
    bodies, depending on the market. Price discounts under group
    purchasing contracts are generally linked to volume of implant
    purchases by customer healthcare institutions within a specified
    group. At negotiated thresholds within a contract buying period,
    price discounts may increase. Sales to stocking distributors,
    healthcare dealers, dental practices and dental laboratories
    account for approximately 20 percent of our net sales. With
    these types of sales, revenue is recognized when title to
    product passes, either upon shipment of the product or in some
    cases upon implantation of the product. Product is generally
    sold at contractually fixed prices for specified periods.
    Payment terms vary by customer, but are typically less than
    90 days. In some cases sales incentives may be earned by a
    customer for purchasing a specified amount of our product. We
    estimate whether such incentives will be achieved and, if so,
    recognize these incentives as a reduction in revenue in the same
    period the underlying revenue transaction is recognized.
    Occasionally products are returned, and, accordingly, we
    maintain an estimated sales return reserve that is recorded as a
    reduction in revenue. Product returns were not significant for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

The reserves for doubtful accounts were $18.8 million and
    $20.0 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Shipping and Handling

– Amounts billed to
    customers for shipping and handling of products are reflected in
    net sales and are not significant. Expenses incurred related to
    shipping and handling of products are reflected in selling,
    general and administrative and were $121.8 million,
    $117.3 million and $104.1 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Acquisition, Integration, Realignment and
    Other

– We recognize expenses resulting directly
    from our business combinations and other items as
    “Acquisition, integration,

Adjustment or impairment of acquired assets and obligations
    relates to impairment on assets that were acquired in business
    combinations or adjustments to certain liabilities of acquired
    companies due to changes in circumstances surrounding those
    liabilities subsequent to the related measurement period.

Consulting and professional fees relate to third-party
    integration consulting performed in a variety of areas such as
    tax, compliance, logistics and human resources and include
    third-party fees related to severance and termination benefits
    matters. These fees also include legal fees related to
    litigation matters involving acquired businesses that existed
    prior to our acquisition or resulted from our acquisition.

During 2009, we commenced a global realignment initiative to
    focus on business opportunities that best support our strategic
    priorities. As part of this realignment, we initiated changes in
    our work force, eliminating positions in some areas and
    increasing others. Approximately 300 employees from across
    the globe were affected by these actions. As a result of these
    changes in our work force and headcount reductions from
    acquisitions, we recorded expense of $19.0 million related
    to severance and other employee termination-related costs. These
    termination benefits were provided in accordance with our
    existing or local government policies and are considered ongoing
    benefits. These costs were accrued when they became probable and
    estimable and were recorded as part of other current
    liabilities. The majority of these costs were paid during 2009.

Information technology integration relates to the
    non-capitalizable costs associated with integrating the
    information systems of acquired businesses.

In-process research and development charges for 2008 relate to
    the acquisition of Abbott Spine. In-process research and
    development charges for 2007 relate to the acquisitions of
    Endius and ORTHOsoft.

In 2009, we ceased using certain leased facilities and,
    accordingly, recorded expense for the remaining lease payments,
    less estimated sublease recoveries, and wrote-off any assets
    being used in those facilities.

Facility and employee relocation relates to costs associated
    with relocating certain facilities. Most notably, we
    consolidated our legacy European distribution centers into a new
    distribution center in Eschbach, Germany.

Over the past three years we have acquired a number of
    U.S. and foreign-based distributors. We have incurred
    various costs related to the acquisition and integration of
    those businesses.

Certain litigation matters relate to costs recognized during the
    year for the estimated or actual settlement of various legal
    matters, including patent litigation matters, commercial
    litigation matters and matters arising from our acquisitions of
    certain competitive distributorships in prior years. We
    recognize expense for the potential settlement of a legal matter
    when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and
    we can reasonably estimate the loss. In 2009, we made a
    concerted effort to settle many of these matters to avoid
    further litigation costs.

Contract termination costs relate to terminated agreements in
    connection with the integration of acquired companies. The
    terminated contracts primarily relate to sales agents and
    distribution agreements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

– We consider all
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts
    reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents are
    valued at cost, which approximates their fair value.

Certificates of Deposit

– We invest in cash
    deposits with original maturities greater than three months and
    classify these investments as certificates of deposit on our
    consolidated balance sheet. The carrying amounts reported in the
    balance sheet for certificates of deposit are valued at cost,
    which approximates their fair value.

Inventories

– Inventories, net of allowances
    for obsolete and slow-moving goods, are stated at the lower of
    cost or market, with cost determined on a

first-in

first-out basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

– Property, plant
    and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
    estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and
    improvements and three to eight years for machinery and
    equipment. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. We
    review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss
    would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash
    flows relating to the asset are less than its carrying amount.
    An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the
    carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value.

Software Costs

– We capitalize certain computer
    software and software development costs incurred in connection
    with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use
    when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is
    probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized
    software costs generally include external direct costs of
    materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining
    computer software and compensation and related benefits for
    employees who are directly associated with the software project.
    Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and
    equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line
    basis when the software is ready for its intended use over the
    estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate three
    to ten years.

Instruments

– Instruments are hand-held devices
    used by surgeons during total joint replacement and other
    surgical procedures. Instruments are recognized as long-lived
    assets and are included in property, plant and equipment.
    Undeployed instruments are carried at cost, net of allowances
    for excess and obsolete instruments. Instruments in the field
    are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
    is computed using the straight-line method based on average
    estimated useful lives, determined principally in reference to
    associated product life cycles, primarily five years. We review
    instruments for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an instrument
    may not be recoverable. Depreciation of instruments is
    recognized as selling, general and administrative expense.

Goodwill

– Goodwill is not amortized but is
    subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill has been assigned
    to reporting units. We perform annual impairment tests by
    comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying
    amount to determine if there is potential impairment. The fair
    value of the reporting unit and the implied fair value of
    goodwill are determined based upon a discounted cash flow
    analysis. Significant assumptions are incorporated into these
    discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth rates and
    risk-adjusted discount rates. We perform this test in the fourth
    quarter of the year or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting
    unit’s assets may not be recoverable. If the fair value of
    the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an
    impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair
    value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying
    value of the reporting unit goodwill. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge
    of $73.0 million related to our U.S. Spine reporting
    unit. See Note 8 for more information regarding goodwill
    and goodwill impairment.

Intangible Assets

– Intangible assets are
    initially measured at their fair value. We have determined the
    fair value of our intangible assets either by the fair value of
    the consideration exchanged for the intangible asset or the
    estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected to be
    generated from the intangible asset. Intangible assets with an
    indefinite life, including certain trademarks and trade names,
    are not amortized. Indefinite life intangible assets are
    assessed annually to determine whether events and circumstances
    continue to support an indefinite life. Intangible assets with a
    finite life, including core and developed technology, certain
    trademarks and trade names, customer-related intangibles,
    intellectual property rights and patents and licenses are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
    life, ranging from less than one year to 40 years.
    Intangible assets with a finite life are tested for impairment
    whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with an
    indefinite life are tested for impairment annually or whenever
    events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
    not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the
    carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
    The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be
    determined based upon the excess of the asset’s carrying
    value over its fair value. The fair values of indefinite lived
    intangible assets are determined based upon a discounted cash
    flow analysis using the relief from royalty method. The relief
    from royalty method estimates the cost savings associated with
    owning, rather than licensing, assets. Significant assumptions
    are incorporated into these discounted cash flow analyses such
    as estimated growth rates, royalty rates and risk-adjusted
    discount rates.

In determining the useful lives of intangible assets, we
    consider the expected use of the assets and the effects of
    obsolescence, demand, competition, anticipated technological
    advances, changes in surgical techniques, market influences and
    other economic factors. For technology-based intangible assets,
    we consider the expected life cycles of products, absent
    unforeseen technological advances, which incorporate the
    corresponding technology. Trademarks and trade names that do not
    have a wasting characteristic (i.e., there are no legal,
    regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors
    which limit the useful life) are assigned an indefinite life.
    Trademarks and trade names that are related to products expected
    to be phased out are assigned lives consistent with the period
    in which the products bearing each brand are expected to be
    sold. For customer relationship intangible assets, we assign
    useful lives based upon historical levels of customer attrition.
    Intellectual property rights are assigned useful lives that
    approximate the contractual life of any related patent or the
    period for which we maintain exclusivity over the intellectual
    property.

Research and Development

– We expense all
    research and development costs as incurred. Research and
    development costs include salaries, prototypes, depreciation of
    equipment used in research and development, consultant fees and
    service fees paid to collaborative partners.

Income Taxes

– We account for income taxes
    under the asset and liability method, which requires the
    recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
    expected future tax

(Continued)

consequences of events that have been included in the financial
    statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based on the differences between the
    financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities
    using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in
    tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized
    in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these
    assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such
    determination, we consider all available positive and negative
    evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable
    temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax
    planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the
    event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our
    deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net
    recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation
    allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
    Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income
    of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the
    U.S.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– We measure
    all derivative instruments at fair value and report them on our
    consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. We maintain
    written policies and procedures that permit, under appropriate
    circumstances and subject to proper authorization, the use of
    derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes.
    The use of derivative financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes is prohibited by our policy. See
    Note 11 for more information regarding our derivative and
    hedging activities.

Other Comprehensive Income

– Other
    comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and
    losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are
    included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net
    earnings as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment
    to stockholders’ equity. Other comprehensive income is
    comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments,
    unrealized foreign currency hedge gains and losses, unrealized
    gains and losses on

available-for-sale

securities and amortization of prior service costs and
    unrecognized gains and losses in actuarial assumptions.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as

During 2008, we reclassified an investment previously accounted
    for under the equity method to an

available-for-sale

investment as we no longer exercised significant influence over
    the third-party investee. The investment was

marked-to-market

in accordance with the FASB’s guidance on accounting for
    certain investments in debt and equity securities, resulting in
    a net unrealized gain of $23.8 million recorded in other
    comprehensive income for 2008. This unrealized gain was
    reclassified to the income statement when we sold this
    investment in 2008 for total proceeds of $54.9 million and
    a gross realized gain of $38.8 million included in interest
    and other income. The basis of these securities was determined
    based on the consideration paid at the time of acquisition.

Treasury Stock

– We account for repurchases of
    common stock under the cost method and present treasury stock as
    a reduction of shareholders equity. We reissue common stock held
    in treasury only for limited purposes.

Noncontrolling Interest

– On January 1,
    2009, we adopted the FASB’s newly issued guidance related
    to noncontrolling interests. This new guidance changes the
    accounting and reporting for minority interests, which are now
    recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
    component of equity. This new guidance requires retroactive
    adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for
    existing noncontrolling interests. This adoption did not have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements or
    results of operations. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, we acquired 100 percent ownership of our only
    outstanding noncontrolling interest for approximately
    $8.6 million. This purchase was recorded as an equity
    transaction and is reflected as a financing activity in our
    consolidated statement of cash flows. As a result, the carrying
    balance of the noncontrolling interests of $3.6 million was
    eliminated, and the remaining $5.0 million, representing
    the difference between the purchase price and carrying balance,
    was recorded as a reduction in paid-in capital. Transactions
    with noncontrolling interests had the following

Accounting Pronouncements

– In September 2006,
    the FASB issued guidance related to fair value measurements,
    which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
    fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance
    did not require any new fair value measurements, but provided
    guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value
    hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. In
    February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of certain
    provisions of this fair value guidance relating to non-financial
    assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring
    basis until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
    In January 2009, we adopted these additional provisions of the
    FASB’s fair value guidance. This adoption did not have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements or
    results of operations. See Note 7 for more information on
    fair value measurements of assets and liabilities.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted the FASB’s newly issued
    guidance related to business combinations. This guidance
    introduces new purchase accounting concepts, expands the use of
    fair value accounting related to business combinations and
    changes the subsequent period accounting for certain acquired
    assets and liabilities. Additionally, it changes the accounting
    for deferred tax assets and income tax reserves recorded as part
    of a business combination. If a remeasurement of these assets or
    liabilities is warranted after January 1, 2009, it will
    affect income tax expense as opposed to the previous accounting
    guidance which would have required goodwill to be adjusted. We
    have applied this guidance to business combinations with
    acquisition dates occurring in 2009. This adoption did not have
    a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or
    results of operations.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted the FASB’s newly issued
    guidance related to disclosures about derivative instruments and
    hedging activities. This guidance requires increased disclosure
    of our derivative and hedging activities, including how
    derivative and hedging activities affect our consolidated
    statement of earnings, balance sheet and cash flows, but does
    not impact our financial position or results of operations. See
    Note 11 for more information on our derivative instruments
    and hedging activities.

In May 2009, the FASB issued new guidance related to the
    accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events, which is
    effective for interim and annual periods ending after
    June 15, 2009. This new guidance establishes general
    standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur
    after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are
    issued or are available to be issued. This guidance introduces
    new terminology but is based on the same principles that
    previously existed in the auditing standards. Under this new
    guidance we are required to provide disclosure of the date
    through which we have evaluated subsequent events and whether
    that date represents the date the financial statements were
    issued or the date the financial statements were available to be
    issued. For the financial statements related to the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 contained herein, we have
    evaluated subsequent events through February 25, 2010
    representing the date these financial statements were issued.

In July 2006, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
    financial statements. This guidance provides that a tax benefit
    from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more
    likely than not that the position will be sustained upon
    examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or
    litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax
    positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold
    at the effective date and in subsequent periods to be
    recognized. The FASB also provided guidance on measurement,
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We
    adopted the FASB guidance effective January 1, 2007.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Our share-based payments primarily consist of stock options,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance
    shares and an employee stock purchase plan. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, share-based payment expense was
    $75.3 million or $54.4 million net of the related tax
    benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2008, share-based
    payment expense was $69.9 million or $49.5 million net
    of the related tax benefits. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, share-based payment expense was
    $70.1 million or $48.1 million net of the related tax
    benefits.

Stock
    Options

We had two equity compensation plans in effect at
    December 31, 2009: the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (2009
    Plan) and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2009
    Plan succeeds the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006
    Plan”) and the TeamShare Stock Option Plan (TeamShare
    Plan). Following stockholder approval of the 2009 Plan in May
    2009, no further awards were granted under the 2006 Plan or
    under the TeamShare Plan, and shares remaining available for

grant under those plans are expected to be merged into the 2009
    Plan. Vested and unvested stock options and unvested restricted
    stock and RSUs previously granted under the 2006 Plan, the
    TeamShare Plan and another prior plan, the 2001 Stock Incentive
    Plan, remained outstanding as of December 31, 2009. We have
    reserved the maximum number of shares of common stock available
    for award under the terms of each of these plans. We have
    registered 52.9 million shares of common stock and expect
    to register an additional 5 million shares under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2009 Plan provides for
    the grant of nonqualified stock options and incentive stock
    options, long-term performance awards in the form of performance
    shares or units, restricted stock, RSUs and stock appreciation
    rights. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of
    the Board of Directors determines the grant date for annual
    grants under our equity compensation plans. The date for annual
    grants under the 2009 Plan to our executive officers is expected
    to occur in the first quarter of each year following the
    earnings announcements for the previous quarter and full year.
    The Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides for awards of
    stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to non-employee
    directors. It has been our practice to issue shares of common
    stock upon exercise of stock options from previously unissued
    shares. The total number of awards which may be granted in a
    given year

and/or

over
    the life of the plan under each of our equity compensation plans
    is limited. At December 31, 2009, an aggregate of
    14.2 million shares were available for future grants and
    awards under these plans.

Stock options granted to date under our plans generally vest
    over four years and generally have a maximum contractual life of
    10 years. As established under our equity compensation
    plans, vesting may accelerate upon retirement after the first
    anniversary date of the award if certain criteria are met. We
    recognize expense related to stock options on a straight-line
    basis over the requisite service period, less awards expected to
    be forfeited using estimated forfeiture rates. Due to the
    accelerated retirement provisions, the requisite service period
    of our stock options range from one to four years. Stock options
    are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of
    our common stock on the date of grant, except in limited
    circumstances where local law may dictate otherwise. In the
    past, certain options have had price thresholds, which affect
    exercisability. All such price thresholds have been satisfied.
    The total number of awards which may be granted in a given year

and/or

over
    the life of the plan under each of our stock option plans is
    limited to control dilution.

We use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the
    fair value of our stock options. Expected volatility was derived
    from the implied volatility of our traded options that were
    actively traded around the grant date of the stock options with
    exercise prices similar to the stock options and maturities of
    over one year. The expected term of the stock options has been
    derived from historical employee exercise behavior. The
    risk-free interest rate is determined using the implied yield
    currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues
    with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options.
    A dividend yield of zero percent has been used as we have not
    paid a dividend since becoming a public company in 2001 and we
    do not expect to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2009, there was $85.1 million of
    unrecognized share-based payment expense related to nonvested
    stock options granted under our plans. That expense is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    2.3 years.

Performance
    Shares and RSUs

We have utilized both performance shares and RSUs as share-based
    payments to our employees. Some of these awards have had service
    conditions while others have had performance conditions. The
    terms of the service condition awards have been either two or
    four years with vesting occurring ratably on the anniversary
    date of the award. However, based upon meeting certain criteria,
    as established under our equity compensation plans, these awards
    may accelerate upon retirement after the first anniversary date
    of the award. Accordingly, the requisite service period used for
    share-based payment expense ranges from one to four years.

The vesting of the awards with performance conditions was based
    upon the achievement of objective performance targets over
    multiple year periods. For these performance-based awards, it
    was determined in 2008 that the performance targets would not be
    achieved. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, no
    performance-based awards were outstanding.

A summary of nonvested RSU activity for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 is as follows (in thousands):

The fair value of the awards was determined based upon the fair
    market value of our common stock on the date of grant. We are
    required to estimate the number of RSUs that will vest and
    recognize share-based payment expense on a straight-line basis
    over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2009,
    we estimate that approximately 404,000 outstanding RSUs will
    vest. If our estimate were to change in the future, the
    cumulative effect of the change in estimate will be recorded in
    that period. Based upon the number of RSUs that we expect to
    vest, the unrecognized share-based payment expense as of
    December 31, 2009 was $13.2 million and is expected to
    be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.1 years.
    For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    pre-tax expense (income) related to these awards was
    $13.4 million, $4.5 million and $(3.3) million,
    respectively, or $9.7 million, $3.2 million and
    $(2.3) million net of the related tax benefits,
    respectively.

ACQUISITIONS

We made acquisitions during the years 2009, 2008 and 2007, the
    most significant of which was our acquisition of Abbott Spine in
    2008, which is described below. The results of operations of the
    acquired companies have been included in our consolidated
    results of operations subsequent to the transaction dates, and
    the respective assets and liabilities of the acquired companies
    have been recorded at their estimated fair values in our
    consolidated statement of financial position as of the
    transaction dates, with any excess purchase price being
    allocated to goodwill. Pro forma financial information and other
    information required by the FASB’s guidance on business
    combinations have not been included as the acquisitions did not
    have a material impact upon our financial position or results of
    operations.

Abbott
    Spine

In October 2008, we acquired Abbott Spine, a former subsidiary
    of Abbott Laboratories, for an aggregate value of approximately
    $363.0 million, including a $358.0 million cash
    purchase price after certain working capital adjustments and
    $5.0 million of direct acquisition costs.

In 2009 we completed the final purchase price allocation, which
    reflects additional contract termination liabilities, changes to
    the preliminary fair values assigned to acquired inventory and
    changes to deferred taxes.

In 2009, goodwill relating to our U.S. Spine reporting unit
    with a carrying amount of $415.9 million was written down
    to its implied fair value of $342.9 million, resulting in
    an impairment charge of $73.0 million. The implied fair
    value of goodwill equals the estimated fair value of a reporting
    unit minus the fair value of the reporting unit’s net
    assets. Accordingly, in determining the implied fair value of
    the U.S. Spine reporting unit goodwill, we used
    unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of the reporting
    unit and its assets and liabilities. Fair value was determined
    using an equal weighting of income and market approaches. Fair
    value under the income approach was determined by discounting to
    present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting
    unit. Fair value under the market approach utilized the
    comparable transaction methodology, which uses valuation
    indicators determined from sales of other businesses that are
    similar to our U.S. Spine reporting unit. In estimating the
    future cash flows of the reporting unit, we utilized a
    combination of market and company specific inputs that a market
    participant would use in assessing the fair value of the
    reporting unit. The primary market input was revenue growth
    rates. These rates were based upon historical trends and
    estimated future growth drivers such as an aging global
    population, obesity and more active lifestyles. Significant
    company specific inputs included assumptions regarding how the
    reporting unit could leverage operating expenses as revenue
    grows and the impact any new products will have on revenues.
    Under the comparable transaction methodology, we took into
    consideration when the comparable transaction occurred and the
    differences that may exist due to changes in the economic
    environment. We also took into consideration differences between
    the comparable companies and our U.S. Spine reporting unit
    that could affect fair value, such as cash and debt levels.

The fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and
    liabilities were determined by using the same methods that are
    used in business combination purchase accounting. See
    Note 8 for further information regarding this goodwill
    impairment.

There were no other significant nonfinancial assets that were
    measured at fair value in the year ending December 31, 2009.

We conduct our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of
    every year or whenever events occur or circumstances change that
    would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting
    unit below its carrying amount. In the fourth quarter of 2009,
    we determined our U.S. Spine reporting unit’s carrying
    value was in excess of its estimated fair value. Fair value was
    determined using an equal weighting of income and market
    approaches. Factors that contributed to the estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value included a
    decrease in projected revenues related to the

Dynesys

Dynamic Stabilization System. This product line experienced
    increased competition and insurance reimbursement issues in
    2009. We have been seeking approval from the FDA to market this
    product differently in the U.S., which would enhance its
    position in the market. However, in November 2009 an FDA
    advisory panel issued a non-approvable recommendation,
    increasing the uncertainty of the

    HOLDINGS, INC.

(Continued)

estimated future cash flows. In addition to the

Dynesys

product, revenues from other products have been affected as
    we work through the integration of the sales channel following
    the Abbott Spine acquisition.

As a result, we recorded a related goodwill impairment charge of
    approximately $73.0 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Before the impairment charge, goodwill
    assigned to this reporting unit was approximately
    $416 million, of which approximately two-thirds arose from
    the Centerpulse acquisition in 2003 and the remaining from the
    Abbott Spine acquisition in 2008.

We have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to
    them. We estimate the fair value of those reporting units using
    the income approach by discounting to present value the
    estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. For each of
    those five reporting units, the estimated fair value
    substantially exceeds its carrying value.

We will continue to monitor the fair value of our
    U.S. Spine reporting until as well as our other five
    reporting units in our interim and annual reporting periods. If
    our estimated cash flows for these reporting units decrease, we
    may have to record further impairment charges in the future.
    Factors that could result in our cash flows being lower than our
    current estimates include: 1) decreased revenues caused by
    changes in the healthcare market, or our inability to generate
    new product revenue from our research and development
    activities, and 2) if we are not able to achieve the
    estimated operating margins in our forecasts due to unforeseen
    factors. Additionally, changes in the broader economic
    environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates
    which will impact our estimated fair values.

During 2009, we made lump-sum payments of $35.8 million to
    certain healthcare professionals and institutions in place of
    future royalty payments that otherwise would have been due under
    the terms of existing contractual arrangements. Such payments
    were based upon a third party fair market valuation of the
    current net present value of the contractual arrangements. Under
    the terms of these resolutions, we acquired the exclusive rights
    to any intellectual property, patented and unpatented, provided
    by the healthcare professional or institution during the course
    of the original contractual arrangements. The weighted average
    useful life for these assets is 5.6 years, which represents
    the life of any related patent or the period for which we
    maintain exclusivity to the intellectual property. Amortization
    expense for these assets is reported as part of cost of goods
    sold.

Total amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets
    was $93.2 million, $59.3 million and
    $47.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. For 2009, $33.6 million of
    amortization expense was recorded as part of cost of goods sold,
    with the remaining $59.6 million recorded as part of
    selling, general and administrative expenses. For 2008,
    $6.7 million of amortization expense was recorded as part
    of cost of goods sold, with the remaining $52.6 million
    recorded as part of selling, general and administrative
    expenses. For 2007, all amortization expense was recorded as
    part of selling, general and administrative expenses. Estimated
    annual amortization expense for the years ending
    December 31, 2010 through 2014 is $89.7 million,
    $80.9 million, $73.4 million, $66.8 million and
    $62.6 million, respectively.

DEBT

In November 2009, we sold $500 million aggregate principal
    amount of our 4.625% Senior Notes due November 30,
    2019 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of our
    5.75% Senior Notes due November 30, 2039 (Senior
    Notes) in a public offering. Interest is payable on May 30 and
    November 30 of each year beginning on May 30, 2010 until
    maturity. We received net proceeds of approximately
    $998.8 million, net of an offering discount of
    $1.2 million. The Senior Notes carry an effective interest
    rate of 4.634% and 5.762%, respectively. We used the proceeds to
    repay amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility, to
    finance our stock repurchase program and for general corporate
    purposes.

We may redeem the Senior Notes at our election in whole or in
    part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal
    to the greater of 1) 100 percent of the principal
    amount of the notes being redeemed; or 2) the sum of the
    present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal
    and interest (not including any portion of such payments of
    interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to
    the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury
    Rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 20 basis
    points, in the case of the 2019 notes, and 25 basis points,
    in the case of the 2039 notes. We will also pay the accrued and
    unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to the redemption date.

We have a five year $1,350 million senior credit agreement
    (Senior Credit Facility). The Senior Credit Facility is a
    revolving, multi-currency, senior unsecured credit facility
    maturing November 30, 2012. Available borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2009 were
    $1,221.2 million. The Senior Credit Facility contains
    provisions whereby borrowings may be increased to
    $1,750 million.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the
    borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus
    an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior
    unsecured long-term credit rating and the amounts drawn under
    the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a
    fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. The
    Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and
    negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured
    financing arrangement, including, among other things,
    limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
    Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to
    1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If we
    fall below an investment grade credit rating, additional
    restrictions would result, including restrictions on
    investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were
    in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit
    Facility as of December 31, 2009. Commitments under the
    Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a
    facility and a utilization fee. Borrowings under the Senior
    Credit Facility were Japanese Yen-based borrowings at
    December 31, 2009 and U.S. Dollar and Japanese
    Yen-based borrowings at December 31, 2008.

Outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2009 was
    $1,127.6 million, comprised of $998.8 million from our
    Senior Notes and $128.8 from our Senior Credit Facility. As of
    December 31, 2008, $460.1 million was outstanding from
    our Senior Credit Facility. We had no short-term debt as of
    December 31, 2009 or 2008. The estimated fair value of our
    Senior Notes as of December 31, 2009 was
    $992.1 million. The carrying value of the Senior Credit
    Facility approximates fair value, as the underlying instruments
    have variable interest rates at market value.

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
    $84.1 million.

The weighted average interest rate for all borrowings was
    4.7 percent at December 31, 2009. We paid
    $17.0 million, $14.0 million and $8.5 million in
    interest during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Debt issuance costs of $22.8 million were incurred to
    obtain the Senior Credit Facility and debt issuance costs of
    $8.5 million were incurred during the sale of our Senior
    Notes. These costs were capitalized and are amortized to
    interest expense over the lives of the related facility and the
    Senior Notes. At December 31, 2009, total unamortized debt
    issuance costs were $11.7 million.

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We are exposed to certain market risks relating to our ongoing
    business operations, including foreign currency risk, commodity
    price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. We manage our
    exposure to these and other market risks through regular
    operating and financing activities. Currently, the only risk
    that we manage through the use of derivative instruments is
    foreign currency risk.

(Continued)

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
    could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates. To reduce the potential effects of foreign
    currency exchange rate movements on net earnings, we enter into
    derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency
    exchange forward contracts and options with major financial
    institutions. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency
    exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets
    denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British
    Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won and
    Swedish Krona. We do not use derivative financial instruments
    for trading or speculative purposes.

We report all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on
    the balance sheet at fair value.

Derivatives
    Designated as Hedging Instruments

Our revenues are generated in various currencies throughout the
    world. However, a significant amount of our inventory is
    produced in U.S. Dollars. Therefore, movements in foreign
    currency exchange rates may have different proportional effects
    on our revenues compared to our cost of products sold. To
    minimize the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements
    on cash flows, we hedge intercompany sales of inventory expected
    to occur within the next 30 months with foreign currency
    exchange forward contracts and options. We designate these
    derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. We have not entered
    into any derivative instruments designated as fair value or net
    investment in foreign operation hedges.

We perform quarterly assessments of hedge effectiveness by
    verifying and documenting the critical terms of the hedge
    instrument and that forecasted transactions have not changed
    significantly. We also assess on a quarterly basis whether there
    have been adverse developments regarding the risk of a
    counterparty default. For derivatives which qualify as hedges of
    future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair
    value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and
    then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item
    affects net earnings. The ineffective portion of a
    derivative’s change in fair value, if any, is reported in
    cost of products sold immediately. The net amount recognized in
    earnings during 2009 and 2008 due to ineffectiveness and amounts
    excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness was not
    significant.

For forward contracts and options outstanding at
    December 31, 2009, we have obligations to purchase
    U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds,
    Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won and Swedish
    Krona and purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at
    set maturity dates ranging from January 2010 through June 2012.
    The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts and
    options entered into with third parties to purchase
    U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2009 were
    $1.1 billion. The notional amounts of outstanding forward
    contracts entered into with third parties to purchase Swiss
    Francs at December 31, 2009 were $202 million.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, all derivative
    instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair
    value on the balance sheet. On our consolidated balance sheet,
    we recognize individual forward contracts and options with the
    same counterparty on a net asset/liability basis if we have a
    master netting agreement with the counterparty. The fair value
    of derivative instruments on a gross basis as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (in millions):

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary
    assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
    entity’s functional currency. As a result, any foreign
    currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are
    generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. These
    offsetting gains/losses are recorded in cost of products sold as
    the underlying assets and liabilities exposed to remeasurement
    include inventory-related transactions. These contracts are
    settled on the last day of each reporting period. Therefore,
    there is no outstanding balance related to these contracts
    recorded on the balance sheet as of the end of the reporting
    period. The notional amounts of these contracts are typically in
    a range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion per quarter.

The following gains/(losses) from these derivative instruments
    were recognized in cost of products sold on our consolidated

RETIREMENT
    BENEFIT PLANS

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain
    U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. The employees who are not
    participating in the defined benefit plans receive additional
    benefits under our defined contribution plans. Plan benefits are
    primarily based on years of credited service and the
    participant’s average eligible compensation. In addition to
    the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit pension plans, we
    sponsor various

non-U.S. pension

arrangements, including retirement and termination benefit plans
    required by local law or coordinated with government sponsored
    plans.

We use a December 31 measurement date for our benefit plans.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on
    the historical and estimated future rates of return on the
    different asset classes held in the plans. The expected
    long-term rate of return is the weighted average of the target
    asset allocation of each individual asset class. We believe that
    historical asset results approximate expected market returns
    applicable to the funding of a long-term benefit obligation.

Discount rates were determined for each of our defined benefit
    retirement plans at their measurement date to reflect the yield
    of a portfolio of high quality bonds matched against the timing
    and amounts of projected future benefit payments.

The U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement
    plans’ overall investment strategy is to maximize total
    returns by emphasizing long-term growth of capital while
    avoiding risk. We have established target ranges of assets held
    by the plans of 50 to 75 percent for equity securities and
    25 to 50 percent for debt securities. The plans strive to
    have sufficiently diversified assets so that adverse or
    unexpected results from one asset class will not have an unduly
    detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. The investments in
    the plans may be rebalanced quarterly based upon the target
    asset allocation of the plans.

In the U.S. and Puerto Rico, we maintain an investment
    policy statement that guides the investment allocation in the
    plans. The investment policy statement describes the target
    asset allocation positions described above. We have a benefits
    committee to manage the general philosophy, objectives and
    process of the plans. The benefits committee meets quarterly to
    review performance and to ensure that the current investment
    allocation is within the guidelines set forth in the investment
    policy statement.

The investment strategies of

non-U.S. based

plans vary according to the plan provisions and local laws. The
    majority of the assets in

non-U.S. based

plans are located in Switzerland based plans. These assets are
    held in trusts and are commingled with the assets of other Swiss
    companies with representatives of all the companies making the
    investment decisions. The overall strategy is to maximize total
    returns while avoiding risk. The trustees of the assets have
    established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 30 to
    50 percent in debt securities, 20 to 37 percent in
    equity

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our defined benefit
    pension plans’ assets did not hold any direct investment in
    Zimmer Holdings common stock.

Equity securities are valued using a market approach, based on
    quoted prices for the specific security from transactions in
    active exchange markets (Level 1), or in some cases where
    we are invested in mutual or collective funds, based upon the
    net asset value per unit of the fund which is determined from
    quoted market prices of the underlying securities in the
    fund’s portfolio (Level 2). Fixed income securities
    are valued using a market approach, based upon quoted prices for
    the specific security or from institutional bid evaluations.
    Some fixed income securities are in funds with a net asset value
    per unit which is determined using similar techniques for the
    underlying securities in the fund’s portfolio. Real estate
    is valued by discounting to present value the cash flows
    expected to be generated by the specific properties.

The value of Level 3 assets has not changed significantly
    from the prior year. Further information related to Level 3
    assets has not been provided as we do not consider the
    Level 3 assets significant to the consolidated financial
    statements.

We expect that we will have no minimum funding requirements by
    law in 2010 for the qualified U.S. and Puerto Rico defined
    benefit retirement plans, however, subsequent Congressional
    action may impact the minimum funding requirement for 2010. We
    expect to voluntarily contribute between $20 million to
    $30 million to these plans during 2010. Contributions to

non-U.S. defined

benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $14 million
    in 2010. We do not expect the plan assets in any of our plans to
    be returned to us in the next year.

Defined
    Contribution Plans

We also sponsor defined contribution plans for substantially all
    of the U.S. and Puerto Rico employees and certain employees
    in other countries. The benefits of these plans relate to local
    customs and practices in the countries concerned. We expensed
    $21.6 million, $17.1 million and $14.0 million
    related to these plans for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Postretirement
    Benefit Plans

During 2009 we amended the postretirement benefit plans for
    certain U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. Participants in the
    plan between the ages of 55 and 65 that were previously
    receiving benefits will continue to receive benefits until
    reaching the age of 65. For all other participants in the plan,
    no benefits will be paid after January 1, 2010.
    Additionally, we funded approximately $7 million to a
    Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust
    to settle any future obligations. We recognized a curtailment
    gain and settlement loss related to these actions.

Our operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland and the State of
    Indiana benefit from various tax incentive grants. Unless these
    grants are extended, they will expire between fiscal years 2016
    and 2019.

In September 2007, we reached a settlement with the
    U.S. government concerning our financial relationships with
    consulting orthopaedic surgeons. Under the terms of the
    settlement, we paid a civil settlement amount of
    $169.5 million, and we recorded an expense in that amount.
    At the time, no tax benefit was recorded related to the
    settlement expense due to the uncertainty as to the tax
    treatment. During the third quarter of 2008, we reached an
    agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    confirming the deductibility of a portion of the settlement
    payment. As a result, during 2008 we recorded a current tax
    benefit of $31.7 million.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
    used for income tax purposes. We have established valuation
    allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected
    future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the
    deduction or credit.

The net operating loss carryovers are available to reduce future
    federal, state and foreign taxable earnings. At
    December 31, 2009, these net operating loss carryovers
    generally expire within a period of 1 to 20 years.
    Valuation allowances for net operating loss carryovers have been
    established in the amount of $13.2 million and
    $18.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The tax credit carryovers are available to offset
    future federal, state and foreign tax liabilities. At
    December 31, 2009, these tax credit carryovers generally
    expire within a period of 1 to 15 years. We have
    established valuation allowances for certain tax credit
    carryovers in the amount of $17.9 million and
    $12.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The remaining valuation allowances of
    $6.2 million and $5.3 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, relate primarily to potential
    capital losses. We have established valuation allowances related
    to certain business combination transactions through goodwill.
    These allowances were approximately $14.5 million and
    $19.3 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

At December 31, 2009, we had an aggregate of approximately
    $1,835 million of unremitted earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries that have been, or are intended to be, indefinitely
    reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. If the total
    undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted, a
    significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the
    allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practical for us to
    determine the additional tax of remitting these earnings.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2009 are $100.4 million of tax benefits
    that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense and accrued
    interest and penalties of $5.7 million during 2009, and as
    of December 31, 2009, had recognized a liability for
    interest and penalties of $28.6 million. During 2008, we
    accrued interest and penalties of $3.3 million, and as of
    December 31, 2008, had recognized a liability for interest
    and penalties of $22.9 million. During 2007, we accrued
    interest and penalties of $10.0 million, and as of
    December 31, 2007, had recognized a liability for interest
    and penalties of $19.6 million.

We expect that the net amount of tax liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits will change in the next twelve months. We are
    currently under audit in numerous federal, state and foreign
    jurisdictions. While it is possible that such matters will be
    resolved in the next twelve months, we cannot reasonably
    estimate the amount or the periods in which changes in the
    unrecognized tax benefits will occur.

During the third quarter of 2009, we settled various tax matters
    with the IRS for all years prior to 2005. Our U.S. federal
    returns for years 2005 through 2007 are currently under IRS
    examination.

State income tax returns are generally subject to examination
    for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective
    return. The state impact of any federal changes generally
    remains subject to examination by various states for a period of
    up to one year after formal notification to the states. We have
    various state income tax returns in the process of examination,
    administrative appeals or litigation.

Our tax returns are currently under examination in various
    foreign jurisdictions. Foreign jurisdictions have statutes of
    limitations generally ranging from 3 to 5 years. Years
    still open to examination by foreign tax authorities in major
    jurisdictions include: Australia (2004 onward), Canada (2003
    onward), France (2007 onward), Germany (2005 onward), Italy
    (2005 onward), Japan (2003 onward), Korea (2004 onward), Puerto
    Rico (2005 onward), Singapore (2003 onward), Switzerland (2006
    onward) and the United Kingdom (2008 onward).

CAPITAL STOCK AND
    EARNINGS PER SHARE

We are authorized to issue 250 million shares of preferred
    stock, none of which were issued or outstanding as of
    December 31, 2009.

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is
    net earnings available to common stockholders. The denominator
    for basic earnings per share is the weighted average number of
    common shares outstanding during the period. The denominator for
    diluted earnings per share is weighted average shares
    outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options
    and other equity awards. The following is a reconciliation of
    weighted average shares for the basic and diluted share
    computations for the years ending December 31 (in millions):

For the year ended December 31, 2009, an average of
    14.3 million options to purchase shares of common stock
    were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
    share as the exercise prices of these options were greater than
    the average market price of the common stock. For the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, an average of
    11.2 million and 3.1 million options, respectively,
    were not included.

During 2009, we repurchased approximately 19.8 million
    shares of our common stock at an average price of $46.56 per
    share for a total cash outlay of $923.7 million, including
    commissions. In April 2008, we announced that our Board of
    Directors authorized a $1.25 billion share repurchase
    program which was originally set to expire on December 31,
    2009. In September 2009, the Board of Directors extended this
    program to December 31, 2010. Approximately
    $211.1 million remains authorized for future repurchases
    under this plan.

SEGMENT
    DATA

We design, develop, manufacture and market orthopaedic
    reconstructive implants, dental implants, spinal implants,
    trauma products and related surgical products which include
    surgical supplies and instruments designed to aid in surgical
    procedures and post-operation rehabilitation. We also provide
    other healthcare-related services. Revenue related to these
    services currently represents less than 1 percent of our
    total net sales. We manage operations through three major
    geographic segments – the Americas, which is comprised
    principally of the United States and includes other North,
    Central and South American markets; Europe, which is comprised
    principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and Africa;
    and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan and
    includes other Asian and Pacific markets. This structure is the
    basis for our reportable segment information discussed below.
    Management evaluates reportable segment performance based upon
    segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses
    pertaining to global operations and corporate expenses,
    share-based compensation expense, settlement, certain claims,
    acquisition, integration, realignment and other expenses, net
    curtailment and settlement, inventory

step-up,

in-process research and development write-offs and intangible
    asset amortization expense. Global operations include research,
    development engineering, medical education, brand management,
    corporate legal, finance, and human resource functions and
    U.S. and Puerto Rico-based manufacturing operations and
    logistics. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated from
    segment operating profit. Management reviews accounts
    receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, goodwill
    and intangible assets by reportable segment exclusive of U.S.
    and Puerto Rico-based manufacturing operations and logistics and
    corporate assets.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES

Intellectual
    Property and Product Liability-Related Litigation

In July 2008, we temporarily suspended marketing and
    distribution of the

Durom

®

Acetabular Component (

Durom

Cup) in the
    U.S. Following our announcement, product liability lawsuits
    and other claims have been asserted against us, some of which we
    have settled. There are a number of claims still pending, and
    additional claims may be submitted. We recorded a provision of
    $69.0 million in 2008, representing management’s
    estimate of these

Durom

Cup-related claims. In the third
    quarter of 2009, based on claims information we received after
    we made our initial estimate, we increased our estimate of the
    number of claims we may receive and increased the provision by
    $35.0 million. The current reserve is $71.9 million as
    of December 31, 2009. We expect to pay the majority of
    these claims within the next three years. The provision is
    limited to revisions within two years of an original surgery
    that occurred prior to July 2008. Any claims received outside of
    these defined parameters will be managed in the normal course
    and reflected in our standard product liability accruals.

On February 15, 2005, Howmedica Osteonics Corp. filed an
    action against us and an unrelated party in the United States
    District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging
    infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934; 6,372,814;
    6,664,308; and 6,818,020. On June 13, 2007, the Court
    granted our motion for summary judgment on the invalidity of the
    asserted claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934; 6,372,814;
    and 6,664,308 by ruling that all of the asserted claims are
    invalid for indefiniteness. On August 19, 2008, the Court
    granted our motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of
    certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,818,020, reducing
    the number of claims at issue in the suit to five. On
    April 9, 2009, in response to our earlier petition, the
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office instituted re-examination
    proceedings against U.S. Patent No. 6,818,020. The
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected all previously
    issued claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,818,020 as being
    unpatentable in light of one or more prior art references. On
    September 30, 2009, the Court issued an order staying
    proceedings in the litigation pending the outcome of the
    re-examination process. Subsequent to that stay order, Howmedica
    filed a motion seeking to certify an appeal of the summary
    judgment ruling on the ’934, ’814 and ’308
    patents. That motion was granted on January 13, 2010. We
    expect that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
    Circuit will hear the appeal of that ruling in 2010. We continue
    to believe that our defenses against infringement are valid and
    meritorious, and we intend to continue to defend this lawsuit
    vigorously.

In addition to certain claims related to the

Durom

Cup
    within the parameters discussed above, we are also subject to
    product liability and other claims and lawsuits arising in the
    ordinary course of business, for which we maintain insurance,
    subject to self-insured retention limits. We establish accruals
    for product liability and other claims in conjunction with
    outside counsel based on current information and historical
    settlement information for open claims, related legal fees and
    claims incurred but not reported. While it is not possible to
    predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the
    opinion of management that, upon ultimate resolution,
    liabilities from these cases in excess of those recorded, if
    any, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Government
    Investigations

In September 2007, we and other orthopaedic companies settled a
    U.S. government investigation pertaining to consulting
    contracts, professional services agreements and other agreements
    by which remuneration is provided to orthopaedic surgeons. As
    part of the settlement, we entered into a Corporate Integrity
    Agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General of the
    Department of Health and Human Services (OIG-HHS). Under the
    CIA, which has a term expiring in 2012, we agreed, among other
    provisions, to continue the operation of our enhanced Corporate
    Compliance Program, designed to promote compliance with federal
    healthcare program requirements, in accordance with the terms
    set forth in the CIA. We also agreed to retain an independent
    review organization to perform annual reviews to assist us in
    assessing our compliance with the obligations set forth in the
    CIA to ensure that arrangements we enter into do not violate the
    Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C.

§ 1320a-7b).

A material breach of the CIA may subject us to exclusion by
    OIG-HHS from participation in all federal healthcare programs,
    which would have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

In November 2007, we received a civil investigative demand from
    the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office

(Continued)

seeking additional information regarding our financial
    relationships with a number of Massachusetts healthcare
    providers. We received a similar inquiry from the Oregon
    Attorney General’s office in October 2008. We are
    cooperating fully with the investigators with regard to these
    matters.

In September 2007, the Staff of the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission (SEC) informed us that it was conducting an
    investigation regarding potential violations of the Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in the sale of medical devices in a
    number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device
    industry. In November 2007, we received a letter from the
    U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting that any
    information provided to the SEC also be provided to the DOJ on a
    voluntary basis. We are continuing to provide information and
    cooperate fully with the SEC and the DOJ with regard to this
    pending investigation. In addition, as part of our global
    compliance program, we have been conducting our own proactive
    reviews regarding FCPA compliance in jurisdictions that have not
    been involved in the pending investigation. These reviews have
    yielded information indicating that certain third-party,
    independent distributors of our products in two South American
    countries made certain payments that may have potential FCPA
    implications. In the course of continuing dialogues with the
    agencies, we voluntarily disclosed information relating to these
    matters to the SEC and the DOJ, and the reviews are ongoing. We
    cannot currently predict the outcome of the investigation or the
    impact of our voluntary disclosures to the authorities.

Putative
    Class Actions

On August 5, 2008, a complaint was filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana,
    Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union 719 Pension Fund v.
    Zimmer Holdings, Inc., et al., naming us and two of our
    executive officers as defendants. The complaint related to a
    putative class action on behalf of persons who purchased our
    common stock between January 29, 2008 and July 22,
    2008. The complaint alleged that the defendants violated the
    federal securities law by allegedly failing to disclose
    developments relating to our orthopaedic surgical products
    manufacturing operations in Dover, Ohio and the

Durom

Cup. The plaintiff sought unspecified damages and interest,
    attorneys’ fees, costs and other relief. On
    December 24, 2008, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated
    complaint that alleged the same claims and related to the same
    time period. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
    consolidated complaint on February 23, 2009. On
    December 1, 2009, the Court granted defendants’ motion
    to dismiss, without prejudice. On January 15, 2010, the
    plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend the consolidated
    complaint. That motion is pending. We believe this lawsuit is
    without merit, and we and the individual defendants intend to
    defend it vigorously.

On November 20, 2008, a complaint was filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,
    Dewald v. Zimmer Holdings, Inc., et al., naming us and
    certain of our current and former directors and employees as
    defendants. The complaint relates to a putative class action on
    behalf of all persons who were participants in or beneficiaries
    of our U.S. or Puerto Rico Savings and Investment Programs
    (plans) between October 5, 2007 and the date of filing and
    whose accounts included investments in our common stock. The
    complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants
    breached their fiduciary duties in violation of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, by
    continuing to offer Zimmer stock as an investment option in the
    plans when the stock purportedly was no longer a prudent
    investment and that defendants failed to provide plan
    participants with complete and accurate information sufficient
    to advise them of the risks of investing their retirement
    savings in Zimmer stock. The plaintiff seeks an unspecified
    monetary payment to the plans, injunctive and equitable relief,
    attorneys’ fees, costs and other relief. On
    January 23, 2009, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint
    that alleges the same claims and clarifies that the class period
    is October 5, 2007 through September 2, 2008. The
    defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on
    March 23, 2009. The motion to dismiss is pending with the
    court. On June 12, 2009, the U.S. Judicial Panel on
    Multidistrict Litigation entered an order transferring the
    Dewald case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of Indiana for coordinated or consolidated pretrial
    proceedings with the Plumbers & Pipefitters Local
    Union 719 Pension Fund case referenced above. We believe this
    lawsuit is without merit, and we and the individual defendants
    intend to defend it vigorously.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures and
    internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable
    assurance that material information relating to us, including
    our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known on a timely basis
    to management and the Board of Directors. However, no control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are
    met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within a company have been detected.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
    of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that
    evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as
    of the end of the period covered by this report are effective.

There was no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred
    during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
    Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting appears in this report at the conclusion of
    Part II, Item 7A.

ITEM 9B.

Other Information

During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors was not asked to and did not approve the
    engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent
    registered public accounting firm, to perform any non-audit
    services. This disclosure is made pursuant to
    Section 10A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    as added by Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
