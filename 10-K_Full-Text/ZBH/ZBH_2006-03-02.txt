ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

GENERAL

We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture
and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants, including
joint and dental, spinal implants, trauma products and related
orthopaedic surgical products. In this report,
“Zimmer” “we”, “us”,
“our” and similar words refer collectively to Zimmer
Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to
the parent company only.

Zimmer Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2001.
Zimmer’s history dates to 1927, when Zimmer Manufacturing
Company, a predecessor, was founded in Warsaw, Indiana. On
August 6, 2001, Zimmer Holdings was spun off from its
former parent and became an independent public company.

In October 2003, we finalized our acquisition of Centerpulse AG
(“Centerpulse”), a Switzerland-based orthopaedics
company and the leader in the European reconstructive market. In
addition to providing us with a leading position in the European
orthopaedic reconstructive implant market, the Centerpulse
acquisition furnished us with a platform in the faster growing
spine and dental implant markets.

In April 2004, we acquired Implex Corp. (“Implex”),
now known as Zimmer Trabecular Metal Technology, Inc., a company
with which we had a distribution and strategic alliance since
2000 for the commercialization of reconstructive implant and
trauma products incorporating

Trabecular
Metal

tm

Technology.

Throughout the past two years, a key focus of management has
been the successful integration of the Centerpulse and Implex
businesses. In 2005, we performed ahead of schedule under our
comprehensive integration plan, having accomplished almost
90 percent of the more than 3,500 total planned integration
milestones.

CUSTOMERS, SALES AND MARKETING

Our primary customers include musculoskeletal surgeons,
neurosurgeons, oral surgeons, dentists, hospitals, distributors,
healthcare dealers and, in their capacity as agents, healthcare
purchasing organizations or buying groups. These customers range
from large multinational enterprises to independent surgeons.

We have operations in more than 24 countries and market products
in more than 100 countries, with corporate headquarters in
Warsaw, Indiana, and more than 100 manufacturing, distribution
and warehousing and/or office facilities worldwide. We manage
our operations through three major geographic
segments – the Americas, which is comprised
principally of the United States and includes other North,
Central and South American markets; Europe, which is comprised
principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and Africa;
and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan and
includes other Asian and Pacific markets. Detailed financial and
other information regarding our reportable geographic segments
can be found in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are included in this report under Item 8.

We market and sell products through three principal channels:
1) direct to health care institutions, such as hospitals,
which is referred to as a direct channel account,
2) through stocking distributors and, in the Asia Pacific
region, healthcare dealers, and 3) directly to dental
practices and dental laboratories. Through the direct channel
accounts, inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or
customers so that products are available when needed for
surgical procedures. With the sales to stocking distributors,
healthcare dealers, dental practices and dental laboratories,
title to product passes generally upon shipment. Direct channel
accounts represented more than 80 percent of our net sales
in 2005. No individual direct channel account, stocking
distributor, healthcare dealer, dental practice or dental
laboratory accounted for more than 10 percent of our net
sales for 2005.

We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title
to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products
are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock
levels are determined based on a number of factors, including
demand, manufacturing lead times and optimal quantities required
to maintain the highest possible service levels. We also carry
trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that
are generally consistent with local market practices.

We utilize a network of sales associates, sales managers and
support personnel, most of whom are employed by independent
distributors and sales agencies. We invest a significant amount
of time and expense in providing training in such areas as
product features and benefits, how to use specific products and
how to best inform surgeons of such features and uses. Sales
force representatives rely heavily on strong technical selling
skills, medical education and the ability to provide technical
support for surgeons.

In response to the different healthcare systems throughout the
world, our sales and marketing strategies and organizational
structures differ by region. We utilize a global approach to
sales force training, marketing and medical education into each
locality to provide consistent, high quality service.
Additionally, we keep current with key surgical developments and
other issues related to musculoskeletal surgeons and the medical
procedures they perform, in part through sponsorship of medical
education events. In 2005, we sponsored more than 300 medical
education events and meetings with and among musculoskeletal
surgeons around the world.

Americas.

The Americas is the largest geographic segment,
accounting for $1,941.8 million, or 59 percent, of
2005 net sales, with the United States accounting for
$1,845.6 million of net sales in this region. The United
States sales force consists of independent sales agents, together



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

with sales associates, sales managers and sales support
personnel, the majority of which sell products exclusively for
Zimmer. Sales agents in the United States receive a commission
on product sales and are responsible for many operating
decisions and costs. Sales commissions are accrued at the time
of sale.

In this region, we have also concentrated on negotiating
contracts with purchasing organizations or buying groups and
managed care accounts and have increased unit growth by linking
the level of discounts received to volume of purchases by
customer health care institutions within a specified group. At
negotiated thresholds within a contract buying period, price
discounts increase. Under these buying contracts, we are
generally designated as one of several identified preferred
purchasing sources for the members of the buying group for
specified products, although usually the members are not
obligated to purchase our products.

A majority of hospitals in the United States belong to at least
one group purchasing organization. In 2005, individual hospital
orders purchased through contractual arrangements with such
purchasing organizations or buying groups accounted for
approximately 51 percent of our net sales in the United
States. Contractual sales were highest through Novation, LLC,
Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P., and Health
Trust Purchasing Group, representing 29 percent,
13 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of net sales
in the United States. No individual end-user, however, accounted
for over 1 percent of our net sales, and the top ten
end-users accounted for approximately 3.7 percent of our
aggregate net sales in the United States. These buying contracts
generally have a term of three years with extensions as
warranted. Our current arrangements with Premier, Novation and
Health Trust Purchasing Group have all been renegotiated
and updated in the past 24 months.

In the Americas, we maintain an extensive monitoring and
incentive system ranking sales agents across a range of
performance metrics. We evaluate and reward sales agents based
on achieving certain sales targets and on maintaining efficient
levels of working capital. We set expectations for efficient
management of inventory and provide sales agents an incentive to
aid in the collection of receivables.

Europe.

The European geographic segment accounted for
$874.8 million, or 27 percent, of 2005 net sales,
with France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom collectively accounting for more than 79 percent of
net sales in the region. In addition, we also operate in other
key markets such as Benelux, Nordic, Central and Eastern Europe,
the Middle East and Africa. Our sales force in this region is
comprised of independent distributors, commissioned agents,
direct sales associates and sales support personnel. In
marketing our orthopaedic implant portfolio in Europe, we have
continued to emphasize the advantages of clinically proven,
established designs.

Asia Pacific.

The Asia Pacific geographic segment
accounted for $469.5 million, or 14 percent of
2005 net sales, with Japan being the largest market within
this segment, accounting for approximately 60 percent of
the sales in this region. In addition, we operate in key markets
such as Australia, New Zealand, Korea, China, Greater China,
India, Thailand and Singapore. In Japan and most countries in
the Asia Pacific region, we maintain a network of dealers who
act principally as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the
region, together with sales associates who build and maintain
strong relationships with musculoskeletal surgeons in their
markets. These sales associates cover over 7,000 hospitals in
the region. The knowledge and skills of our sales associates
play a critical role in providing service, product information
and support to surgeons who continue to enhance their knowledge
and skills to improve the quality of surgical outcomes. We have
strengthened, and intend to continue to support the clinical
needs of surgeons in the region primarily through sponsorship of
medical education and training programs relating to orthopaedic
surgery. The key marketing and educational activities in the
region center on minimally invasive surgical procedures and
technologies, increased range of motion and improved patient
outcomes.

Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, many
of our products are used in elective procedures, which typically
decline during the summer months and holiday seasons.

DISTRIBUTION

We generally ship our orders via expedited courier. Our
operations support local language labeling for shipments to the
European Union member countries. We operate distribution
facilities, among other places, in Warsaw, Indiana; Dover, Ohio;
Statesville, North Carolina; Memphis, Tennessee; Carlsbad,
California; and internationally in Australia, Belgium, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands,
Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Our
backlog of firm orders is not considered material to an
understanding of our business.

PRODUCTS

We design, develop, manufacture and market reconstructive
orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal
implants, trauma products, and related orthopaedic surgical
products. Reconstructive orthopaedic implants restore joint
function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees,
hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants
restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth
due to trauma or disease. Spinal implants are utilized by
orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of
degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in all regions of
the spine. Trauma products are devices used primarily to
reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the
body’s natural healing process. Our related orthopaedic
surgical products include supplies and instruments designed to
aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation
rehabilitation. Information about product sales can be found in
Item 7 of this report.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Orthopaedic Reconstructive Implants

The majority of reconstructive implant procedures restore joint
function lost due to degenerative diseases such as arthritis and
relieve pain in knees and hips.

Minimally Invasive Solutions
    Procedures and Technologies

In 2005, we continued to expand our efforts to apply minimally
invasive surgical techniques to orthopaedic surgery, which we
refer to as

Minimally Invasive
Solutions

tm

(

MIS

tm

)
Procedures and Technologies. The Zimmer Institute, with its main
facility located at our global headquarters, has been used, in
addition to satellite centers established in connection with 25
existing Zimmer Institute partnerships, to facilitate the
training of over 4,000 surgeons on several

MIS

Procedures. In 2005 alone, we trained nearly 2,500 surgeons
through The Zimmer Institute network.

We work directly with several global medical centers to evaluate
and refine advanced minimally invasive knee and hip replacement
procedures. We plan to continue to affiliate with additional
North American and international institutions to provide surgeon
education at The Zimmer Institute and its satellite locations.
The principal goals of these

MIS

Technology efforts are
to reduce the hardships of having a total joint replacement,
such as the time a patient must spend in rehabilitation, pain
reduction and lost time from work.

In December 2005, we announced that we are following more than
2,500

Zimmer

®

MIS

2-Incision

tm

Total Hip Replacement Procedure cases in active clinical
studies. We estimate that in total more than 3,000 of these
procedures have been performed worldwide since inception in
2001. At the February 2005 American Academy of Orthopaedic
Surgeons meeting in Washington, D.C., we introduced the

Zimmer MIS

Anterolateral Hip Replacement Procedure that
was developed with the specific intent to expand patient
benefits relative to standard hip replacement surgery. Among our
achievements in

MIS

Procedures and Technologies in knees
during 2005, we began commercializing the

NexGen

®

MIS

Tibial Plate, the first modular stemmed tibial
component prosthesis that can be assembled within the patient,
making it more conducive to minimally invasive procedures.

Throughout 2005, we continued to develop navigation systems,
through the use of image-guided surgical technology, to aid
surgeons in learning procedures and gaining confidence in the
placement of instrumentation and implants where navigation is
difficult due to the small incisions necessary in effectuating
minimally invasive procedures. In February 2005, we announced
that the first electromagnetic CAS-enabled knee replacement
procedures were successfully performed in Houston, Texas.
Orthopaedic surgeons are now performing these navigation
procedures in association with the

Zimmer MIS
Quad-Sparing

tm

Total Knee Replacement Procedure and the

Zimmer MIS

Mini-Incision Total Knee Procedure.

We are focused both on further commercializing existing

MIS

Technique approaches and investigating new ways to apply

MIS

Technology principles to additional procedures and
products. We continue to believe that the commitment of
substantial financial and other resources in furtherance of

MIS

Procedures and Technologies is critical.

Knee Implants

Total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral
component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an
articulating surface (placed on the tibial tray). Knee
replacement surgeries include first-time joint replacement
procedures and revision procedures for the replacement, repair
or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous
procedure. Knee implants are designed to accommodate different
levels of ligament stabilization of the joint. While some knee
implant designs, called cruciate retaining (CR) designs, require
the retention of the posterior cruciate ligament, other designs,
called posterior stabilized (PS) designs, provide joint
stability without the posterior cruciate ligament. There are
also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee, which
treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of
only one side or compartment of the knee with an
unicompartmental knee prosthesis.

Our portfolio of

MIS

Techniques includes the

MIS

Mini-Incision Total Knee Procedures and the

MIS
Quad-Sparing

Total Knee Replacement Procedure, with the
incorporation of CAS-enabled electromagnetic navigation
capability. The

MIS

Mini-Incision Total Knee Instruments
feature smaller instruments which accommodate a smaller incision
and less disruption of the surrounding soft tissues. The

MIS
Quad-Sparing

Total Knee Procedure features advanced
instrument concepts which allow surgeons to perform the total
knee arthroplasty through a 7-10 cm incision without cutting the
patient’s muscles or tendons.

We offer a wide range of products for specialized knee
procedures, including, among others, the following brands:

NexGen

®

Complete Knee Solution. The

NexGen

Knee product line is a
comprehensive system for knee replacement surgery which has had
significant application in PS, CR and revision procedures. The

NexGen

Knee System offers joint stability and sizing that
can be tailored to individual patient needs while providing
surgeons with a unified system of interchangeable components.
The

NexGen

Knee System provides surgeons with complete
and versatile knee instrument options, including

Zimmer MIS
Quad-Sparing

and

MIS

Mini-Incision Instruments,
milling and multiple traditional saw blade cutting instrument
systems. The breadth and versatility of the

NexGen

Knee
System allows surgeons to change from one type of implant to
another during surgery, according to the needs of the patient,
and to support current surgical philosophies. The ongoing use of

Trabecular Metal

Monoblock Tibial Components in both CR
and PS philosophies enhances our strategy to add new innovative
technologies to this brand.

Trabecular Metal

Materials
provide a higher level of porosity and surface friction than
existing non-cemented alternatives and are similar in stiffness
to natural bone.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

The

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution

Legacy

®

Knee-Posterior Stabilized product line provides stability in the
absence of the posterior cruciate ligament. The PS capabilities
were augmented through the introduction of the

NexGen Legacy

Posterior Stabilized Flex Knee (the “LPS-Flex
Knee”), a high-flexion implant that has the potential to
accommodate knee flexion up to a 155-degree range of motion in
some patients.

The

NexGen

CR product line is designed to be used in
conjunction with a functioning posterior cruciate ligament. The

NexGen

CR-Flex Fixed Bearing Knee was added to the
product line in 2003 and is designed with components to provide
a greater range of motion for patients who require deep bending
in their daily activities. The

NexGen

CR-Flex Femoral
Components allow the surgeon to adjust component sizing without
removing additional bone.

The

NexGen

Revision Knee product line consists of several
different products that are designed to provide clinical
solutions to surgeons for various revision situations. In 2004,
we commercialized a new bone augmentation implant system made
from

Trabecular Metal

Technology material. These new
augments are designed to address significant bone loss in
revision surgery.

We offer improved polyethylene performance in the

NexGen

Knee System with our conventional polyethylene and

Prolong

tm

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene, which represents an advance in
a number of wear related areas including reduction in wear,
resistance to oxidation, pitting, cracking and is the only

is best known for its mobile bearing knee offering, the
availability of differing levels of articular constraint and the

Innex

Revision Knee components provide for a
comprehensive mobile and fixed bearing knee system. The

Innex

Knee System is currently distributed in Europe and Asia
Pacific, but is not available for commercial distribution in the
United States.

Unicompartmental Knee Systems.

The

M/

Unicompartmental Knee Systems apply the same flexibility and
quality of our other knee implant products to unicompartmental,
or single compartment disease. These systems offer the surgeon
the ability to conserve bone by replacing only the compartment
of the knee that has had degenerative changes.

The

Zimmer

®

Unicompartmental Knee System was commercialized in 2004 offering
a high flexion design to unicompartmental knee surgery. The high
flexion product was designed specifically for

MIS

Procedures and Technologies.

Hip Implants

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the
femur and the socket portion of the pelvis (acetabulum) of the
natural hip. Hip procedures include first time, or primary,
joint replacement as well as revision procedures for the
replacement, repair or enhancement of an implant product or
component from a previous procedure. Approximately
40 percent of the hip implant procedures involve the use of
bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the
surrounding bone. The remaining balance of the total hip
replacement procedures are press-fit into bone, which means that
they have a surface that bone affixes to through either ongrowth
or ingrowth technologies.

Our portfolio of

MIS

Techniques includes the

Zimmer
MIS 2-Incision

Hip Replacement Procedure, the Mini-Incision
Posterior Procedure, the Mini-Incision Anterior Procedure, and
the

Zimmer MIS

Anterolateral Techniques. The incision for
a traditional open hip primary replacement may be approximately
12 inches long. Other less invasive approaches, such as a
“mini” incision for hips, have been in existence for
approximately seven years. In January 2004, the first computer
image-guided

MIS 2-Incision

Hip Replacement Procedure
live surgery was performed utilizing new technology and
instrumentation co-developed by us and our

MIS

Technologies computer navigation partner, Medtronic, Inc. In
January 2004, the United States Patent and Trademark Office
granted us a patent specific to our

MIS

2-Incision

Hip Replacement Procedure.

Our key hip replacement products include, among others:

VerSys

®

Hip System. The

VerSys

Hip System is supported by a
common instrumentation set and is an integrated family of hip
products that offers surgeons design-specific options to meet
varying surgical philosophies and patient needs. The

VerSys

Hip System includes the following features: a variety of
stem designs and fixation options for both primary and revision
situations, a modular design that allows for a variety of
femoral heads, optimal sizing selections, and a common
instrumentation set for use with virtually all

VerSys

Stems.

Zimmer

®

M/ L Taper Prosthesis. The

Zimmer

M/ L Taper Prosthesis
was launched in early 2004. The prosthesis offers a dual wedge
and proximally porous coated design that was based on long term
clinically proven concepts. The M/ L Taper has become widely
used in

MIS

Procedures due to its overall design and ease
of use. Specific instruments have

Hip System. The

Alloclassic (Zweymüller)

Hip
System has become the most used, primary, cementless hip in the
world. This is one of the few stems available today that is
practically unchanged since its introduction in 1979. A new
offset design was added in 2004 and offers the surgeon increased
capability to restore the patient’s anatomical joint
movement.

CLS

®

Spotorno

®

Hip System. The

CLS Spotorno

Stem is one of our largest
selling hip prostheses, especially in the European markets.
Additions to the product line in 2004 provided the capability
for restoration of the physiological center of rotation. The

CLS Spotorno

Stem has excellent clinical results,
confirmed by the 2004 Swedish Hip Registry with a
100 percent implant survivorship after 11 years.

Trilogy

®

Acetabular System. The

Trilogy

Acetabular System,
including titanium alloy shells, polyethylene liners, screws and
instruments, is our primary acetabular cup system. The

Trilogy

family of products offers patients and surgeons
options and versatile component designs and instrumentation. One
option, the

Longevity

®

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liner, is designed to address
the issue of wear and reduce the generation of debris in total
hip arthroplasty. Polyethylene debris may cause the degeneration
of bone surrounding reconstructive implants, a painful condition
called osteolysis. We continue to augment our offerings of
porous reconstructive hip implants through the introduction of

Trabecular Metal

Technology. We completed the launch of
the

Trabecular Metal

Modular Primary Acetabular System in
2004. This particular product incorporates design features from
the

Trilogy

family of acetabular shells augmented with
the advanced fixation surface of

Trabecular Metal

Material. In addition to the

Trabecular Metal

Acetabular System, we also offer a

Trabecular Metal

Revision Acetabular Shell for advanced fixation in
acetabulae with insufficient bone.

Alternative Bearing Technology.

We have a broad portfolio
of alternative bearing technologies which include

Longevity

and

Durasul

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylenes,

Metasul

®

Metal-on

-Metal
Tribological Solution and

Cerasul

®

and

Trilogy
AB

®

Ceramic-on

-Ceramic
Tribological Solutions. Alternative bearings are designed to
minimize wear over time, potentially increasing the longevity of
the implant. In December 2005, we announced that we received an
approvable letter from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) related to the

Trilogy AB

Acetabular System. The letter specified that the Premarket
Approval Application (PMA) is approvable subject to an FDA
inspection of our relevant facilities. We expect that the
necessary inspections will be completed in 2006 and that we will
begin marketing the

Trilogy AB

Acetabular System upon
final application approval from the FDA.

Durom

®

Hip Resurfacing System. This product is particularly suited to
patients who are at risk of requiring multiple hip replacements
over their lifetimes since it preserves the patient’s
healthy bone stock. A primary objective of this system is to
allow the patient to return to an active lifestyle. The

Durom

System uses the highly wear resistant

Metasul

Metal-on

-Metal
Technology as the bearing surface for the implant design. Since
1988,

Metasul

Technology has been used successfully for
total hip replacement. Today’s

metal-on

-metal
technology is the result of over one and a half decades of
development, research and clinical evaluation, which formed the
foundation for the

Durom

Hip Resurfacing System. The
option of the large diameter heads offers the advantage of a
low-wear solution while providing greater joint stability and
high range of motion in combination with the wide range of
cemented and uncemented femoral implants. We filed a 510(k) with
the FDA on the

Durom

Acetabular Shell and associated
large diameter

Metasul

Heads in December 2005.

Extremity Implants

Our extremity implants, primarily shoulder and elbow products,
are designed to treat arthritic conditions and fractures, as
well as to enhance the outcome of primary or revision surgery.

allograft bone and connective tissue while preserving the
extra-cellular matrix (collagen and mineral components).

Trauma

Trauma products include devices used primarily to stabilize
damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural
healing process. The most common surgical stabilization of bone
fracture involves the internal fixation of bone fragments. This
stabilization can involve the use of a wide assortment of
plates, screws, rods, wires and pins. In addition, external
fixation devices may be used to stabilize fractures or correct
deformities by applying them externally to the limb. We are
focusing on aligning our trauma products with

MIS

Procedures and on integrating orthobiologics and other
next-generation technologies into our trauma solutions.

In 2005, we formed a new standalone Zimmer Trauma division based
in Warsaw, Indiana. We offer a comprehensive line of trauma

cleaning and debridement of contaminants and foreign matter from
wounds using simultaneous irrigation and suction. All three

Pulsavac

Systems are completely disposable to reduce the
risk of cross contamination.

ORTHOBIOLOGICS

As part of our focused research and development efforts and
desire to create new orthopaedic treatments, we have an
Orthobiologics group based in Austin, Texas, with its own
full-time staff and dedicated projects. We are actively involved
in the field of orthobiologics and are committed to investing
extensively in orthobiologics research activities. We are
working on orthobiological solutions to repair and regenerate
damaged or degenerated orthopaedic tissues. These materials
potentially could transform treatment of damaged joints by
orthobiological repair rather than replacement with inert
materials. A sampling of some of our key projects in the
Orthobiologics area is set forth below.

We are collaborating with ISTO Technologies, Inc. (ISTO) on
a project to develop chondral and osteochondral cartilage grafts
for cartilage repair. ISTO is developing cartilage regeneration
and cell-based therapies using cartilage cells from juvenile
donor cartilage, with initial applications focused upon knee
joints and spinal discs. We led an ISTO financing round of
$10.8 million in 2005, which in part provides development
funds to ISTO. In 2006, we expect ISTO to move its neocartilage
products to U.S. Phase 1 human clinical trials for the
repair of articular cartilage.

In September 2005, we announced that we acquired worldwide
exclusive distribution rights for genetically engineered
xenogeneic porcine tissues for orthopaedic applications from
Revivicor, Inc., which has an advanced transgenic technology
platform for the production of tissues and cells. We are
centralizing our initial efforts on the development of
technologies for orthopaedic applications, including the repair
and replacement of damaged tendon, ligament, meniscus,
cartilage, bone and spinal nucleus tissues.

As mentioned above under the caption “Extremity
Implants”, in 2005, we launched an orthobiological patch
for the repair of rotator cuff injuries in the shoulder. The
underlying technology was developed by TSL and is being marketed
by us as the

Zimmer

Collagen Repair Patch.

We and our strategic partners are developing a biodegradable,
injectable hydrogel device designed to alleviate pain by
restoring the spinal nucleus to its original height through
rehydration.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We have extensive research and development activities to
introduce new surgical techniques, materials, orthobiologics and
product designs intended to advance the field of orthopaedics.
The product development function works closely with the
strategic brand marketing function to understand and respond to
our customers’ needs on a global basis, and with the
research function to incorporate new technologies in our product
pipeline. The rapid commercialization of innovative new
materials, orthobiologics products, implant and instrument
designs, and surgical techniques remains one of our core
strategies and continues to be an important driver of sales
growth.

Among the numerous new product launches in 2005, we released the
first

Trabecular Metal

Hip Stem, new

Durom

Hip
Resurfacing instruments, additional

Natural-Knee

instrument introductions in 2005 in the orthopaedic
reconstructive implants, spine implants, trauma, orthopaedic
surgical products and orthobiologics product categories are more
fully described above under the captions “PRODUCTS”
and “ORTHOBIOLOGICS”. These and other new products
introduced in the last three years accounted for more than
21 percent of 2005 total sales, exceeding our new products
sales goal of 15 to 20 percent of total sales on an annual
basis.

December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we spent
$175.5 million, $166.7 million and
$105.8 million, respectively, on research and development.
The substantial increases in research and development
expenditures have accelerated the output of new orthopaedic and
dental reconstructive implants, spine and trauma products,
including advanced new materials, product designs and surgical
techniques. Our primary research and development facility is
located in Warsaw, Indiana. In 2005, we announced that we are
committing $24 million to an expanded research and
development center in Warsaw and construction is underway. We
have other research and development personnel based in, among
other places, Winterthur, Switzerland; Austin, Texas;
Minneapolis, Minnesota; Carlsbad, California; Dover, Ohio; and
Cedar Knolls, New Jersey. As of December 31, 2005, we
employed more than 550 research and development employees
worldwide.

We will continue to identify innovative technologies and
consider acquiring complementary products or businesses, or
establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic
alliances.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND QUALITY SYSTEMS

We are subject to government regulation with regard to our
products and operations in the countries in which we conduct
business. It is our policy to comply with all regulatory
requirements governing our operations and products, and we
believe that the research, development, manufacturing and
quality control procedures that we employ are in material
compliance with all applicable regulations.

In the United States, numerous regulations govern the
development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and distribution
of medical devices, including, among others, the Federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations issued or promulgated
thereunder. The FDA regulates product safety and efficacy,
laboratory, clinical and manufacturing practices, labeling and
record keeping for medical devices and post market surveillance
to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. A
few of the devices we develop and market are in a category for
which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation
and pre-market approval requirements. The FDA has the authority
to halt the distribution of certain medical devices; detain or
seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; or order the
repair, replacement or refund of the costs of such devices.
There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign
governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and
marketing of our products.

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our
products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among
other things, clinical efficacy, design and product standards,
packaging requirements and labeling requirements. Many of the
regulations applicable to our devices and products in these
countries are similar to those of the FDA. The member countries
of the European Union have adopted the European Medical Device
Directives, which create a single set of medical device
regulations for all member countries. These regulations require
companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical
devices in European Union member countries to obtain CE Marks
for their products. We maintain a certified status with the
European and Canadian Notified Bodies, which provides for CE
marking of products for these markets.

We are subject to various government regulations pertaining to
healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and
physician self-referral laws. Violations of these laws are
punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in
some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the United
States, exclusion from participation in government healthcare
programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration
(VA) health programs and Civilian Health and Medical Program
Uniformed Service (CHAMPUS). The scope and enforcement of these
laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid change.
We believe that our operations are in material compliance with
these laws.

We are committed to providing high quality products to our
customers. To meet this commitment, we have implemented modern
quality systems and concepts throughout the organization. The
quality assurance department supervises our quality systems.
Senior management is actively involved in setting quality
policies and managing internal and external quality performance.
Our regulatory affairs and compliance department is responsible
for assuring compliance with all applicable regulations,
standards and internal policies.

We have initiated numerous quality improvement programs and all
of our manufacturing operations are certified to the new
ISO 13485:2003 global standard.

Our facilities and operations are also subject to various
government environmental and occupational health and safety
requirements of the United States and foreign countries,
including those relating to discharges of substances in the air,
water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of wastes and
the cleanup of properties by pollutants. We believe we are
currently in material compliance with such requirements.

COMPETITION

The orthopaedics industry is highly competitive. In the global
markets for reconstructive implants, trauma and orthopaedic
surgical products, major competitors include: DePuy
Orthopaedics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson),
Stryker Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Synthes, Inc.,
Smith & Nephew plc and Wright Medical Group, Inc.

In the Americas geographic segment, we and DePuy Orthopaedics,
Inc., Stryker Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Smith &
Nephew, Inc. (a subsidiary of Smith & Nephew plc),
Wright Medical Group, Inc. and Synthes, Inc., account for a
large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant
sales.

In the Asia Pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma
products, we compete primarily with DePuy Orthopaedics,
Inc., Stryker Corporation, Synthes, Inc. and Smith &
Nephew plc, as well as regional companies,



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

including Japan Medical Materials Corporation and Japan Medical
Dynamic Marketing, Inc. Factors, such as the dealer system,
complex regulatory environments and the accompanying inability
to compete on price, make it difficult for smaller companies,
particularly those that are non-regional, to compete effectively
with the market leaders in the Asia Pacific region.

In Europe, the reconstructive implant and trauma product markets
are more fragmented than the Americas or the Asia Pacific
segments. The variety of philosophies held by European surgeons
regarding hip reconstruction, for example, has fostered the
existence of many regional European companies, including Mathys
AG and Plus Orthopedics Holdings AG, which compete with us in
addition to the global competitors. Today most hip implants sold
in Europe are products developed specifically for Europe,
although global products are gaining acceptance. Therefore, we
will continue to develop and produce specially tailored products
to meet specific European needs.

In the spinal implant category, we compete globally primarily
with Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic,
Inc.), DePuy Spine (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson),
Synthes, Inc., Stryker Corporation and EBI, L.P. (a subsidiary
of Biomet, Inc.).

In the dental reconstructive implant category, we compete
primarily with Nobel Biocare Holding AG, Straumann Holding AG,
and Implant Innovations, Inc. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.).

Competition within the industry is primarily based on
technology, innovation, quality, reputation, customer
relationships and service. A key factor in our continuing
success in the future will be our ability to develop new
products and improve existing products and technologies. Where
possible, we will continue to seek patent, trademark and other
intellectual property protection concerning the surgical
techniques, materials, technologies and products we design and
develop.

MANUFACTURING AND RAW MATERIALS

We manufacture substantially all of our products at eight
locations, including Warsaw, Indiana; Winterthur, Switzerland;
Ponce, Puerto Rico; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina;
Carlsbad, California; Cedar Knolls, New Jersey; and Etupes,
France. In 2004 and 2005, as part of the execution of the
Centerpulse integration plan, we transferred some production
operations among facilities in order to optimize manufacturing
capacity. As previously announced as part of the Centerpulse
integration plan, in 2005 we ceased all manufacturing activities
in Austin, Texas and expect to liquidate the property in 2006.
Over the past two years, we have expanded certain of our
facilities.

We believe that our manufacturing facilities set industry
standards in terms of automation and have the flexibility to
accommodate future growth. The manufacturing operations at these
facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for
production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy
focused on continuous operational improvement. In addition, at
certain of our manufacturing facilities, many of the employees
are cross-trained.

We generally operate our manufacturing facilities at a targeted
goal of approximately 90 percent of total capacity. We
continually evaluate the potential to in-source products
currently purchased from outside vendors to

on-site

production.

Improving manufacturing productivity has been a major
contributor to improvement in profitability. Major areas of
improvement have included utilization of computer-assisted
robots to precision polish medical devices, automation of
certain manufacturing processes, in-sourcing of core products,
such as castings and forgings, high-speed machining, and
negotiated reductions in third party supplier costs.

We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the design,
development and manufacturing of our products. We purchase all
of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing
our products from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase
some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality
assurance, sole source availability, cost effectiveness or
constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. We work
closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while
maintaining high quality and reliability. Although a change in
suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us
in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the
performance of our products or incorporate unique technology, we
do not believe that the loss of any existing supply contract
would have a material adverse effect on our financial and
operational performance. To date, we have not experienced any
significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials
necessary to fulfill our production schedules.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are
important to the continued success of our business. We also rely
upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological
innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain
our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights
through a variety of methods, including confidentiality
agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors,
employees, consultants and others who may have access to
proprietary information.

We own or control through licensing arrangements more than 2,770
issued patents and more than 1,540 patent applications
throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology
incorporated in many of our products.

EMPLOYEES

We employ more than 6,700 employees worldwide, including
more than 550 employees dedicated to research and
development. Approximately 4,100 employees are located
within the United States and more than 2,600 employees are
located outside of the United States, primarily throughout
Europe and in Japan. We have over 2,300 employees dedicated
to manufacturing our products worldwide. The

2005 FORM 10-K

Warsaw, Indiana, production facility employs more than
1,000 employees. Fewer than 200 North American employees
are members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining
agreement.

In May 2003, we renewed a collective bargaining agreement with
the United Steelworkers of America covering employees at the
Dover, Ohio, facility. This agreement will continue in effect
until May 15, 2007. The agreement automatically renews
thereafter on a

year-to

-year basis
until either party gives written notice of its intent to
terminate the agreement, 60 days prior to a termination
date.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from
our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial
condition and results of operations are discussed below and
elsewhere in this report. The risks and uncertainties described
below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently
not believed to be significant to our business may also affect
our actual results and could harm our business, financial
condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or
uncertainties described below or any additional risks and
uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be materially and
adversely affected.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY

Our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and
market our products against those of our competitors.

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our present or
future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by
technological advances by one or more of our present or future
competitors or by other therapies, including orthobiological
therapies. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop
and acquire new products and technologies.

In the global markets for reconstructive orthopaedic implants,
trauma products and other orthopaedic products, a limited number
of competitors, including DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (a subsidiary
of Johnson & Johnson), Stryker Corporation, Biomet,
Inc., Wright Medical Group, Inc., Synthes, Inc. and
Smith & Nephew plc, compete with us for the majority of
product sales. In the spinal implant category, we compete
globally primarily with Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Medtronic, Inc.), DePuy Spine (a subsidiary of
Johnson & Johnson), Synthes, Inc., Stryker Corporation
and EBI, L.P. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.). In the dental
reconstructive implant category, we compete primarily with Nobel
Biocare Holding AG, Straumann Holding AG, and Implant
Innovations, Inc. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.). Competition is
primarily on the basis of:

•

technology;

•

innovation;

•

quality;

•

reputation;

•

relationships with customers; and

•

service.

In local markets outside of the United States, other factors
influence competition as well, including:

•

local distribution systems;

•

complex regulatory environments; and

•

differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

Our competitors may:

•

have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

•

respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

•

undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

•

adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

•

be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees
    and strategic partners.

Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to
have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.

If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for
our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our
products may decline and our ability to sell our products
profitably may be harmed.

We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors,
dentists and other health care providers, all of which receive
reimbursement for the health care services provided to their
patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and
international government programs, private insurance plans and
managed care programs. These third-party payors may deny
reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a
procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment
methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for
an unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline to
reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. If our
products are not considered cost-effective by third-party
payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for our products.

In addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to
contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the
level of reimbursement for medical products and services. For
example, managed care programs often prescribe only those
orthopaedic recovery products that match a patient as to age,
need for mobility and other parameters in an effort to provide
more cost-effective care. If third-party payors reduce
reimbursement levels to hospitals and other health care
providers for our products, demand for our products may decline
or we may experience pressure to reduce the prices of our
products, which could have a material adverse effect on sales,
financial condition and results of operation.

In international markets, where the movement toward health care
reform and the development of managed care are generally not as
advanced as in the United States, we have experienced downward
pressure on product pricing and other effects of health care
reform. In Japan, for example, a government-operated insurance
system reimburses customers



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

for our products. Under this system, the Japanese government
periodically reviews and reduces the reimbursement levels for
products. If the Japanese government continues to reduce the
reimbursement level for orthopaedic products, our sales,
financial condition and results of operation may be adversely
affected.

We are subject to cost-containment efforts of healthcare
purchasing organizations, which may have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Many existing and potential customers for our products have
combined to form group purchasing organizations in an effort to
contain costs. Group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing
arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors,
and these negotiated prices are made available to a group
purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other
members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a group
purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members
may be less likely to purchase our products, and if the group
purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance
contract for another manufacturer’s products, we may be
precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing
organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement.
Our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group
purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to
our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our
sales, financial condition and results of operations.

We are involved in an ongoing investigation by the United
States Department of Justice of companies in the orthopaedics
industry, the results of which may have a material adverse
effect on our sales, financial condition and results of
operations.

On March 31, 2005, we received a subpoena from the United
States Department of Justice through the United States
Attorney’s Office in Newark, New Jersey, requesting
documents related to consulting contracts or professional
service agreements we have with orthopaedic surgeons. We
understand that similar inquiries were directed to at least four
other companies in the orthopaedics industry. We are cooperating
fully with federal authorities with regard to this matter. If,
as a result of this investigation, we are found to have violated
one or more applicable laws, our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected. If some of our existing business practices are
challenged as unlawful, we may have to change those practices,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We and our customers are subject to various governmental
regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with
these regulations and develop products compatible with these
regulations.

The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market
are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other
Federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process
of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device,
particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental
authorities, can be costly and time consuming and approvals
might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if
at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals
for future products could result in delayed realization of
product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could
have a material adverse effect on our business or results of
operations.

In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA medical
device or other material regulatory requirements, including, for
example, the Quality System Regulation, recordkeeping
regulations, labeling requirements and adverse event reporting
regulations, that failure could result in, among other things:

•

warning letters;

•

fines or civil penalties;

•

injunctions;

•

repairs, replacements or refunds;

•

recalls or seizures of products;

•

total or partial suspension of production;

•

the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s refusal to
    grant future premarket clearances or approvals;

•

withdrawals or suspensions of current product
    applications; and

•

criminal prosecution.

Any of these actions, in combination or alone, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our
products, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other
things:

•

clinical efficacy;

•

product standards;

•

packaging requirements;

•

labeling requirements;

•

import/export restrictions;

•

tariff regulations;

•

duties; and

•

tax requirements.

Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products
in these countries, such as the European Medical Devices
Directive, are similar to those of the FDA. In addition, in many
countries the national health or social security organizations
require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed
with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility. Failure to
receive or delays in the receipt of, relevant foreign
qualifications also could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

As both the FDA and foreign government regulators have become
increasingly stringent, we may be subject to more rigorous
regulation by governmental authorities in the future. Our
products and operations are also often subject to the rules of
industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards
Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of these
regulations, our business will be harmed.

We are subject to health care fraud and abuse regulations
that could require us to change our



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

business practices and restrict our operations in the
future.

Our industry is subject to various Federal and state laws
pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including
anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Violations
of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions,
including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within
the United States, exclusion from participation in government
healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans
Administration (VA) health programs and Civilian Health and
Medical Program Uniformed Service (CHAMPUS). The scope and
enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and
subject to rapid change. Because of the far-reaching and
uncertain nature of these laws, we are required to monitor our
practices to remain in compliance with these laws. If we were to
violate one or more of these laws, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected. If there is a change in law, regulation or
administrative or judicial interpretations, some of our existing
business practices could be challenged as unlawful and, as a
result, we may have to change those practices, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

We may incur product liability losses, and insurance coverage
may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.

Our business is subject to potential product liability risks
that are inherent in the design, development, manufacture and
marketing of medical devices. Our products are often used in
surgical and intensive care settings. In addition, some of the
medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be
implanted in the human body for long periods of time. In the
ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product
liability lawsuits alleging that component failures,
manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of
product-related risks or product-related information resulted in
an unsafe condition or injury to patients. Product liability
lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls,
regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material
adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability
to attract and retain customers.

As part of our risk management policy, we maintain third-party
product liability insurance coverage. However, product liability
claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our
insurance policies or cause us to record a self-insured loss.
Even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance
policy, these policies may have substantial retentions or
deductibles that provide that we will not receive insurance
proceeds until the losses incurred exceed the amount of those
retentions or deductibles. We will be responsible for paying any
losses that are below those retentions or deductibles. A product
liability claim in excess of applicable insurance could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
results of operations.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS

If we fail to effectively utilize the skills and knowledge of
orthopaedic surgeons, customers may not buy our products and our
revenue and profitability may decline.

We maintain professional relationships with a number of
orthopaedic surgeons who assist in product research and
development and advise us on how to satisfy the full range of
surgeon and patient needs. These professionals speak about our
products at medical seminars, assist in the training of other
professionals in the use of our products and provide us with
feedback on the industry’s acceptance of our new products.
The failure of our products to retain the support of orthopaedic
surgeons, who frequently recommend products or are involved in
product selection decisions, or the failure of our new products
to secure and retain similar support from surgeons, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors
upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may
not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may
decline.

Our marketing success in the United States and abroad depends
largely upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and
service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents have
developed professional relationships with existing and potential
customers because of their detailed knowledge of products and
instruments. Many commonly provide operating room personnel with
implant and instrument product training as well as product
support in the operating room. A loss of a significant number of
these agents could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. If some
of the business practices of our independent sales agents and
distributors are challenged as unlawful, they may have to change
those practices, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our
products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy
our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we
may not anticipate because of:

Without the timely introduction of new products and
enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If
that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer.
The success of our new product offerings will depend on several
factors, including our ability to:

•

properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

•

commercialize new products in a timely manner;



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical
techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some
or all markets, because of, among other factors:

•

entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

•

the need for regulatory clearance; and

•

uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment
in research and development before we can determine their
commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources
necessary to fund the production. In addition, even if we are
able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of
our products, these enhancements or new generations of products
may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development
and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer
preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products
embodying new technologies or features.

We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside
of the United States, which subjects us to additional business
risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to
increased costs.

Because we sell our products in more than 100 countries, our
business is subject to risks associated with doing business
internationally. In 2005, we derived approximately
$1,344 million, or 41% of our total revenue, from sales of
our products outside of the United States. We intend to continue
to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, which
could expose us to additional risks associated with
international sales and operations. Our international operations
are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and
potential costs, including:

Any of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate
fluctuations, which can increase our costs and may cause our
profitability to decline.

A substantial portion of our foreign generated revenues are
generated in Europe and Japan. The United States dollar value of
our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange
rate fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the
United States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese Yen,
as well as other currencies, could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations. We address currency risk
management through regular operating and financing activities,
and on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial
instruments. The derivative financial instruments we enter into
are in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major
financial institutions. The forward contracts are designed to
hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily
intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods
consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and
losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are
temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then
recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings.

We may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology
and other intellectual property, which would allow competitors
or others to take advantage of our research and development
efforts.

Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market
technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or
maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not
be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary
technologies. Also, our currently pending or future patent
applications may not result in issued patents. In the United
States, patent applications are confidential for 18 months
following their filing, and because third parties may have filed
patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent
applications without our being aware of those applications, our
patent applications may not have priority over patent
applications of others. In addition, our issued patents may not
contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third
parties with similar technologies or products, or provide us
with any competitive advantage. If a third party initiates
litigation regarding our patents, our collaborators’
patents, or those patents for which we have license rights, and
is successful, a court could declare our patents invalid or
unenforceable or limit the scope of coverage of those patents.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and
the courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims
allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and
biotechnology patents. If the USPTO or the courts begin to allow
or interpret claims more



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

broadly, the incidence and cost of patent interference
proceedings and the risk of infringement litigation will likely
increase. On the other hand, if the USPTO or the courts begin to
allow or interpret claims more narrowly, the value of our
proprietary rights may be reduced. Any changes in, or unexpected
interpretations of, the patent laws may adversely affect our
ability to enforce our patent position.

In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or
limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier
for competitors to capture market position. Competitors may also
capture market share from us by designing products that mirror
the capabilities of our products or technology without
infringing our intellectual property rights. If we do not obtain
sufficient international protection for our intellectual
property, our competitiveness in international markets could be
impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue.

We also rely upon trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and
continuing technological innovation to remain competitive. We
attempt to protect this information with security measures,
including the use of confidentiality agreements with our
employees, consultants, and corporate collaborators. These
individuals may breach these agreements and any remedies
available to us may be insufficient to compensate our damages.
Furthermore, our trade secrets, know-how and other technology
may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our
competitors.

We may be subject to intellectual property litigation and
infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant
expenses or prevent us from selling our products.

A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property
infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and
profitability, in some cases materially. From time to time, we
receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and
receive claims of potential infringement. We may be unaware of
intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of
our technology. If someone claims that our products infringed
their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation
could be costly and time consuming and would divert the
attention of management and key personnel from other business
issues. The complexity of the technology involved and the
uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these
risks. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might
require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements.
However, we may be unable to obtain royalty or license
agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. We also may be
subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing us
from manufacturing, selling or using some of our products in the
event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual
property infringement. Any of these adverse consequences could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We may complete additional acquisitions, which could increase
our costs or liabilities or be disruptive.

We intend to continue to look for additional strategic
acquisitions. We may not be able to complete additional
acquisitions or to integrate successfully any acquired
businesses without substantial expense, delay or other
operational or financial problems. Acquiring and integrating new
businesses involves risk, including the following:

•

we may need to divert more management resources to integration
    than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to
    pursue other more profitable activities;

•

the difficulties of integration may be increased if we need to
    integrate geographically separated organizations, personnel with
    disparate business backgrounds and companies with different
    corporate cultures;

•

we may not eliminate as many redundant costs as we anticipated
    in selecting our acquisition candidates; and

•

one or more of our acquisition candidates also may have
    liabilities or adverse operating issues that we failed to
    discover through our diligence prior to the acquisition.

If we are unable to form strategic alliances, or if our
strategic alliances fail to achieve their objectives, our
operating results will be negatively impacted.

Several of our strategic initiatives involve alliances with
other orthopaedic and biotechnology companies. These include our
agreement with Revivicor, Inc. relating to orthopaedic tissue
technology, our collaboration with ISTO Technologies, Inc.
relating to regenerative cartilage technology and our
distribution agreement with Heraeus relating to orthopaedic bone
cement products. The success of these and similar arrangements
is largely dependent on technology and other intellectual
property contributed by our strategic partners or the resources,
efforts, and skills of these partners. Disputes and difficulties
in such relationships are common, often due to conflicting
priorities or conflicts of interest. Merger and acquisition
activity may exacerbate these conflicts. The benefits of these
alliances are reduced or eliminated when strategic partners:

Furthermore, under some of our strategic alliances, we may make
milestone payments well in advance of commercialization of
products with no assurance that we will ever recoup these
payments. We also may make equity investments in our strategic
partners. These investments may decline in value and result in
our incurring financial statement charges in the future.

We depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw
materials and outsourced activities.

We use a number of suppliers for raw materials we need to
manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing
activities. These suppliers must provide the materials and
perform the activities to our standards for us to



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

meet our quality and regulatory requirements. Some key raw
materials and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a
single source or a limited number of sources. A prolonged
disruption or other inability to obtain these materials or
activities could materially and adversely affect our ability to
satisfy demand for our products, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Our future profitability may be affected by changes to our
product category and region sales mix.

Reconstructive implants produce the highest operating profit
margins among our product categories. These products accounted
for approximately 83 percent of 2005 net sales. Sales
in our Americas region accounted for approximately
59 percent of 2005 net sales. Sales in the Americas
region produce the highest operating profit margins in the
geographic markets in which we operate. While we expect net
sales of reconstructive implants and net sales in the Americas
region to remain strong, changes to our product category mix or
our region sales mix could adversely affect our future
profitability.

Properties

We have the following properties:

We ceased production at our Austin, Texas facility in October
2005 and expect to liquidate the property in 2006. We are in the
process of expanding the research and development facilities at
our Warsaw location. The expansion should be completed in 2006
and add approximately 100,000 square feet to our existing
research and development facilities.

We believe the current facilities, including manufacturing,
warehousing, research and development and office space, together
with the planned expansions provide sufficient capacity to meet
ongoing demands. Once a facility reaches 85 percent
utilization, we examine alternatives for either expanding that
facility or acquiring new facilities to meet our ongoing demands.

In addition to the above, we maintain more than 100 other
offices and warehouse facilities in more than 24 countries
around the world, including the United States, Japan, Australia,
France, Russia, India, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and China. We
believe that all of the facilities and equipment are in good
condition, well maintained and able to operate at present levels.

    2001 reflect the retroactive application of a new accounting
    method for instruments. Effective January 1, 2003, we
    changed the method of accounting for instruments which we own
    and are used by orthopaedic surgeons during total joint
    replacement and other surgical procedures. Instruments are
    recognized as long-lived assets and are included in property,
    plant and equipment and are depreciated using the straight-line
    method based on estimated useful lives, determined principally
    in reference to associated product life cycles, primarily five
    years. In prior periods, undeployed instruments were carried as
    a prepaid cost and recognized in selling, general and
    administrative expense in the year in which the instruments were
    placed into service.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
corresponding notes included elsewhere in this
Form

10-K.

This
discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements.

OVERVIEW

We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture
and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants, including
joint and dental, spinal implants, trauma products and related
orthopaedic surgical products (sometimes referred to in this
report as “OSP”). Reconstructive orthopaedic implants
restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints
such as knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive
implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have
lost teeth due to trauma or disease. Spinal implants are
utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the
treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in
all regions of the spine. Trauma products are devices used
primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to
support the body’s natural healing process. OSP include
supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical
procedures and post-operation rehabilitation. We have operations
in more than 24 countries and market products in more than 100
countries. We manage operations through three reportable
geographic segments – the Americas, Europe and Asia
Pacific.

We believe the following developments or trends are important in
understanding our financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Demand (Volume and Mix) Trends

Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales
contributed 9 percentage points of sales growth, which is
the same as 2004 sales growth when compared to 2003 on a pro
forma


basis. We believe the market for orthopaedic procedure volume on
a global basis continues to rise at mid to high single digit
rates driven by an aging global population, obesity, proven
clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in
surgical techniques (such as our

MIS

Procedures and
Technologies) and more active lifestyles, among other factors.
In addition, the continued shift in demand to premium products,
such as

Longevity, Durasul

and

Prolong

Highly
Crosslinked Polyethylenes,

Trabecular Metal

Technology
products, high-flex knees, knee revision products and porous hip
stems, continue to positively affect sales growth. For example,
during the year ended December 31, 2005, sales of products
incorporating

Trabecular Metal

Technology were over
$100 million, an increase of nearly 40 percent over
2004.

We believe innovative surgical approaches will continue to
significantly affect the orthopaedics industry. We have made
significant progress in the development and introduction of

MIS

Implants, Procedures and Technologies. During the
year ended December 31, 2005, The Zimmer Institute and its
satellite locations trained nearly 2,500 surgeons on advanced
techniques, including over 2,200 surgeons on

MIS

Procedures, which is approximately 70 percent greater
than the number of surgeons trained last year.

Pricing Trends

Selling price increases contributed 1 percentage point of
sales growth during the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to 2 percentage points in 2004 when compared to
2003 on a pro forma basis. The reduced benefit from selling
price increases in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily attributed
to the Americas operating segment. The Americas experienced a
1 percent increase in selling prices during the year ended
December 31, 2005, compared to a 4 percent increase in
2004 on a pro forma basis. We believe the slower growth in
selling price increases was primarily due to hospital cost
containment efforts. In Europe, selling prices for the year
ended December 31, 2005 decreased 1 percent, compared
to a negligible effect in 2004 on a pro forma basis. Within
Europe, Germany, which constitutes approximately 6 percent
of our sales, experienced a 5 percent decrease in selling
prices in the year ended December 31, 2005, as a result of
reductions in government implant reimbursement rates. The
decline in Germany was partially offset by increased selling
prices in other European markets. Asia Pacific selling prices
had a negligible effect on sales for the year ended
December 31, 2005, compared to a 2 percent decrease in
2004 on a pro forma basis. Effective April 1, 2004, the
Japanese government reduced reimbursement rates, which
contributed to a reduction of our selling prices in Japan by
approximately 4 percent during the year ended
December 31, 2004, on a pro forma basis. The negative
effect of this decrease in Japan occurred only in the first
quarter of 2005, as the anniversary of the price reductions was
April 1, 2005. Japan represents approximately
9 percent of our sales. The next Japanese reimbursement
change is expected to be April 1, 2006, and therefore, we
expect Japanese selling prices to remain the same through the
first quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in the prior
year. We expect the Japanese government to reduce reimbursement
rates again at that time. We estimate this reduction will affect
Japan sales negatively by approximately 5 percent for the
year ending December 31, 2006, based upon Zimmer
Japan’s portfolio of reconstructive and trauma products.
With pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment
efforts and group purchasing organizations, we estimate


The unaudited pro forma net sales information for 2003,
    including comparisons to 2004 net sales, contained in this
    Form

10-K

and
    presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles has been derived from the audited
    financial statements of Zimmer Holdings for the year ended
    December 31, 2003 and the financial statements of
    Centerpulse for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 to
    give effect to the Centerpulse acquisition as if it had occurred
    on January 1, 2003.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

global sales could decline by approximately 1 percent in
2006 due to selling price decreases.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

For the year ended December 31, 2005, foreign currency
exchange rates had a negligible effect on global sales growth.
However, a stronger U.S. Dollar compared to most foreign
currencies in the three month period ended December 31,
2005, compared to the same 2004 period, decreased sales by
3 percentage points. If foreign currency exchange rates
remain consistent with the year end rates, we estimate that
weaker foreign currency exchange rates will have a negative
effect of approximately 1 percent on sales for the year
ended December 31, 2006. We address currency risk through
regular operating and financing activities, and under
appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization,
through the use of forward contracts solely for managing foreign
currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign currency
exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting
gains/losses on hedge contracts, which are recorded in cost of
products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is
expected to be minimal.

New Product Sales

New products, which management defines as products or stock
keeping units (“SKU’s”) introduced within the
prior

36-month

period
to a particular market, accounted for 21 percent, or
$695 million, of our sales during the year ended
December 31, 2005. Adoption rates for new technologies are
a key indicator of industry performance. Our sales have grown
with the introduction of new products, such as

Trabecular
Metal

Modular Acetabular Cups, certain SKU’s of the

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution for the LPS,

LPS-Flex,

and

CR-Flex

Knees, and the

Dynesys

Dynamic Stabilization System.

We believe new products in our current pipeline should continue
to favorably affect our operating performance. Products we
expect to contribute to new product sales in 2006 include
products incorporating Trabecular Metal Technology, including a
hip stem and humeral shoulder, the

VerSys
Epoch

®

Composite Full Coat Hip Prosthesis, the

NexGen MIS

Tibial
Plate, various trauma products including new

Zimmer

Periarticular Locking Plates and the

Sirus

Intramedullary Nail System released to the U.S. market,
and alternative bearing surfaces including

ceramic-on

-ceramic and

metal-on

-metal.

Acquisition of Centerpulse

We are near completion of our integration plan for Centerpulse.
In the fourth quarter of 2005, we ceased manufacturing
operations at our Austin, Texas facility. Remaining integration
milestones relate to IT systems conversions, primarily in Europe
and Asia Pacific, the residual costs of decommissioning the
Austin facility and disposing of this asset, continued
in-sourcing and a few miscellaneous items. We expect to complete
the integration plan for Centerpulse by the end of 2006.

Net synergies associated with the acquisition and integration of
Centerpulse were approximately $63 million in 2005. We
define net synergies as expense synergies less operating profit
reductions resulting from integration related sales losses and
increases in operating expenses directly resulting from the
acquisition. With the majority of our manufacturing integration
plan completed, additional expense synergies should be realized
in 2006 and 2007 as the inventory produced after the completion
of the integration plan is sold. Operating expense synergies,
principally in selling, general and administrative expenses,
have exceeded our original expectations, reflecting more rapid
than expected execution and achievement of operational
efficiencies. We estimate our integration related sales losses
and increased operating expenses were approximately
$28 million in 2005. Expense synergies for 2006 are
expected to be in excess of $100 million. We expect these
synergies will be slightly offset by sales losses and increased
operating expenses.

We incurred $56.6 million of acquisition and integration
expenses during the year ended December 31, 2005, and
expect to incur $12 – $15 million of acquisition
and integration expenses in 2006.

Acquisition of Implex

We completed the acquisition of Implex on April 23, 2004.
We had a strategic alliance with Implex since 2000 for the
development and distribution of reconstructive implant and
trauma products incorporating

Trabecular Metal

Technology. Pursuant to the strategic alliance, we sold products
incorporating

Trabecular Metal

Technology, which
represented over 90 percent of Implex sales.

New Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment”. We adopted this accounting standard using the
prospective method and will not restate prior periods. We
estimate the adoption of this accounting standard will reduce
diluted earnings per share by $0.23 – $0.25 during the
year ended December 31, 2006. However, this is a non-cash
expense and will not have an effect on our net cash flows.

in the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased to

define “inventory

step-up”

as the
difference between the cost basis and the fair value of acquired
Centerpulse and Implex inventories. Other primary contributors
to the improvement in gross profit margin were reduced inventory
charges due to improved inventory management, increased selling
prices, favorable resolution of certain legal and other matters
and reduced royalties. Royalty expenses as a percentage of sales
declined due to a favorable mix of non-royalty bearing sales.

Operating Expenses

R&D as a percentage of net sales was 5.3 percent for
the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to
5.6 percent in 2004. R&D increased to
$175.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
from $166.7 million in 2004, reflecting increased spending
on projects focused on areas of strategic significance,
including orthobiologics. In 2005, we doubled the number of
internal people and project-related orthobiological investments.
Currently, our product pipeline consists of more than 160 active
projects. We are also investing in

MIS

Procedures and
Technologies, material technologies, including woven materials
and drug/device combinations and intelligence technologies,
including sensor technology. We delivered more than 79 projects
to the market in 2005. We target R&D spending to the high
end of what management believes to be an average of
4-6 percent for the industry.

SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 38.3 percent for
the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to
39.9 percent in 2004. The decrease was primarily due to
sales growth and realized expense synergies. In addition, lower
product liability claims and well controlled general and
administrative spending reduced SG&A as a percentage of
sales.

Acquisition, integration and other expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2005 were $56.6 million compared to
$81.1 million in 2004, and included $13.3 million of
employee severance and retention expenses, $12.7 million of
sales agent contract termination expenses, $6.9 million of
costs related to integrating our information technology systems,
$6.2 million of facility relocation expenses,
$5.6 million of integration consulting expenses,
$3.2 million related to the impairment loss on the Austin
facility, $3.1 million of personnel expenses and travel for
full-time integration team members and $5.6 million of
other expenses.

Operating Profit, Income Taxes
    and Net Earnings

Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2005
increased 38 percent to $1,055.0 million, from
$763.2 million in 2004. Increased sales, improved gross
profit margins, realized operating expense synergies, controlled
operating expenses and decreased acquisition and integration
expenses drove operating profit.

The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes, minority
interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
increased to 29.5 percent for the year ended
December 31, 2005, from 25.9 percent in 2004. The
provision for income taxes in 2004 included a $34.5 million
benefit (4.7 percent) as a result of revaluing deferred
taxes of acquired Centerpulse operations due to a reduction in
the ongoing Swiss tax rate. Exclusive of this one time benefit
in the provision for income taxes, we were able to realize a
lower effective tax rate. The reasons for the lower effective
tax rate were the implementation of several European
restructuring initiatives, the successful negotiation of a lower
ongoing Swiss tax rate (from approximately 24 percent to
12.5 percent) and the continued expansion of operations in
lower tax jurisdictions, including Puerto Rico. In 2004, the
successful negotiation of the lower Swiss tax rate was effective
for the last five months of the year, whereas in 2005 the
benefit was recognized for the entire year.

Net earnings increased 35 percent to $732.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to
$541.8 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to
higher operating profit and decreased interest expense due to a
lower average outstanding debt balance, offset by a higher
effective tax rate. Basic and diluted earnings per share
increased 33 and 34 percent to $2.96 and $2.93,
respectively, from $2.22 and $2.19 in 2004.

Gross Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 73.8 percent

68.1 percent for the three month period ended
December 31, 2003 (the first quarter of combined operations
reflecting Centerpulse). The following table reconciles the
gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for

2.0 percent of net sales) compared to the three month
period ended December 31, 2003 ($42.7 million, or
6.1 percent of net sales) and increases in selling prices
were the primary contributors to improved gross margins. In
addition, operating segment mix and product category mix both
had a positive effect on gross margins due to higher sales
growth in the more profitable Americas segment compared to
Europe and Asia Pacific, higher sales growth of reconstructive
implants and the continued shift to premium products. Offsetting
these favorable effects were a variety of other items, including
increased royalty expenses and higher losses on foreign exchange
contracts included in cost of products sold, partially offset by
reduced manufacturing costs due to automation, vertical
integration and process improvements.

Operating Expenses

R&D as a percentage of net sales was 5.6 percent for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. R&D
increased to $166.7 million from $105.8 million,
reflecting a full year of Centerpulse research and development
expenses and increased spending on active projects focused on
areas of strategic significance. During 2004, we delivered more
than 40 major development projects to market.

SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 39.9 percent for
the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to
38.8 percent for the same 2003 period. Amortization expense
increased to $39.1 million, or 1.3 percent of sales,
during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to
$10.9 million, or less than 1 percent of sales, during
the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was
primarily due to amortization expense related to Centerpulse and
Implex finite lived intangible assets. In addition, during 2004
we continued to introduce or expand strategic programs and
activities. In 2004, The Zimmer Institute and its satellite
locations were well utilized with over 1,400 surgeons
trained, compared to 500 surgeons trained in 2003. These
surgeon training costs are recognized in SG&A. We also
recognized approximately $5 million of

Sarbanes-Oxley

compliance expenses, including consultant fees and increased
audit fees. These increases were partially offset by expense
synergies realized from the Centerpulse acquisition and
controlled spending.

Acquisition and integration expenses related to the acquisitions
of Centerpulse and Implex were $81.1 million compared to
$79.6 million for the same 2003 period and included
$24.4 million of sales agent and lease contract termination
expenses, $24.2 million of integration consulting expenses,
$9.4 million of employee severance and retention expenses,
$7.8 million of professional fees, $5.2 million of
personnel expenses and travel for full-time integration team
members, $4.3 million of costs related to integrating our
information technology systems, $2.9 million of costs
related to relocation of facilities, and $2.9 million of
other miscellaneous acquisition and integration expenses.

Operating Profit, Income Taxes
    and Net Earnings

Operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2004
increased 69 percent to $763.2 million from
$450.7 million in the comparable 2003 period. Operating
profit growth was driven by Zimmer standalone sales growth,
operating profit



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

contributed by Centerpulse, effectively controlled operating
expenses and the absence of in-process research and development
expense in 2004 compared to $11.2 million in 2003. These
favorable items were partially offset by Centerpulse and Implex
inventory

step-up

of
$59.4 million in 2004 compared to $42.7 million in
2003 and intangible asset amortization of $39.1 million in
2004 versus $10.9 million in 2003.

The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes, minority
interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
decreased to 25.9 percent for the year ended
December 31, 2004 from 33.6 percent for the same
period in 2003. A major component of the decrease
(4.7 percent, or $34.5 million) was the result of
revaluing deferred taxes of acquired Centerpulse operations due
to a reduction in the ongoing Swiss tax rate. The major reasons
for the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate were the
ongoing European restructuring initiatives, the successful
negotiation of a lower ongoing Swiss tax rate (from
approximately 24 percent to 12.5 percent) and
continued expansion of operations in lower tax jurisdictions.

Net earnings increased 57 percent to $541.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to
$346.3 million in the same 2003 period. The increase was
due to higher operating profit offset partially by increased
interest expense, $31.7 million in 2004 compared to
$13.2 million in 2003. Net earnings for 2003 also included
a one-time, $55.1 million (net of tax), non-cash cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle for instruments. Net
earnings in 2004 also benefited from the decreased effective
income tax rate. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased
33 percent and 34 percent to $2.22 and $2.19,
respectively, from $1.67 and $1.64 in 2003.

Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

In the Americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales
increased due to product category mix and the effective control
of operating expenses, including realized expense synergies and
controlled general and administrative spending.

European operating profit as a percentage of net sales improved
due to the realization of expense synergies related to the
elimination of redundant functions and controlled selling,
general and administrative spending.

Asia Pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales
increased primarily due to product category mix, lower royalty
expenses as a percentage of sales and improved inventory
management.

Year Ended December 31, 2004

Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

In the Americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales
improved slightly due to improved selling prices, lower royalty
expenses as a percentage of net sales, product category mix and
controlled operating expenses. Increased selling expenses as a
percentage of net sales due to the restructuring of certain
distributor contracts partially offset these improvements.

In Europe, operating profit as a percentage of net sales
improved due to improved selling prices, product category mix,
country sales mix, controlled operating expenses and the
favorable effect of the Centerpulse acquisition. Country sales
mix made favorable contributions as the more profitable German
market represented a greater percentage of total Europe sales.

Asia Pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales
declined primarily due to decreased selling prices, principally
the result of the decrease in government reimbursement rates in
Japan, and increased selling expenses as a percentage of net
sales due to the restructuring of certain dealer contracts in
Japan.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows provided by operating activities were
$878.2 million in 2005 compared to $862.2 million in
2004. The principal source of cash was net earnings of
$732.5 million. We experienced $119.3 million of
positive cash flow related to income taxes during the year ended
December 31, 2005 primarily due to the utilization of
acquired Centerpulse tax attributes, the utilization of foreign
tax credits, the realization of certain state/local tax
incentives and exercises of employee stock options. Operating
cash flows from working capital decreased compared to the 2004
period as a result of sales growth, payment of acquisition and
integration related expenses and resolution of certain legal and
product liability matters.

Working capital management continues to be a key focus. At
December 31, 2005, we had 56 days of sales outstanding
in accounts receivable, favorable to December 31, 2004 by
3 days. The improvement was achieved through improvement in
all reporting segments. At December 31, 2005, we had



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

283 days of inventory on hand, unfavorable to
December 31, 2004 by 28 days. Our inventory levels
have increased due to new products, higher purchases of raw
materials in advance of expected increases of raw material
prices and inventory build up to accommodate the Austin facility
shut-down.

Cash flows used in investing activities were $311.1 million
in the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to
$388.3 million in 2004. In 2005, we paid $44.1 million
pursuant to the terms of the Implex acquisition agreement for
contingent

earn-out

payments. Additions to instruments during the year ended
December 31, 2005 were $150.0 million compared to
$139.6 million in 2004. Increases in instrument purchases
were primarily to support new product launches and sales growth.
In 2006, we expect purchases of instruments to approximate
$110 – $115 million as we continue to invest in
instruments to support new products, sales growth and

MIS

Procedures. The anticipated decrease in instrument purchases
compared to 2005 is the result of high rates of penetration
already achieved with

MIS

instruments across our broad
base of customers. Additionally, we have been able to
successfully in-source instruments at a lower cost. Additions to
other property, plant and equipment during the year ended
December 31, 2005 were $105.3 million compared to
$100.8 million in 2004. Increases were related to facility
expansions in Warsaw, Indiana; Ponce, Puerto Rico; and
Parsippany, New Jersey. Facility expansions were due to
increased demand, the transfer of production to our other
manufacturing sites as a result of the closure of the Austin,
Texas facility and the tripling of

Trabecular Metal

Technology production capacity. During 2006, we expect
purchases of other property, plant and equipment to approximate
$140 – $150 million, as a result of ongoing
facility expansions in Warsaw, Indiana, new information
technology systems and further productivity related investments.

Cash flows used in financing activities were $484.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to
$402.0 million in 2004. We repaid $555.3 million of
debt, net, in the year ended December 31, 2005, utilizing
cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities and
$76.7 million in cash proceeds received from employee stock
compensation plans. Additionally, in December our Board of
Directors approved a stock repurchase program which resulted in
the repurchase of $4.1 million of common stock in 2005.

We have a five year $1,350 million revolving,

multi-currency,

senior
unsecured credit facility maturing March 31, 2010 (the
“Senior Credit Facility”). We had $81.6 million
outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility at
December 31, 2005, and therefore, our available borrowings
were $1,268.4 million. The $81.6 million is in Japan
and carries a low interest rate, which is why we have not repaid
the debt. The Senior Credit Facility contains a provision
whereby borrowings may be increased to $1,750 million.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign and domestic
subsidiaries are the borrowers and our wholly owned domestic
subsidiaries are the guarantors of the Senior Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are used for general
corporate purposes and bear interest at a

LIBOR-based

rate plus
an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior
unsecured long-term credit rating and the amounts drawn under
the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a
fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. The
Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and
negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured
financing arrangement, including, among other things,
limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0
to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5
to 1.0. If we fall below an investment grade credit rating,
additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on
investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were
in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit
Facility as of December 31, 2005. Commitments under the
Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a
facility and a utilization fee. The Senior Credit Facility is
rated BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
and is not rated by Moody’s Investors’ Service, Inc.

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
$65 million.

The terms of the Implex acquisition include additional cash
earn-out payments that are contingent on the year-over-year
growth of Implex product sales through 2006. We have paid
$96.0 million of earn-out payments through
December 31, 2005. We estimate remaining payments, which
will occur in 2006, to be in a range from $30 million to
$40 million.

In December, our Board of Directors authorized a stock
repurchase program of up to $1 billion through
December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2005,
$4.1 million of common stock had been repurchased. We may
use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock under this
program.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, together
with available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, will
be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure
and debt service needs. Should investment opportunities arise,
we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will
allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

We have entered into contracts with various third parties in the
normal course of business which will require future payments.
The following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in
millions):

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our financial results are affected by the selection and
application of accounting policies and methods. Significant
accounting policies which require management’s judgment are
discussed below.

Excess Inventory and Instruments

– We must
determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our
inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at
our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if
instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain
undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are
established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to
net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of
reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to
historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our
products and instrument systems and components. The basis for
the determination is generally the same for all inventory and
instrument items and categories except for

work-in

-progress
inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued
items are generally destroyed and completely written off.
Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves
based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other
factors on a regular basis.

Income Taxes

– We estimate income tax expense
and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction.
Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction
is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income
sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax
assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if
it is determined to be “more likely than not” that the
deferred tax benefit will not be realized. Federal income taxes
are provided on the portion of the income of foreign
subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. We
operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions. We are subject to
regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those
jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended
periods of time to resolve. We make use of all available
information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters
requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense,
liabilities and reserves. We believe adequate provisions exist
for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to
review or audit.

Commitments and Contingencies

– Accruals for
product liability and other claims are established with internal
and external legal counsel based on current information and
historical settlement information for claims, related fees and
for claims incurred but not reported. We use an actuarial model
to assist management in determining an appropriate level of
accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of
claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to
arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in
the actuarial model. The amounts established represent
management’s best estimate of the ultimate costs that it
will incur under the various contingencies.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

– We evaluate
the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible
assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the
carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events
or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate
the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably
estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. Changes
to these assumptions could require us to record impairment
charges on these assets.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Information about recent accounting pronouncements is included
in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which
are included in this report under Item 8.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing
business operations, including risks from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices
that could affect our financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market
risks through regular operating and financing activities, and
through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use
derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools
and not for speculative investment purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency
exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets
denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British
Pounds, Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars. We manage the
foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which
allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural
offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate
movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, we
enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of
foreign exchange forward contracts with major financial
institutions. These forward contracts are designed to hedge
anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily
intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods
consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and
losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are
temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then
recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects
net earnings.

For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005, we had
obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros,
Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars and Australian
Dollars or purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at
set maturity dates ranging from January 2006 through May 2008.
The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered
into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, were $1,142 million and
$861 million, respectively. The notional amounts of
outstanding forward contracts entered into with third parties to
purchase Swiss Francs at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were
$195 million and $191 million, respectively. The
weighted average contract rates outstanding are Euro:
USD 1.26, USD: Swiss Franc 1.20, USD: Japanese
Yen 102, British Pound: USD 1.79, USD: Canadian
Dollar 1.22 and Australian Dollar: USD 0.73.

We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk
management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms
of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted
transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges,
changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are
generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the
fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management
program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess
potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and
financial position relating to hypothetical movements in
currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in
the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding
at December 31, 2005, indicated that, if the
U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent
relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound,
Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar, with no change in the
interest differentials, the fair value of those contracts would
increase or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods
through 2009, depending on the direction of the change, by an
average approximate amount of $67.4 million,
$21.2 million, $20.0 million, $11.2 million,
$6.9 million and $5.9 million for the Euro, Swiss
Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar and
Australian Dollar contracts, respectively. Any change in the
fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of
a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be
largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged
transaction. Consequently, foreign exchange contracts would not
subject us to material risk due to exchange rate movements
because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and
losses on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged.

We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities of approximately
$1,775 million at December 31, 2005, primarily in
Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and Euros. Approximately
$1,003 million of the net asset exposure at
December 31, 2005 relates to goodwill recorded in the
Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and
liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
entity’s functional currency. As a result, foreign currency
translation gains/losses recognized in earnings under
SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”
are generally offset with gain/losses on the foreign currency
forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome,
titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into
12 to 24 month supply contracts, where available, on these
commodities to alleviate the effect of market fluctuation in
prices. As part of our risk management program, we perform
sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price
changes. A 10 percent price change across all these
commodities would not have a material effect on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

INTEREST RATE RISK

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk
from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of
operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to
interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing
activities.

Presently, we invest our cash and equivalents in money market
and investment-grade short-term debt instruments. The primary
investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of our
invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk.
Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our
investment portfolio.

Our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the
variable rates associated with our credit facilities. We are
subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest
rates on the committed Senior Credit Facility and our
uncommitted credit facilities. Presently, all of our debt
outstanding bears interest at short-term rates. We currently do
not hedge our interest rate exposure, but may do so in the
future. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of
December 31, 2005, a change of 10 percent in interest
rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would
not have a material effect on interest expense. However, due to
the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their
possible effects, this analysis assumes no such action, nor
management actions to mitigate interest rate changes. Further,
this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the
level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment.

CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash, cash
equivalents, counterparty transactions, and accounts receivable.

We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions
and money market instruments, and limit the amount of credit
exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any
significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and
investments.

We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with
which we conduct business fail to perform. However, this loss is
limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the
counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our
obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing
with a diversified group of major financial institutions. Credit
risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial
condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines. We do
not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and
their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by
frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to
whom credit is granted in the normal course of business.
However, essentially all of our trade receivables are
concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare
industry in the U.S. and internationally or with distributors or
dealers who operate in international markets and, accordingly,
are exposed to their respective business, economic and country
specific variables. Repayment is dependent upon the financial
stability of these industry sectors and the respective
countries’ national economic and health care systems.
Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals,
credit limits and monitoring procedures and we believe that
reserves for losses are adequate. There is no significant net
exposure due to any individual customer or other major
concentration of credit risk.

13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers and effected by the
Company’s Board of Directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes
those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, the
Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of
December 31, 2005, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
has audited management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005, as stated in their report which
appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Zimmer Holdings,
Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of Zimmer Holdings,
Inc.’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and
of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Zimmer
Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005
and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under Item 15(a) (2), presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 4, the Company changed its method of
accounting for instruments effective January 1, 2003.

Internal control over financial
    reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing at the conclusion of Item 7A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by
the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

BUSINESS

We design, develop, manufacture and market reconstructive
orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal
implants, trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical
products. Joint reconstructive implants restore function lost
due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips,
shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants restore
function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to
trauma or disease. Spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic
surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative
diseases, deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine.
Trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach or
stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s
natural healing process. Our related orthopaedic surgical
products include surgical supplies and instruments designed to
aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation
rehabilitation.

We have operations in more than 24 countries and market our
products in more than 100 countries. We operate in a single
industry but have three reportable geographic segments, the
Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.

The words “we”, “us”, “our” and
similar words refer to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its
subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

– The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Zimmer Holdings and
its subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling equity
position. Investments in companies in which we exercise
significant influence over the operating and financial affairs,
but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method.
Under the equity method, we record the investment at cost and
adjust the carrying amount of the investment by our
proportionate share of the investee’s net earnings or
losses. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
are eliminated. Certain amounts in the 2004 and 2003
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the 2005 presentation.

Use of Estimates

– The consolidated financial
statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that
are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

– The financial
statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and
liabilities and average exchange rates for operating results.
Unrealized translation gains and losses are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’
equity. When a transaction is denominated in a currency other
than the subsidiary’s functional currency, we recognize a
transaction gain or loss when the transaction is settled.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in net
earnings for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 were not significant.

Revenue Recognition

– We sell product through
three principal channels: 1) direct to health care
institutions, referred to as direct channel accounts,
2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and
3) directly to dental practices and dental laboratories.
The direct channel accounts represent more than 80 percent
of our net sales. Through this channel, inventory is generally
consigned to sales agents or customers so that products are
available when needed for surgical procedures. No revenue is
recognized upon the placement of inventory into consignment as
we retain title and maintain the inventory on our balance sheet.
Upon implantation, we issue an invoice and revenue is
recognized. Pricing for products is generally predetermined by
contracts with customers, agents acting on behalf of customer
groups or by government regulatory bodies, depending on the
market. Price discounts under group purchasing contracts are
generally linked to volume of implant purchases by customer
health care institutions within a specified group. At negotiated
thresholds within a contract buying period, price discounts may
increase. Revenue is recognized on sales to stocking
distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices and dental
laboratories, which account for less than 20 percent of our net
sales, when title to product passes to them, generally upon
shipment. Product is generally sold to distributors on secured
credit terms at fixed prices for specified periods. A
distributor may return product in the event that we terminate
the relationship. Under those circumstances, we record an
estimated sales return in the period in which constructive
notice of termination is given to a distributor.

The reserves for doubtful accounts were $23.3 million and
$28.4 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Shipping and Handling

– Amounts billed to
customers for shipping and handling of products are reflected in
net sales, and are not significant. Expenses incurred related to
shipping and handling of products are reflected in selling,
general and administrative and were $91.6 million,
$86.3 million and $50.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Acquisition, Integration and Other

– We
recognize incremental expenses resulting directly from the
acquisitions of Centerpulse and Implex as “Acquisition,
integration and other” expenses. Acquisition, integration
and other expenses



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
included (in millions):

Cash and Equivalents

– We consider all highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in
the balance sheet for cash and equivalents are valued at cost,
which approximates their fair value. Restricted cash is
primarily composed of cash held in escrow related to certain
insurance coverage.

Inventories

– Inventories, net of allowances
for obsolete and slow-moving goods, are stated at the lower of
cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in first-out
basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

– Property, plant
and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and
improvements, three to eight years for machinery and equipment
and generally five years for instruments. Maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred. In accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” we review property, plant and equipment
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
estimated future undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset
are less than its carrying amount. An impairment loss is
measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds its fair value.

Instruments

– Instruments are hand held devices
used by orthopaedic surgeons during total joint replacement and
other surgical procedures. Instruments are recognized as
long-lived assets and are included in property, plant and
equipment. Undeployed instruments are carried at cost, net of
allowances for excess and obsolete instruments. Instruments in
the field are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
average estimated useful lives, determined principally in
reference to associated product life cycles, primarily five
years. We review instruments for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 144. Depreciation of instruments is
recognized as selling, general and administrative expense.

Goodwill

– We account for goodwill in
accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”. Goodwill is not amortized but is
subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill has been assigned
to reporting units, which are consistent with our operating
segments. We perform annual impairment tests by comparing each
reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying amount to
determine if there is potential impairment. If the fair value of
the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an
impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair
value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying
value of the reporting unit goodwill. The fair value of the
reporting unit and the implied fair value of goodwill are
determined based upon discounted cash flows, market multiples or
appraised values as appropriate.

Intangible Assets

– We account for intangible
assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Intangible
assets with an indefinite life, including certain trademarks and
trade names, are not amortized. The useful lives of indefinite
life intangible assets are assessed annually to determine
whether events and circumstances continue to support an
indefinite life. Intangible assets with a finite life, including
core and developed technology, certain trademarks and trade
names, customer related intangibles and patents and licenses are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
life, ranging from seven to thirty years. Intangible assets with
an indefinite life are tested for impairment annually, or
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the
asset. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be
determined based upon the excess of the asset’s carrying
value over its fair value. Intangible assets with a finite life
are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

The useful lives of intangible assets range from 3 to
40 years. In determining the useful lives of intangible
assets, we consider the expected use of the assets and the
effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, anticipated
technological advances, changes in surgical techniques, market
influences and other economic factors. For technology based
intangible assets, we consider the expected product life cycles
of products, absent unforeseen technological advances, which
incorporate the corresponding technology. Trademarks and trade
names that do not have a wasting characteristic (i.e. there are
no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or
other factors which limit the useful life) are assigned an
indefinite life. Trademarks and trade names that are related to
products expected to be phased out are assigned lives consistent
with the period in which the products bearing each brand are
expected to be sold. For customer relationship intangible
assets, we assign useful lives based upon historical levels of
customer attrition.

Research and Development

– We expense all
research and development costs as incurred. Research and
development costs include salaries, prototypes, depreciation



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

of equipment used in research and development, consultant fees
and amounts paid to collaborative partners.

Income Taxes

– We account for income taxes in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. Federal income taxes are
provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries
that is expected to be remitted to the U.S.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– We account
for all derivative financial instruments in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by
SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133)” and SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities”. SFAS No. 133 requires that
all derivative instruments be reported as assets or liabilities
on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. We maintain
written policies and procedures that permit, under appropriate
circumstances and subject to proper authorization, the use of
derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes.
The use of derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes is prohibited. We are exposed to market
risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. As a result, we
utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effect
of exchange rate fluctuations on anticipated foreign currency
transactions, generally intercompany sales and purchases
expected to occur within the next twelve to thirty months.
Derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are
designated as such from inception. We maintain formal
documentation regarding our objectives, the nature of the risk
being hedged, identification of the instrument, the hedged
transaction, the hedging relationship and how effectiveness of
the hedging instrument will be assessed. Our policy requires
that critical terms of a hedging instrument are essentially the
same as a hedged forecasted transaction. On this basis, with
respect to a cash flow hedge, changes in cash flows attributable
to the hedged transaction are generally expected to be
completely offset by the cash flows attributable to hedge
instruments. We, therefore, perform quarterly assessments of
hedge effectiveness by verifying and documenting those critical
terms of the hedge instrument and that forecasted transactions
have not changed. We also assess on a quarterly basis whether
there have been adverse developments regarding the risk of a
counterparty default. For derivatives which qualify as hedges of
future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair
value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and
then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item
affects net earnings. The ineffective portion of a
derivative’s change in fair value, if any, is reported in
cost of products sold immediately. The net amount recognized in
earnings during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, due to ineffectiveness and amounts excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness, was not significant.

For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2005, we have an
obligation to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese
Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars or
purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity
dates ranging from January 2006 through May 2008. The notional
amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third
parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2005 were
$1,142.2 million. The notional amounts of outstanding
forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase
Swiss Francs at December 31, 2005 were $195.0 million.
The fair value of outstanding derivative instruments recorded on
the balance sheet at December 31, 2005, together with
settled derivatives where the hedged item has not yet affected
earnings, was a net unrealized gain of $31.1 million, or
$25.4 million net of taxes, which is deferred in other
comprehensive income, of which, $10.2 million, or
$9.2 million, net of taxes, is expected to be reclassified
to earnings over the next twelve months.

We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts
with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets
and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
entity’s functional currency. As a result, any foreign
currency translation gains/ losses recognized in earnings under
SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”
are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency
forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period.

Stock Compensation

– At December 31, 2005,
we had three stock option plans, which are described more fully
in Note 13 and an employee stock purchase plan.
Additionally, restricted stock has been granted under one of the
stock option plans. We account for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related Interpretations. For stock options
that vest based upon service, no share-based compensation cost
is reflected in net earnings, as the options granted under the
plans had exercise prices equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. We granted
performance-conditioned stock options in 2005 that require us to
recognize an expense to the extent the market value of the stock
exceeds the exercise price on the measurement date. No
compensation cost was recognized in the year ended
December 31, 2005, as the exercise price exceeded the
market value of the stock. No compensation cost is reflected in
net income for the employee stock purchase plan under the
provisions of APB 25, which allows a discounted purchase price
under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Compensation cost related to restricted stock is recognized in
earnings over the vesting period of the stock, which is
generally five years. Compensation cost related to restricted
stock was not significant for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003. The following table illustrates the effect



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

on net earnings and earnings per share if we had applied the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,” to the
above plans.

The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following assumptions:

The weighted average fair value for options granted during 2005,
2004 and 2003 was $28.11, $21.85 and $12.85, respectively.

Other Comprehensive Income

– Other
comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and
losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are
included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net
earnings as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment
to stockholders’ equity. Other comprehensive income is
comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments,
unrealized foreign currency hedge gains and losses, unrealized
gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, and minimum
pension liability adjustments.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as
follows (in millions):

Treasury Stock

– We account for repurchases of
common stock under the cost method and present treasury stock as
a reduction of shareholders equity. We may reissue common stock
held in treasury only for limited purposes.

Accounting Pronouncements

– In December 2004,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”)

109-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”)”. As a result of
the Act, we could have repatriated earnings of foreign
subsidiaries at reduced U.S. tax rates in 2005. However, we
determined it was not beneficial to repatriate earnings under
the Act based upon our facts and circumstances and therefore
this did not have an effect on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment”, which is a revision to
SFAS No. 123. SFAS 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including stock options, to
be expensed based on their fair values. We have disclosed the
effect on net earnings and earnings per share if we had applied
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123. We will
adopt SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the
prospective method and will not restate prior periods.
SFAS 123(R) will apply to new awards and to awards that are
outstanding as of January 1, 2006. Compensation expense for
outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not been
rendered as of January 1, 2006, will be recognized over the
remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated
for pro forma disclosure purposes under SFAS 123. We
estimate the adoption of this accounting standard will reduce
diluted earnings per share by $0.23 – $0.25 during the
year ended December 31, 2006.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs” to clarify the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense.
SFAS No. 151 requires that fixed overhead production
costs be applied to inventory at “normal capacity” and
any excess fixed overhead production costs be charged to expense
in the period in which they were incurred.
SFAS No. 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. We do not expect
SFAS No. 151 to have a material effect on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”, which is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2005. This standard is a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20,
“Accounting Changes”. SFAS No. 154 changes
the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in
accounting principle. We do not expect SFAS No. 154 to
have a material effect on our financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

ACQUISITIONS

Centerpulse AG and InCentive Capital AG

On October 2, 2003 (the “Closing Date”), we
closed our exchange offer for Centerpulse, a global orthopaedic
medical



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2005 FORM 10-K

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

device company headquartered in Switzerland that services the
reconstructive joint, spine and dental implant markets. We also
closed our exchange offer for InCentive, a company that, at the
Closing Date, owned only cash and beneficially owned
18.3 percent of the issued Centerpulse shares. The primary
reason for making the Centerpulse and InCentive exchange offers
was to create a global leader in the design, development,
manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive
implants, including joint and dental, spine implants, and trauma
products. The combined strategic compatibilities of products and
technologies is expected to provide significant earnings power
and a strong platform from which we can actively pursue growth
opportunities in the industry. Centerpulse provided a unique
platform for growth and diversification in Europe as well as in
the spine and dental areas of the medical device industry. The
aggregate consideration paid in the exchange offers was
$3,495.7 million, consisting of Zimmer Holdings common
stock valued at $2,252.0 million (45,101,640 shares
exchanged), $1,201.3 million of cash and $42.4 million
of direct acquisition costs.

Accordingly, Centerpulse and InCentive results of operations
have been included in our consolidated results of operations
subsequent to the Closing Date, and their respective assets and
liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values in our
consolidated statement of financial position as of the Closing
Date, with the excess purchase price being allocated to goodwill.

As of the Closing Date, we recorded a $75.7 million
integration liability consisting of $53.1 million of
employee termination and relocation costs and $22.6 million
of sales agent and lease contract termination costs. In
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”)

95-3

“Recognition of Liabilities Assumed in a Purchase Business
Combination”, these liabilities were included in the
allocation of the purchase price. Increases to the liability
subsequent to the completion of the allocation period are
expensed in the financial statements, and were not significant.
Reductions in the liability subsequent to the completion of the
allocation period are recorded as adjustments to goodwill.

Our integration plan covers all functional business areas,
including sales force, research and development, manufacturing
and administrative. Approximately 830 Centerpulse employees
have been or will be involuntarily terminated through our
integration plan. As of December 31, 2005, approximately
810 Centerpulse employees had been involuntarily
terminated. We completed the production phase-out of our Austin,
Texas manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of 2005. The
phase-out resulted in the involuntary termination of
approximately 550 employees, including 390 employees
involved in manufacturing. Products previously manufactured at
the Austin facility are being sourced from our other
manufacturing facilities. We have hired additional manufacturing
employees at our other manufacturing facilities to handle
increased production schedules. A majority of our integration
plan has been completed as of December 31, 2005. Remaining
portions of the integration plan include IT systems
conversions, primarily in Europe and Asia Pacific,
decommissioning the Austin facility and disposing of this asset,
continued in-sourcing and a few other items. Reconciliation of
the integration liability, as of December 31, 2005, is as
follow (in millions):

Implex Corp.

On April 23, 2004, we acquired Implex, a privately held
orthopaedics company based in New Jersey, pursuant to an Amended
and Restated Merger Agreement. We acquired 100 percent of
the shares of Implex for an initial cash consideration of
approximately $108.0 million, before adjustments for debt
repayment, certain payments previously made by us to Implex
pursuant to a pre-existing strategic alliance and other items.
The aggregate cash consideration paid by us through
December 31, 2005 was $197.2 million, consisting of a
$98.6 million payment at closing, $2.6 million of
direct acquisition costs and $96.0 million of earn-out
payments made pursuant to the merger agreement. The acquisition
resulted from the strategic alliance agreement we had with
Implex since 2000 for the development and distribution of
reconstructive implant and trauma products incorporating

Trabecular Metal

Technology.

The merger agreement contains provisions for additional annual
cash earn-out payments that are based on year-over-year sales
growth through 2006 of certain products that incorporate

Trabecular Metal

Technology. We estimate an additional
$30 – $40 million of earn-out payments will be
made in 2006. These earn-out payments represent contingent
consideration and, in accordance with SFAS No. 141 and
EITF

95-8

“Accounting for Contingent Consideration Paid to the
Shareholders of an Acquired Enterprise in a Purchase Business
Combination”, are recorded as an additional cost of the
transaction upon resolution of the contingency and therefore
increase goodwill.

We completed the purchase price allocation in 2005 in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
only significant adjustment to the preliminary purchase price
allocation made in 2005 related to a $44.1 million earn-out
payment. See Note 7 for additional information on goodwill.

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our method of
accounting for instruments. Prior to January 1, 2003,
undeployed instruments were carried as a prepaid expense at
cost, net of allowances for excess and obsolete instruments, and
recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in the
year in which the instruments were placed into service. The new
method of accounting for instruments was adopted to recognize
the cost of these important assets within the consolidated
balance sheet and allocate the cost of these assets over the
periods benefited, typically five years.

The effect of the change during the year ended December 31,
2003 was to increase earnings before cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle by $26.8 million
($17.8 million net of tax), or $0.08 per diluted share. The
cumulative effect adjustment of $55.1 million (net of
income taxes of $34.0 million) to retroactively apply the
new capitalization method as if applied in years prior to 2003
is included in earnings during the year ended December 31,
2003.

OTHER CURRENT AND LONG-TERM LIABILITIES

Other current and long-term liabilities at December 31,
2005 and 2004, consist of the following (in millions):

9.

DEBT

On March 31, 2005, we amended and restated our revolving
credit and term loan agreement dated as of May 24, 2004
(the “Prior Facility”) into a five year
$1,350 million amended and restated credit agreement (the
“Amended and Restated Facility”). The Amended and
Restated Facility is a revolving, multi-currency, senior
unsecured credit facility maturing March 31, 2010.
Available borrowings under the Amended and Restated Facility at
December 31, 2005, were $1,268.4 million. The Amended
and Restated Facility contains a provision whereby borrowings
may be increased to $1,750 million.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign and domestic
subsidiaries are the borrowers and our wholly owned domestic
subsidiaries are the guarantors of the Amended and Restated
Facility. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Facility
bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus an applicable margin
determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term credit
rating and the amounts drawn under the Amended and Restated
Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a fixed rate
determined through a competitive bid process. The Amended and
Restated Facility contains customary affirmative and negative
covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing
arrangement, including, among other things, limitations on
consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. Financial covenants
include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum
interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If we fall below an
investment grade credit rating, additional restrictions would
result, including restrictions on investments, payment of
dividends and stock repurchases. We were in compliance with all
covenants under the Amended and Restated Facility as of
December 31, 2005. Commitments under the Amended and
Restated Facility are subject to certain fees, including a
facility and a utilization fee.

Outstanding debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 consists
of the following (in millions):

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
$65 million.

The weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the
Amended and Restated Facility is 0.41 percent at
December 31, 2005. Borrowings under the Amended and
Restated Facility at December 31, 2005 are Japanese Yen
based borrowings. We paid $15.3 million, $27.9 million
and

$6.3 million in interest during 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Debt issuance costs of $20.5 million were incurred to
obtain the Prior Facility arrangement and an additional
$1.9 million were incurred for the Amended and Restated
Facility. These costs were capitalized and are amortized to
interest expense over the lives of the related facilities. At
December 31, 2005, unamortized debt issuance costs were
$7.7 million.

10.

RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain U.S. and
Puerto Rico employees who were hired before September 2,
2002. Employees hired after September 2, 2002 are not part
of the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit plans, but do
receive additional benefits under our defined contribution
plans. Plan benefits are primarily based on years of credited
service and the participant’s average eligible
compensation. In addition to the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined
benefit pension plans, we sponsor various non-U.S. pension
arrangements, including retirement and termination benefit plans
required by local law or coordinated with government sponsored
plans.

We also provide comprehensive medical and group life insurance
benefits to certain U.S. and Puerto Rico eligible retirees who
elect to participate in our comprehensive medical and group life
plans. The medical plan is contributory, and the life insurance
plan is non-contributory. No similar plans exist for employees
outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Employees hired after
September 2, 2002, are not eligible for retiree medical and
life insurance benefits.

We use a December 31 measurement date for our benefit plans.

The components of net pension expense for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 for our defined benefit
retirement plans are as follows (in millions):

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets is based
on the period expected benefits will be paid and the historical
rates of return on the different asset classes held in the
plans. The expected long-term rate of return is the weighted
average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset
class. We believe that historical asset results approximate
expected market returns applicable to the funding of a long-term
benefit obligation.

Discount rates were determined for each of our defined benefit
retirement plans at their measurement date to reflect the yield
of a portfolio of high quality bonds matched against the timing
and amounts of projected future benefit payments.

The U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement
plans’ overall investment strategy is to maximize total
returns by emphasizing long-term growth of capital while
avoiding risk. We have established target ranges of assets held
by the plans of 50 to 75 percent for equity securities and
25 to 50 percent for debt securities. The plans strive to
have sufficiently diversified assets so that adverse or
unexpected results from one asset class will not have an unduly
detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. The investments in
the plans are rebalanced quarterly based upon the target asset
allocation of the plans.

The investment strategies of

non-U.S.

based
plans vary according to the plan provisions and local laws. The
majority of the assets in

non-U.S.

based
plans are located in Switzerland based plans. These assets are
held in trusts and are commingled with the assets of other Swiss
companies, with representatives of all the companies making the
investment decisions. The overall strategy is to maximize total
returns while avoiding risk. The trustees of the assets have
established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 30 to
50 percent in debt securities, 20 to 37 percent in
equity securities, 15 to 24 percent in real estate, 3 to
15 percent in cash funds and 0 to 12 percent in other
funds.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our defined benefit
pension plans’ assets did not hold any direct investment in
Zimmer Holdings common stock.

We expect that we will have no minimum funding requirements by
law in 2006 for the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit
retirement plans. However, we expect to voluntarily contribute
between $13 million to $18 million to these plans
during 2006. Contributions to non-U.S. defined benefit
plans are estimated to be approximately $9 million in 2006.

We also sponsor defined contribution plans for substantially all
of the U.S. and Puerto Rico employees and certain employees
in other countries. The benefits of these plans relate to local
customs and practices in the countries concerned. We expensed
$11.3 million, $6.4 million and $4.8 million
related to these plans for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

effect of a change in the healthcare cost trend rate is tempered
by an annual cap that limits medical costs we pay.

INCOME TAXES

The components of earnings before taxes consist of the following
(in millions):

Income taxes paid during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
$189.2 million, $143.3 million and
$116.1 million, respectively.

A reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to
our effective tax rate is as follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes.

The components of deferred income taxes consisted of the
following (in millions):

At December 31, 2005, the vast majority of the net
operating loss is available to reduce future federal and state
taxable earnings of the U.S. companies. These losses
generally expire within a period of 1 to 19 years.
$21.0 million of state losses are subject to valuation
allowances and certain restrictions. The tax credits are
entirely available to offset future federal and state tax
liabilities of the U.S. companies. These credits generally
expire within a 1 to 14 year period. $11.3 million of
the tax credits are subject to valuation allowances and certain
restrictions. The capital loss carryover is also available to
reduce future federal taxable earnings of the
U.S. companies; however, the entire carryover is subject to
a valuation allowance and expires within a period of 1 to
4 years.

Our former parent received a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”), that the 2001 spin-off of Zimmer
would qualify as a tax-free transaction. Such a ruling, while
generally binding upon the IRS, is subject to certain factual
representations and assumptions. We have agreed to certain
restrictions on our future actions to provide further assurances
that the spin-off will qualify as tax-free. If we fail to abide
by such restrictions and, as a result, the spin-off fails to
qualify as a tax-free transaction, we will be obligated to
indemnify our former parent for any resulting tax liability.

During 2004, our tax provision included a deferred tax benefit
of $34.5 million as a result of revaluing deferred taxes of
acquired Centerpulse operations due to a reduction in the
ongoing Swiss tax rate (from approximately 24 percent to
12.5 percent).

We have a long-term tax liability of $150.1 million at
December 31, 2005 for expected settlement of various
U.S. and foreign income tax liabilities.

At December 31, 2005, we had an aggregate of approximately
$279 million of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries
that have been, or are intended to be, permanently reinvested
for continued use in foreign operations. If the total
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted, a
significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the
allowable foreign tax credits. It is impractical for us to
determine the additional tax of remitting these earnings.

CAPITAL STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

We have 2 million shares of Series A Participating
Cumulative Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred
Stock”) authorized for issuance, none of which were
outstanding as of December 31, 2005.

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is
net earnings available to common stockholders. The denominator
for basic earnings per share is the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. The denominator for
diluted earnings per share is weighted average shares
outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options.
The following is a reconciliation of weighted average shares for
the basic and diluted share computations for the years ending

the exercise prices of these options were greater than the
average market price of the common stock. There were no
anti-dilutive options excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003.

In December 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a stock
repurchase program of up to $1 billion through
December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2005 we had
acquired approximately 59,200 shares at a cost of
$4.1 million.

13.

STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

We had three stock option plans in effect at December 31,
2005: the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, the TeamShare Stock Option
Plan and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. We have
reserved the maximum number of shares of common stock available
for award under the terms of each of these plans and have
registered 42.9 million shares of common stock. Options may
be granted under these plans at a price of not less than the
fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of
grant. The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of
nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options,
long-term performance awards, restricted stock awards and
deferred stock units. Options granted under the 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan may include stock appreciation rights. The
TeamShare Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of
non-qualified stock options and, in certain jurisdictions, stock
appreciation rights, while the Stock Plan for Non-Employee
Directors provides for awards of stock options, restricted stock
and restricted stock units to non-employee directors.

Options granted under these plans generally vest over four
years, although in no event in less than one year, and expire
ten years from the date of grant. In the past, certain options
have had price thresholds, which affect exercisability. All such
price thresholds have been satisfied.

The total number of awards which may be granted in a given year
and/or over the life of the plan under each of our stock option
plans is limited to prevent dilution. In addition, under the
terms of the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, no participant may
receive options or awards which in the aggregate exceed
2 million shares of stock over the life of the plan.

A summary of the status of all options granted to employees and
non-employee directors for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 is presented below (options in thousands):

SEGMENT DATA

We design, develop, manufacture and market reconstructive
orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal
implants, trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical
products which include surgical supplies and instruments
designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and
post-operation rehabilitation. We manage operations through
three major geographic segments  – the Americas, which
is comprised principally of the United States and includes other
North, Central and South American markets; Europe, which is
comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and
Africa; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan
and includes other Asian and Pacific markets. This structure is
the basis for our reportable segment information discussed
below. Management evaluates operating segment performance based
upon segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses
pertaining to global operations and corporate expenses,
acquisition, integration and other expenses, inventory step-up,

asset amortization expense. Global operations include research,
development engineering, medical education, brand management,
corporate legal, finance, and human resource functions, and U.S.
and Puerto Rico based manufacturing operations and logistics.
Intercompany transactions have been eliminated from segment
operating profit. Management reviews accounts receivable,
inventory, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and
intangible assets by reportable segment exclusive of U.S. and
Puerto Rico based manufacturing operations and logistics and
corporate assets.

Net sales, segment operating profit and year-end assets are as
follows (in millions):

U.S. sales were $1,845.6 million, $1,664.5 million and
$1,152.0 million for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sales to any individual
country outside of the U.S. were not significant. Sales are
attributable to a country based upon the customer’s country
of domicile. Net sales by product category are as follows (in
millions):

Capital expenditures by operating segment for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows (in
millions):

For segment reporting purposes, deployed instruments are
included in the measurement of operating segment assets while
undeployed instruments at U.S. and Puerto Rico based
manufacturing operations and logistics are included in global
operations and corporate functions. The majority of instruments
are purchased by U.S. and Puerto Rico based manufacturing
operations and logistics and are deployed to the operating
segments as needed for the business.

Depreciation and amortization used in determining operating
segment profit for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003 was as follows (in millions):

The increase in deprecation and amortization in 2004 from 2003
was primarily caused by a full year of depreciation and
amortization on Centerpulse acquired assets in 2004 versus one
quarter of depreciation and amortization in 2003.

LEASES

Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating
leases in effect as of December 31, 2005 were
$26.8 million for 2006, $20.9 million for 2007,
$18.2 million for 2008, $11.1 million for 2009,
$9.9 million for 2010 and $25.4 million thereafter.
Total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003 aggregated $27.9 million, $24.2 million
and $15.7 million, respectively.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

As a result of the Centerpulse transaction, we acquired the
entity involved in Centerpulse’s hip and knee implant
litigation matter. The litigation was a result of a voluntary
recall of certain hip and knee implants manufactured and sold by
Centerpulse. On March 13, 2002, a U.S. Class Action
Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) was
entered into by Centerpulse that resolved U.S. claims
related to the affected products and a settlement trust
(“Settlement Trust”) was established and funded for
the most part by Centerpulse. The court approved the settlement
arrangement on May 8, 2002. Under the terms of the
Settlement Agreement, we will reimburse the Settlement Trust a
specified amount for each revision surgery over 4,000 and
revisions on reprocessed shells over 64. As of February 14,
2006, the claims administrator has received 4,135 likely valid
claims for hips (cut-off date June 5, 2003) and knees
(cut-off date November 17, 2003) and 201 claims for
reprocessed shells (cut-off date September 8, 2004). We
believe the litigation liability recorded as of
December 31, 2005 is adequate to provide for any future
claims regarding the hip and knee implant litigation.

On February 15, 2005, Howmedica Osteonics Corp.
(“Howmedica”) filed an action against us and an
unrelated party in the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey alleging infringement by the defendants
of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934; 6,372,814; 6,664,308;
and 6,818,020. Howmedica’s complaint seeks unspecified
damages and injunctive relief. On April 14, 2005, we filed
our answer to the complaint denying Howmedica’s
allegations. Discovery is ongoing. We believe that our defenses
are valid and meritorious and we intend to defend the Howmedica
lawsuit vigorously.

We are also subject to product liability and other claims and
lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, for which
we maintain insurance, subject to self-insured retention limits.
We establish accruals for product liability and other claims in
conjunction with outside counsel based on current information
and historical settlement information for open claims, related
fees and for claims incurred but not reported. While it is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases,
it is the opinion of management that, upon ultimate resolution,
these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

On July 25, 2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission informed Centerpulse that it was conducting an
informal investigation of Centerpulse relating to certain
accounting issues. We are continuing to fully cooperate with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in this matter.

On March 31, 2005, we received a subpoena from the United
States Department of Justice through the United States
Attorney’s Office in Newark, New Jersey, requesting that we
produce documents for the period beginning January 2002 through
March 2005 pertaining to consulting contracts, professional
service agreements and other agreements by which we may provide
remuneration to orthopaedic surgeons. We have produced documents
in response to the subpoena. We are cooperating fully with
federal authorities with regard to this matter. We understand
that similar inquiries were

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures and
internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable
assurance that material information relating to us, including
our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known on a timely basis
to management and the Board of Directors. However, any control
system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide
absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are
met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, within a company have been detected.

Based on their evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report are effective. Management’s report on internal
control over financial reporting appears in this report at the
conclusion of Item 7A.

There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in
Rule

13a-15(f))

that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9B.

Other Information

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors did not approve the engagement of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public
accounting firm, to perform any non-audit services. This
disclosure is made pursuant to Section 10A(i)(2) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by Section 202 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The Zimmer Holdings, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan was
amended effective January 1, 2006. A copy of the plan as
amended is being filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission as Exhibit 99.2 to this report.
