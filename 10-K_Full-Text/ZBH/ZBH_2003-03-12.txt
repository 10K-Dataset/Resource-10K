Part I

ITEM 1.

Business

GENERAL

Zimmer Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation,
was incorporated on January 12, 2001, as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company as part of a
previously announced plan by Bristol-Myers Squibb to create a
separate company relating to the design, development,
manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive
implants, trauma products and other products used for
orthopaedic and general surgery. Zimmer, Inc., the
Company’s predecessor founded in 1927, was acquired by
Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1972 and along with its wholly-owned
subsidiaries and certain other Bristol-Myers Squibb operations
comprised the orthopaedics business of Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms
“Company” and “Zimmer” as used herein refer
to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and the
predecessor orthopaedics business operated under Bristol-Myers
Squibb.

On July 25, 2001, Bristol-Myers Squibb
transferred the assets and liabilities of its orthopaedic
business to the Company. On August 6, 2001, Bristol-Myers
Squibb distributed all of the shares of the Company’s
common stock to Bristol-Myers Squibb stockholders in the form of
a dividend of one share of Company common stock, and the
associated preferred stock purchase right, for every ten shares
of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock (“Distribution”
or “Separation”). Bristol-Myers Squibb received a
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the transfer of
the orthopaedic business to the Company and the subsequent
distribution of all Company common stock to Bristol-Myers Squibb
stockholders qualified as a tax free transaction.

The Company’s Internet website is
www.zimmer.com. The Company’s annual reports on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed
or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act are available or may be accessed free of charge through the
Investor Relations section of the Company’s internet
website as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company
electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the
SEC. The Company’s internet website and the information
contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be
incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS

The Company has operations in 20 countries
and markets products in more than 70 countries, with
headquarters in Warsaw, Indiana, and manufacturing, distribution
and warehousing and/or office facilities in more than
50 locations worldwide. The Company manages its operations
through three major geographic areas – the Americas,
which is comprised principally of the United States and includes
other North, Central and South American markets; Asia Pacific,
which is comprised primarily of Japan and includes other Asian
and Pacific markets; and Europe, which is comprised principally
of Europe and includes the Middle East and Africa. Information
about geographic segments can be found in Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included herein
under Item 8.

Company products are distributed in these regions
primarily through networks of agents and distributors who market
and sell to orthopaedic surgeons, third party distributors,
hospitals and surgery centers, among others.

The Company’s primary customers include
orthopaedic surgeons, hospitals and healthcare purchasing
organizations or buying groups. These customers range from
large multinational enterprises to independent surgeons. A
majority of U.S. hospitals and surgeons belong to at least one
group purchasing organization. No individual end user accounted
for over 1.0 percent of net sales.

The Company utilizes more than 1,300 sales
associates, sales managers and support personnel, some of whom
are employed by independent distributors. The Company invests
a significant amount of time and expense in providing
training in such areas as product features and benefits, how to
use specific products and how to best assist surgeons. The
presence of sales representatives is deemed by surgeons and
hospitals to be necessary in a high number of procedures and the
extensive sales training provided by the Company enables
representatives, when requested, to make meaningful
contributions during surgeries. Sales force representatives rely
heavily on strong technical selling skills, medical education
and in-surgery staff technical support.

In response to the different healthcare systems
throughout the world, the Company’s sales and marketing
strategies and organizational structures differ by region. The
Company has, however, carefully integrated a global approach to
salesforce training, marketing and medical education into
each locality to provide consistent, high quality service.
The Company sponsors more than 300 medical education events each
year for and with orthopaedic surgeons around the world.

The Americas is the largest region, accounting
for approximately 68 percent of 2002 sales, with the United
States accounting for the vast majority of sales in this region.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2002 FORM 10-K

The U.S. salesforce consists of
26 independent distributors with more than 650 sales
associates, sales managers and sales support personnel, all of
whom sell Company products exclusively. Also, the Company has
concentrated on negotiating contracts with buying groups and
managed care accounts and has increased unit growth by linking
the level of discount received to sales growth.

The Asia Pacific region accounted for
approximately 20 percent of 2002 sales with Japan being the
largest foreign market, accounting for the majority of sales in
this region. In Japan and most countries in the Asia
Pacific region, the Company maintains a network of dealers and
approximately 400 sales associates and sales support
personnel who build and maintain strong relationships with
leading orthopaedic surgeons in their markets.

The European region accounted for approximately
12 percent of 2002 sales, with France, Germany, Italy,
Spain and the United Kingdom accounting for approximately
75 percent of sales in the region. In addition, the Company
also operates in other key markets such as the Benelux, Nordic,
Switzerland and emerging regions such as Russia, Central Europe,
and Mediterranean markets. The Company’s salesforce in this
region is also comprised of independent distributors,
commissioned agents, and approximately 200 direct sales
associates and sales support personnel.

PRODUCTS

The Company is a global leader in the design,
development, manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic
reconstructive implants and trauma products. Orthopaedic
reconstructive implants restore joint function lost due to
disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders, and
elbows. Trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach
or stabilize damaged bone or tissue to support the body’s
natural healing process. The Company also manufactures and
markets orthopaedic surgical products which include surgical
supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical
procedures.

Reconstructive Implants

Reconstructive implants restore joint function
lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips,
shoulders and elbows. The majority of reconstructive implant
procedures restores joint function lost due to degenerative
diseases such as arthritis and relieve pain in knees and hips.

Knee Implants

Total knee surgeries typically include a femoral
component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an
articulating surface (placed on the tibial tray).

Knee replacement surgeries include first-time
joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the
replacement, repair or enhancement of an implant product or
component from a previous procedure. Knee implants are designed
to accommodate different levels of ligament stabilization of the
joint. While some knee implant designs, called cruciate
retaining designs, require the retention of the posterior
cruciate ligament, other designs, called posterior stabilized
designs, provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate
ligament. There are also procedures for partial reconstruction
of the knee, which treat limited knee degeneration and involve
the replacement of only one side or compartment of the knee with
a unicompartmental knee prosthesis. The Company offers a wide
range of products for specialized knee procedures, including the
following brands:

NexGen

®
    Complete Knee Solution. The

NexGen

knee product line is a
    comprehensive system for knee replacement surgery with a leading
    position in posterior stabilized and revision procedures. The

NexGen

knee system offers joint stability and sizing that
    can be tailored to individual patient needs while providing
    surgeons with a unified system of interchangeable
    components. The

NexGen

knee system provides surgeons with
    complete and versatile knee instrument options, including
    milling and multiple saw blade cutting instrument systems. The
    breadth and versatility of the

NexGen

knee system allows
    surgeons to change from one type of implant to another during
    surgery, according to the needs of the patient, and to support
    current surgical philosophies. The recent addition of

Trabecular Metal

TM

tibial implants in both
    cruciate retaining and posterior stabilizing philosophies
    continues the Company’s strategy to add new innovative
    technologies to this leading brand.

Trabecular Metal

is
    a material that provides a dramatically higher level of
    porosity than existing alternatives, is similar in stiffness and
    friction to natural bone and is believed to be a major
    advancement in orthopaedic materials. The

Trabecular Metal

technology is distributed by the Company under an exclusive
    distribution and strategic alliance with Implex Corporation, as
    further described herein under Intellectual Property.

The

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution

Legacy

® Knee-Posterior Stabilized product line
    provides stability in the absence of the posterior cruciate
    ligament. The posterior stabilized capabilities have recently
    been augmented through the introduction of the

NexGen Legacy

Posterior Stabilized Flex Knee, a high-flexion implant that
    can potentially safely accommodate knee flexion up to a
    155-degree range of motion in some patients when implanted using
    a specialized surgical technique.

The

NexGen

Revision knee product line,
    consisting of LCCK, RHK and CRA revision knee products, is
    designed with extensive options to accommodate the variable
    needs in revision procedures. These products accommodate more
    difficult procedures and are augmentable for bone loss and
    provide increased constraint for patients with ligamentous
    instability. During 2002, the Rotating Hinge Knee was added to
    the line for optimal constraint in more severe cases.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

M/G

™
    Unicompartmental Knee System. The

M/G

uni system boasts a
    98 percent implant survival rate post-surgery at
    10 years and applies the same flexibility and quality of
    our other knee implant products to unicompartmental, or single
    compartment disease. The

M/G

uni system’s patented
    minimally invasive intramedullary instrumentation, as well as
    its new minimally invasive extramedullary instrumentation,
    offers accurate alignment, precise cuts and secure fixation that
    provide surgeons with the ability to accurately and efficiently
    repair damage to joint surfaces of one knee compartment with
    predictable, reproducible results through a small incision. The
    new minimally invasive instrumentation for the

M/G

uni
    system positions the Company to continue to lead and to
    capitalize on growing trends toward less invasive surgical
    procedures.

Prolong

™ Highly
    Crosslinked Polyethylene Articular Surfaces. The

Prolong

polyethylene is a new bearing surface material for total
    knee replacement. In certain laboratory tests that simulate
    joint function, it demonstrates reduced resistance to
    delamination compared to current standard polyethylene bearing
    material. The Food and Drug Administration has approved the
    additional claim of “resistance to delamination” for
    the

Prolong

polyethylene product. Most knee articulating
    surfaces only receive the more general “resistance to
    wear” claim that clearly does not definitively address the
    primary mode of failure in knees, which is sub-surface fatigue.

Hip Implants

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the
head of the femur and the socket portion of the pelvis
(acetabulum) of the natural hip and include first time
joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the
replacement, repair or enhancement of an implant product or
component from a previous procedure. The femur is the long bone
between the pelvis and the knee. The acetabulum is the
cup-shaped portion of the pelvis. Historically, most hip implant
procedures have involved the use of bone cement to attach the
prosthetic components to the surrounding bone. Today, many
femoral and acetabulum cup replacement components are porous
which means they do not require bone cement because bone can
actually grow into, and onto, the implant surface. The
Company’s hip replacement products are among the
industry’s leading brands, which include:

history, including the application of fiber
metal, a titanium fiber mesh to biologically fix implants; these
are porous implants that do not require bone cement because bone
can actually grow into, and onto, the implant surface. The
Company has and continues to augment its offerings of porous
reconstructive hip implants through the introduction of

Trabecular Metal

technology, a material that provides a
dramatically higher level of porosity than existing
alternatives, is similar in stiffness and friction to natural
bone and is believed to be a major advancement in orthopaedic
materials.

Minimally Invasive
    Solutions

™
    (

“MIS”

). In 2001, the Company announced that it
    had established a dedicated business team to maximize the
    potential patient benefits of applying minimally invasive
    surgical techniques to orthopaedic surgery. A distinct medical
    education process, The Zimmer Institute, with a 15,000 square
    foot facility located in the Company’s global headquarters,
    will open in early 2003 and will facilitate the training
    for surgeons, sales associates and other medical professionals
    required for these innovative

MIS

procedures. The Company
    is currently working with several global medical centers to
    evaluate and refine advanced minimally invasive knee and hip
    replacement procedures. The goals of these efforts are to reduce
    the hardships of having a total hip replacement, such as the
    time a patient must spend in rehabilitation, pain reduction and
    reduced lost time from work. The Company’s

MIS

business team will focus both on further commercializing
    existing minimally invasive approaches and investigating ways to
    apply minimally invasive principles to additional procedures.
    One of the surgical approaches employed for the

MIS

hip procedure uses two small portals, each approximately two
    inches in length. Standard implants are used in the procedure.
    The incision for a traditional, open hip replacement is as much
    as 12 inches long. Other less invasive approaches such as a
    “mini” incision for hips have been in place for four
    years with “mini” knees under development. An

MIS

total knee procedure is in full development. The
    Company plans to double its investment in

MIS

in 2003 to
    more than $20 million.

Other Reconstructive Implants

The Coonrad/ Morrey product line is a leading
family of elbow replacement implant products and the

Bigliani/ Flatow

® The Complete Shoulder Solution
product line gives the Company a significant share of the global
shoulder implant market. These systems are designed to treat
arthritic conditions and fractures as well as to enhance the
outcome of primary or revision surgery. Both systems offer
surgeons a wide variety of implants and instrumentation to
accommodate differing surgical philosophies and patient needs
with continued innovative line extensions being introduced to
the market for continued growth of these leading brands.

Trauma

Trauma products include devices used primarily to
reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the
body’s natural healing process. The most common surgical
stabilization of bone fracture involves the internal fixation of
bone fragments. This stabilization can involve the use of a wide
assortment of plates, screws, rods, wires and pins. In addition,
tissue attachment devices are used to treat soft tissue trauma.
The Company offers a comprehensive line of products
designed for use in the fixation of fractures, including hip
fixation products, plates, screws, pins, wires and nails. The
recently expanded trauma product line enables the Company to
offer surgeons cost-effective quality products, including:

Zimmer

Cannulated
    Screws. A full range of cannulated screws utilizing

Biodur

®


108 stainless steel is the
    first product line on the market utilizing the new high strength
    stainless steel. The strength allows larger cannulation which
    permits larger guide wires making surgery easier to perform.

Orthopaedic Surgical Products

The Company manufactures and markets other
surgical products, which surgeons use for both orthopaedic and
non-orthopaedic procedures, including tourniquets, blood
management systems, wound debridement products, powered
instruments for use in surgical procedures, traction devices and
orthopaedic softgoods, which provide support and/or compression
for trauma of the knee, ankle, back and upper extremities,
including the shoulder, elbow, neck and wrist. The Company has
developed and intends to continue developing, technologically
advanced surgical products to support its reconstructive implant
and trauma product systems in the operating room environment
with a focus on blood and pain management systems.

function is integrated with strategic brand marketing and
manufacturing efforts, which allows the Company to understand
its customers’ needs and to respond more quickly with
top-quality products. The rapid commercialization of innovative
new materials, product designs and surgical techniques, one of
the Company’s core strategies, has been an important driver
of sales growth in recent years.

New products, procedures, techniques and
instruments introduced since 2000 include:

These and other new products introduced in the
past 36 months accounted for 18 percent of 2002 total
sales, consistent with the Company’s goal of 15% to 20% on
annual basis.

ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the
Company spent $80.7 million, $71.6 million and
$52.0 million, respectively, on research and development.
The increase in research and development expenditures has
accelerated the output of new reconstructive implant and trauma
products including advanced new materials, product designs and
surgical techniques. The Company’s primary research and
development facility is located in Warsaw, Indiana, and employs
more than 340 research and development employees.

The Company will continue to identify and
capitalize on external sources of innovative technologies
through possible acquisitions of other complementary products,
businesses, technology licensing arrangements and strategic
alliances. During 2001 the Company announced the creation of a
medical education process, The Zimmer Institute, to help
facilitate training for surgeons, sales associates and other
medical professionals on the procedures for applying minimally
invasive surgical techniques to orthopaedic surgery.
In connection with this, the Company is working with major
medical centers to evaluate and refine advanced minimally
invasive hip and knee replacement and procedures. In addition,
the Company has developed and maintains close relationships with
a number of widely recognized orthopaedic surgeons who assist in
product research and development.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

The Company is subject to government regulation
with regard to its products and operations in the countries in
which it operates. It is the policy of the Company to comply
fully with all regulatory requirements applicable to its
products and operations.

In the United States, multiple regulations govern
the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical
devices, including among others, the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act and regulations issued or proposed there under. The
Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates
laboratory and manufacturing practices, labeling and record
keeping for medical devices and review of required
manufacturers’ reports of adverse experience to identify
potential problems with marketed medical devices. A few of the
devices developed and marketed by the Company are in a category
for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical
investigation and pre-market approval requirements. The FDA has
the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical
devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical
devices; or order the repair, replacement or refund of the costs
of such devices. There are also certain requirements of state,
local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the
manufacture and marketing of the Company’s products.

In many of the foreign countries in which the
Company markets its products, it is subject to local regulations
affecting, among other things, product standards, packaging
requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions.
Many of the regulations applicable to the Company’s devices
and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA.
The member countries of the European Union have adopted the
European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of
medical device regulations for all member countries. These
regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and
distribute medical devices in European Union member countries to
obtain Community European (CE) marks for their products. The
Company has authorization to place the CE mark on products it
distributes in European Union countries.

Regulatory requirements affecting the Company and
its products have continued to increase. It is the policy of the
Company to comply with all regulatory requirements governing its
operations and products; and the Company believes that the
manufacturing, quality control and internal control procedures
that it employs meet the requirements of the regulations in all
material respects.

Government agencies and legislative bodies in the
United States and throughout the world influence reimbursement
rates to varying degrees. The Company believes that its
experience in dealing with governmental regulatory requirements,
its efficient means of distribution and its emphasis on the
ongoing development of efficacious and technologically advanced
products should enable it to continue to compete effectively
within this regulated environment.

The orthopaedic industry is subject to various
government regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse,
including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws.
Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil
sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and
exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs,
including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration
(VA) health programs and Civilian Health and Medical
Program Uniformed Service (CHAMPUS). The scope and enforcement
of these laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to rapid
change, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent
and regulations. The Company believes that its operations are in
material compliance with these laws.

The Company’s facilities and operations are
subject to various government environmental and occupational
health and safety requirements of the United States and foreign
countries, including those relating to discharges of substances
in the air, water and land, the handling, storage and disposal
of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants. The
Company believes it is currently in material compliance with
such requirements.

COMPETITION

The orthopaedics industry is highly competitive.
In the global markets for reconstructive implants, trauma
and orthopaedic surgical products, major competitors include:
J&J DePuy Orthopaedics (a subsidiary of
Johnson & Johnson); Biomet, Inc.; Stryker Corp.;
Smith & Nephew, Inc.; Centerpulse Ltd. and
Synthes-Stratec. Competition within the industry is primarily
based on technology, quality, reputation, customer relationships
and service.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2002 FORM 10-K

In the Americas, J&J DePuy, Biomet, Inc.
and Stryker Corp., along with the Company, account for a large
majority of the total reconstructive implant sales.

In the Asia Pacific market for reconstructive
implant and trauma products, the Company competes primarily
with J&J DePuy and Stryker Corp. as well as regional
companies, including Kyocera and MDM. Factors, such as the
dealer system, complex regulatory environments and the
accompanying inability to compete on price, make it difficult
for smaller companies, particularly those that are non-regional,
to compete effectively with the market leaders in the Asia
Pacific region.

In Europe the reconstructive implant and trauma
product markets are more fragmented than the Americas or the
Asia Pacific regions. The variety of philosophies held by
European surgeons regarding hip reconstruction, for example, has
allowed for the survival of many small, niche European
companies. Today most hip implants sold in Europe are products
developed specifically for Europe, although global products are
gaining acceptance. Therefore, the Company, in addition to its
global products, will continue to develop and produce specially
tailored products to meet specific European needs. The Company
believes it is a leading player in this region in the
reconstructive implant market.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The Company believes that patents and other
proprietary rights are important to the success of its business
and also relies upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing
technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop
and maintain its competitive position. The Company protects its
proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including
confidentiality agreements and proprietary information
agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who
may have access to proprietary information.

The Company owns more than 690 issued patents and
over 400 pending patent applications and has licensed more than
450 issued patents and over 300 pending patent applications that
relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of its
products. Also, the Company is a party to several license
agreements with unrelated third parties pursuant to which it has
obtained, for the life of the licensed patent, the exclusive or
non-exclusive rights to these patents in consideration for
royalty payments, including highly crosslinked polyethylene. In
August 2000 the Company entered into an exclusive
distribution and strategic alliance agreement with Implex
Corporation, relating to the development and distribution of
reconstructive implant and trauma products incorporating

Trabecular Metal

technology. This agreement provides the
Company with an exclusive right, subject to specified conditions
beginning with the third quarter of 2003, to purchase specified
assets and proprietary rights of the Implex Corporation
utilizing a predefined process.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2002, the Company employed
more than 3,600 employees worldwide including more than 340
employees dedicated to research and development. Approximately
2,700 employees are located within the United States and 900
employees are located outside of the United States, primarily in
Japan and throughout Europe. Approximately 200 North American
employees are members of a trade union covered by a collective
bargaining agreement. In addition, approximately 10 employees
are represented by a union in the United Kingdom.

In May 2000, the Company renewed a
collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of
America covering employees at the Dover, Ohio, facility. This
agreement is effective until May 15, 2003, and is
automatically renewed on a year-to-year basis until either party
gives a written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement,
60 days prior to a termination date. The Company believes
that its relationship with its employees and the unions that
represent them is good.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking
statements.

OVERVIEW

The Company is a global leader in the design,
development, manufacture and marketing of orthopaedic
reconstructive implants and trauma products. Orthopaedic
reconstructive implants restore joint function lost due to
disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and
elbows. Trauma products are devices used primarily to reattach
or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s
natural healing process. The Company also manufactures and
markets surgical products for orthopaedic and general surgery.
With operations in 20 countries and products marketed in
70 countries, operations are managed through three
geographic regions – the Americas, Asia Pacific and
Europe.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year Ended December 31, 2002

Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Net sales for the year ended December 31,
2002, increased 16 percent. Sales growth reflected strong
demand for the Company’s reconstructive implants, including
the

NexGen

line of knee products and the

VerSys

Hip System. New products launched within the last
36 months represented 18 percent of total sales,
including the successful recent launches of key products
including the

Prolong

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene for

NexGen

Cruciate Retaining Knee, the

Trabecular Metal

Monoblock tibials, the Rotating Hinge Knee and the

Trabecular Metal

acetabular cups. Favorable demographics
helped drive increased surgical procedures in all regions, with
the Company’s largest operating segment, the Americas, as
well as Europe, leading the overall outstanding results. The
increase was comprised of a 12 percent increase due to
incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales and a
4 percent increase due to higher average selling prices.

Net sales in the Americas increased
18 percent for the year to $932.9 million compared to
2001. This increase was comprised of a 13 percent increase
due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product
sales, together with a 5 percent increase due to higher
average selling prices. Sales of reconstructive implants
increased by 21 percent with strong sales in all
categories. Knee sales increased 24 percent led by growth
in sales of

sales increased 17 percent driven by continued conversion
to porous stems,

Trabecular Metal

acetabular cups, and
increased sales of

Trilogy

Acetabular System cups
incorporating

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene
Liners. Trauma product sales increased 10 percent for the
year in large part due to increased sales of the

Zimmer

Periarticular Plating System and the

Zimmer

Plates
and Screws.

Net sales in Asia Pacific increased
6 percent (increased 8 percent constant currency) for
the year to $269.6 million. This increase was comprised of a
7 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in
the mix of product sales and 1 percent increase due to
higher average selling prices, offset by a 2 percent
decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Knee sales
increased 9 percent (increased 11 percent constant
currency) reflecting continued strong growth in the

NexGen
Legacy

Posterior Stabilized Flex Knee. Hip sales increased
11 percent (increased 14 percent constant currency)
driven primarily by the continued conversion to porous stems and
sales of

Trilogy

Acetabular System cups

incorporating

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked
Polyethylene Liners. Trauma product sales decreased
13 percent (decreased 10 percent constant currency)
reflecting a decline in

M/DN

® Intramedullary
Fixation nails and compression hip screw sales, primarily in
Japan.

Net sales in Europe increased 28 percent
(increased 23 percent constant currency) to
$169.9 million. The strong sales reflected high demand on
reconstructive implants. Eastern Europe, Finland, France,
Scandinavia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom all achieved
higher than 30 percent growth in reconstructive implant
sales. This increase was comprised of 20 percent due to
incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales, a
3 percent increase due to higher average selling prices and
a 5 percent increase due to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. Knee sales increased 27 percent (increased
22 percent constant currency) driven by strong sales of the

NexGen Legacy

system of knee prostheses, including the
Flex Knee, the

M/G

Unicompartmental Knee with

MIS

Instrumentation, and the recently launched Rotating Hinge
Knee. Hip sales increased 33 percent (increased
28 percent constant currency) driven by strong sales of

Trilogy

Acetabular System cups incorporating

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners,

VerSys

porous
stems, supported by the

ZMR

Modular Revision Hip System
and

Trabecular Metal

acetabular cups.

Overall, worldwide reconstructive implant sales
increased 20 percent (increased 20 percent constant
currency) to $1,061.7 million. Knee sales increased by
22 percent (increased 21 percent constant currency) to
$586.1 million, led by

NexGen Legacy

Posterior
Stabilized Knee including the Flex Knee,

NexGen Trabecular
Metal

tibial components, the

NexGen

Cruciate
Retaining Knee with

Prolong

Highly Crosslinked
Polyethylene, and the

M/G

Unicompartmental Knee with

MIS

Instrumentation. Hip sales increased 17 percent
(increased 17 percent constant currency) to
$441.1 million driven by continued conversion to porous
stems,

Trabecular Metal

acetabular cups, and increased
sales of

Trilogy

Acetabular System cups incorporating

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners.

Longevity

Liner sales comprised 85 percent of
primary hip liner sales in 2002. Trauma product sales increased
4 percent (increased 5 percent constant currency) to
$133.8 million, led by sales of the

Zimmer

Periarticular Plating System. Orthopaedic surgical product
sales increased by 8 percent (increased 9 percent
constant currency) to $176.9 million, led by the continued
growth of the

OrthoPAT

Autotransfusion System.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was
74.9 percent in 2002 compared to 72.7 percent in 2001,
or 73.7 percent excluding separation costs of
$11.9 million. The increase was attributable to increased
average selling prices realized in all segments, the continued
conversion from cemented hip implants to higher margin porous
products, increased penetration of

Longevity

Highly
Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners, higher sales of revision
implants and various manufacturing improvements. The Company
upgraded its automated foundry process for casting knee
femorals, hip stems and cups. An increased number of products
were moved to robotic polishing, as well as, additional porous
knee femorals converted to the fiber metal laser welding
process. Several products previously purchased from outside
suppliers were moved in house for production. Investments in
high speed machining and new tooling technologies made
improvements in reducing both product cycle times and scrap.
Lastly, standardization of the Company’s manufacturing
processes resulted in improvement in efficiency.

Research and development as a percentage of net
sales was 5.9 percent in 2002 compared to 6.1 percent
in 2001 or 5.8 percent excluding separation costs of
$3.2 million. Increases in research and development costs
outpaced sales growth, reflecting investments in active and new
projects, and is consistent with the Company’s stated
target to be at the higher end of the industry average, or
approximately 6 percent of sales. The Company has many
active projects underway focused on areas of strategic
significance, including

MIS

and the establishment of The
Zimmer Institute, innovative materials such as

Trabecular
Metal

and Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene, lifestyle
designs, revision implants and biotechnology.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net sales were 39.8 percent in 2002 compared
to 45.6 percent in 2001, or 40.9 percent excluding
separation costs of $54.9 million. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased 13 percent to
$546.0 million in 2002 from $482.2 million, excluding
separation costs of $54.9 million, in 2001. Excluding
separation costs, the improvement in the expense ratio reflects
lower selling expenses as a result of lower costs associated
with the Company’s U.S. distributor network, sales force
and distributor reorganization in Japan, and improved efficiency
in the utilization of instruments. This was partially offset by
approximately $2 million of consulting costs associated
with tax services and analysis of various external development
opportunities, continued investments in various strategic
initiatives including

MIS,

direct-to-consumer
advertising, training and medical education, and higher
insurance premiums.

Operating profit increased 62 percent in
2002 to $400.9 million from $248.3 million in 2001, or
increased 26 percent from $318.3 million excluding
separation costs of $70.0 million, due to controlled
increases in operating expenses at rates below sales growth.

The effective tax rate on earnings before taxes
decreased to 33.7 percent in 2002 compared to
37.8 percent in 2001, or 35.8 percent excluding
separation costs. The decrease from 35.8 percent to
33.7 percent was due to expanded operations in Puerto Rico,
increased R&D credits, higher foreign tax credits and the
implementation of certain business strategies in 2002 which
resulted in reducing taxes in certain jurisdictions and
increased credits.

Net earnings increased 72 percent to
$257.8 million from $149.8 million in 2001, due to
improved gross profit, lower rate of increase in selling,
general and administrative expenses than sales and the
incurrence of $70.0 million



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2002 FORM 10-K

($49.9 million, net of tax) of separation
costs in 2001. Basic and diluted earnings per share
increased 73 percent and 70 percent to $1.33 and
$1.31, respectively, from $0.77 in 2001.

Year Ended December 31, 2001

Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000

Net sales for the year ended December 31,
2001 increased 13 percent (increased 17 percent
constant currency). Sales growth reflected strong demand for
reconstructive implants and outstanding results in the
Company’s largest operating segment, the Americas. This
increase in the Americas was partially offset by weak local
currencies in Asia Pacific and Europe. This increase was
comprised of a 14 percent increase due to incremental
volume and changes in the mix of product sales, a 3 percent
increase due to higher average selling prices and a
4 percent decrease due to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations.

The introduction of new materials, techniques and
technologies has contributed to a significant increase in demand
for the Company’s products and has generally had a
favorable effect on sales as average selling prices for the new
materials and technologies generally exceed those being
replaced. For example, sales have been favorably affected by a
market shift from cruciate retaining designs to posterior
stabilized designs for total knee procedures. The Company
maintains a relatively strong market position in posterior
stabilized knees. Sales have also benefited from a market shift
from cemented components to higher priced porous components for
total hip replacements. Introduction of the

ZMR

Revision
Hip System provided the Company with a more comprehensive
offering in a market subcategory that is reported to experience
a higher growth rate than primary hip replacements.

Introduction of the

Prolong

Highly
Crosslinked Polyethylene Articular Surface for total knee
replacement procedures exemplifies the Company’s continued
use of innovative materials and technologies and follows the
successful introduction of the

Longevity

Highly
Crosslinked Polyethylene Liner for total hip replacement
procedures. The market acceptance of the

Longevity

Polyethylene Liner, which commands premium prices in most
markets over the standard polyethylene liner, has been rapid.

Net sales in the Americas increased
21 percent to $790.7 million compared to 2000. This
increase was comprised of a 16 percent increase due to
incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales,
together with a 5 percent increase due to higher average
selling prices. Sales of reconstructive implants increased
25 percent with strong sales in all categories. Knee sales
increased 25 percent led by growth in sales of

NexGen
Legacy

Posterior Stabilized Knee, the recently introduced

NexGen Legacy

Posterior Stabilized Flex Knee, as well as
the

M/G

Unicompartmental Knee, now featuring

MIS

instrumentation. Hip sales increased 23 percent, driven
by continued conversion to porous stems, the

ZMR

Modular
Revision Hip System,

Trabecular Metal

acetabular cups,
and increased sales of

Trilogy

Acetabular System cups
incorporating

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene
Liners. Trauma product sales increased 11 percent, in large
part due to the introduction of the new ZPS internal
fixation devices during the fourth quarter and increased sales
in fracture instruments.

Net sales in Asia Pacific decreased
4 percent to $255.2 million compared to 2000. This
decrease was comprised of an 8 percent increase due to
incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales,
which was more than offset by a 12 percent decrease due to
foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Knee sales decreased
6 percent (increased 5 percent constant currency),
reflecting continuing strong sales of

NexGen Legacy

Posterior Stabilized Flex Knee. Hip sales decreased
2 percent (increased 9 percent constant currency)
driven primarily by continued conversion to porous stems,
introduction of the

ZMR

Revision Hip System and sales of

Trilogy

cups incorporating

Longevity

Highly
Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. Trauma products decreased
8 percent (increased 3 percent constant currency) with
higher sales of

M/DN

Intramedullary Fixation nails
offset by weaker sales of compression hip screws.

Net sales in Europe increased 10 percent
(increased 14 percent constant currency) to
$132.7 million compared to 2000. This increase was
comprised of a 13 percent increase due to incremental
volume and changes in the mix of product sales, a 1 percent
increase due to higher average selling prices and a
4 percent decrease due to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. This increase was driven by double-digit growth in
Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Knee sales
increased 13 percent (increased 17 percent constant
currency) driven by strong sales of the

NexGen Legacy

system of knee prostheses as well as

M/G

Unicompartmental Knee with

MIS

instrumentation. Hip
sales increased 11 percent (increased 15 percent
constant currency) supported by the recent introduction of the

ZMR

Revision Hip System and increased sales of

Trilogy

cups incorporating

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked
Polyethylene Liners. Trauma sales decreased 8 percent
(decreased 4 percent constant currency) in comparison to
high-volume tender sales that occurred in the fourth quarter of
2000.

Overall, worldwide reconstructive implant sales
increased 16 percent (increased 19 percent constant
currency) to $886.5 million. Knee sales increased by
16 percent (increased 20 percent constant currency) to
$481.7 million, reflecting continued strong sales of the

NexGen Legacy

Posterior Stabilized Knee and

NexGen
Legacy

Posterior Stabilized Flex Knee, introduced
recently in the Americas. Hip sales increased by 15 percent
(increased 19 percent constant currency) to
$376.6 million, driven by continued conversion to porous
hip stems, strong sales of

Trilogy

cups incorporating

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners and
the continuing introduction of the

ZMR

Revision Hip
System. Trauma product sales increased 4 percent (increased
8 percent constant currency) to $128.3 million, driven
by the introduction of the new ZPS internal fixation devices and
strong sales of

M/DN

nails in Asia Pacific. Orthopaedic



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2002 FORM 10-K

surgical product sales increased 7 percent
(increased 10 percent constant currency) to
$163.8 million, led by the introduction of the

OrthoPAT

Autotransfusion System, that can be used perioperatively.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was
72.7 percent in 2001, or 73.7 percent excluding
separation costs of $11.9 million, compared to
72.1 percent in 2000. This increase was due to higher
average selling prices, favorable premium priced product mix, as
well as improved manufacturing efficiencies associated with
increased sales volume and enhanced productivity. This was
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and inflationary expense increases,
including wages and fringe benefits.

Research and development as a percentage of net
sales was 6.1 percent in 2001, or 5.8 percent
excluding separation costs of $3.2 million, compared to
5.0 percent in 2000. This increase was due to higher
spending on research and development activities focused on
broadening the Company’s product offerings in areas such as
less invasive approaches to orthopaedic procedures,
incorporation of new materials such as

Trabecular Metal

and highly crosslinked polyethylene. Research and
development expenditures, consistent with the Company’s
strategy to offer innovative new products and comprehensive
solutions, increased over 50 percent to $68.4 million,
excluding separation costs, for the 2 year period ended
December 31, 2001.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net sales were 45.6 percent in 2001, or 40.9
percent excluding separation costs of $54.9 million,
compared to 41.3 percent in 2000. In the fourth quarter
2001, the Company recorded a $3.0 million pretax charge for
possible payments of non-reimbursed, direct medical expenses to
patients who chose to revise certain recalled Saint-Gobain
manufactured Zirconia femoral heads. Excluding the costs
of separation and charges related to Saint-Gobain, selling,
general and administrative expenses increased 11 percent
to $474.9 million in 2001 from $429.8 million in
2000. This increase was driven by an increase in selling and
marketing expenses where the Company continued to invest in
selling and marketing programs, including sales force expansion,
support for the U.S. distributor network, target
direct-to-customer advertising and the establishment of the

MIS

business unit. General and administrative expenses,
in dollar terms, remained constant in 2001 compared with 2000,
reflecting strict expense controls across all geographic
regions. Over the four year period ended December 31, 2001,
general and administrative expenses excluding the aforementioned
$3.0 million have remained constant while net sales
increased by over $300 million.

Operating profit decreased 7 percent in 2001
to $248.3 million from $268.0 million in 2000.
Excluding separation costs of $70.0 million, operating
profit increased 19 percent to $318.3 million, due
primarily to the increase in gross profit margin, together with
expense leveraging.

The effective tax rate on earnings before taxes
increased to 37.8 percent in 2001 compared to
34.3 percent in 2000. Excluding separation costs, the
effective tax rate increased to 35.8 percent. The tax
provision prior to August 6, 2001 was computed by the
Company’s former parent. The Company’s tax rate after
August 6, 2001 was 36.1 percent on a pro forma
separate return basis.

Net earnings decreased 15 percent in 2001 to
$149.8 million from $176.0 million in 2000,
principally due to the incurrence of $70.0 million
($49.9 million net of tax) of separation costs related to
the Distribution. The net earnings decrease was partially offset
by improvements in gross profit and lower selling, general and
administrative expenses excluding separation costs. Basic and
diluted earnings per share decreased 15 percent in 2001 to
$0.77 from $0.91 in 2000.

OPERATING PROFIT BY SEGMENT

The following table sets forth the operating
profit by segment for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000:

Operating Profit by Segment

Percent of net sales

Year Ended December 31, 2002

Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Operating profit for the Americas as a percentage
of net sales increased to 46.5 percent in 2002 from
45.1 percent in 2001, reflecting improved gross profit
margins due to higher average selling prices and increased sales
of higher margin products, and lower selling expenses as a
percent of sales due to lower costs associated with the U.S.
distributor network. The Americas continued to invest in
strategic initiatives such as

MIS

, field sales personnel,
medical education programs and new product launches.

Operating profit for Asia Pacific as a percentage
of net sales increased to 43.7 percent in 2002 from
41.1 percent in 2001. This increase reflects lower selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in
Japan as a result of a sales force and distributor
reorganization, partially offset by lower gross profit
margins as a result of lower yen hedge gains compared to 2001.

Operating profit for Europe as a percentage of
net sales increased to 21.0 percent in 2002 from
15.6 percent in 2001, due to improved gross profit margins
as a result of higher average selling prices and favorable
product and country mix, the leveraging of sales growth in
Europe on controlled increases in operating expenses and
improved efficiency in the utilization of instruments.



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2002 FORM 10-K

Year Ended December 31, 2001

Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000

Operating profit for the Americas as a percentage
of net sales decreased to 45.1 percent in 2001 from
47.8 percent in 2000. This decrease reflects higher selling
expenses partially offset by favorable effects of increased
sales of higher margin products and higher average selling
prices.

Operating profit for Asia Pacific as a percentage
of net sales increased to 41.1 percent in 2001 from
38.1 percent in 2000. While revenues were adversely
affected by weak local currencies, the negative impact of
foreign currency on sales was largely mitigated in operating
profit by gains on derivative financial instruments (more fully
described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are included herein under Item 8), asset
management and expense reduction initiatives.

Operating profit for Europe as a percentage of
net sales increased to 15.6 percent in 2001 from
15.3 percent in 2000. The increase in 2001 was due to
favorable country and product mix.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flow generated from operations was
$220.2 million in 2002, compared with $171.8 million
in 2001. The principal source of cash was net earnings of
$257.8 million, non-cash charges for depreciation of
$25.3 million, partially offset by working capital
investments of $62.9 million. In 2001, the Company incurred
$70.0 million ($49.9 million net of tax) for the
separation from its former parent.

Working capital continues to be a key management
focus. The Company strategically invested in inventory and
instruments to support strong sales growth in the Americas and
Europe, and to support new products launched during the year as
well as expected to be launched in 2003. The Company intends to
operate at approximately 250 to 260 days of inventory and
ended 2002 at 247 days. Accounts receivable collection
remained strong, with the Americas at a record 33 days,
4 days favorable to prior year. During the year, the
Company contributed $20.7 million to the U.S. and Puerto
Rico pension plans, representing maximum allowable funding, for
liabilities assumed from its former parent on Distribution, in
addition to liabilities accrued since Distribution. The Company
expects 2003 pension contributions to be lower than the 2002
level.

Cash flow used in investing activities was
$35.7 million in 2002 compared with $54.7 million
in 2001. In 2001, the Company invested in the expansion of its
manufacturing and distribution capacity with an addition to
the Company’s main distribution center in Warsaw,
Indiana, to support sales growth. In 2002, the Company
continued to invest in computer hardware and software for the
new information technology system for the Company’s North
American operations and additional computer system
infrastructure required as a result of the separation.

The Company has a $600 million, committed,
multi-currency, revolving senior unsecured syndicated credit
agreement (the “Credit Facility”) that matures
July 31, 2004. The Credit Facility contains customary
affirmative and negative covenants, including a maximum leverage
ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Company is in
compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility as of
December 31, 2002. Also, the Credit Facility restricts the
payment of dividends and the making of investments if the
Company does not have an investment grade rating, as
defined. The Company’s credit rating as of
December 31, 2002 met such requirement. Available
borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2002,
were $443.8 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility
may bear interest at higher or lower margins above LIBOR, based
on the Company’s senior unsecured long-term debt rating and
the amounts drawn under the Credit Facility.

Cash provided by operating activities, together
with proceeds from issuance of common stock, were used in 2002
to fund payments of debt of $212.8 million. The Company had
$15.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding
borrowings of $156.7 million as of December 31, 2002.
The Company expects to pay off the remaining debt balance by the
end of 2003 with cash provided from operations absent any cash
requirements for acquisitions during the period.
The Company intends to maintain a capital structure that
is consistent with an investment grade credit rating.

Management believes that cash flows from
operations, together with available borrowings under the Credit
Facility, will be sufficient to meet the Company’s working
capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs. Should
investment opportunities arise, the Company believes that its
earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow the Company to
obtain additional capital, if necessary. The ability to issue
additional equity is subject to limitations in order to preserve

agreement with its former parent, the Company is required
to indemnify the former parent for the amount of any tax
imposed under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code.

SEPARATION FROM BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB

The Company was incorporated in Delaware as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb on
January 12, 2001. On July 25, 2001, Bristol-Myers
Squibb transferred the assets and liabilities of its orthopaedic
business to the Company. On August 6, 2001, Bristol-Myers
Squibb distributed all of the shares of Company common stock to
Bristol-Myers Squibb stockholders in the form of a dividend of
one share of Company common stock, and the associated preferred
stock purchase right, for every 10 shares of Bristol-Myers
Squibb common stock. In addition, the Company assumed all
obligations under a $600 million credit facility
(“Credit Facility”) established by the Company and its
former parent with then outstanding borrowings of
$290 million. With additional borrowings under the Credit
Facility, the Company repaid amounts due to its former parent of
approximately $90 million, and finally, the Company assumed
an additional $22 million of borrowings under the Credit
Facility for separation costs. In addition, the Company
recognized certain liabilities and obligations for pension,
post-retirement, long-term disability and U.S. sales agent
benefits. Recognition of these liabilities and obligations and
other adjustments were reflected in the remaining net investment
in the Company by its former parent of $14.1 million as of
the Distribution and subsequently reclassified to opening
retained earnings. The Distribution qualified as a tax-free
transaction under Section 355 and 368 (a) (1) (1) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as more fully described in
Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are
included herein under Item 8.

The Company incurred $70.0 million
($49.9 million net of taxes) in costs, fees and expenses
relating to the separation from Bristol-Myers Squibb and the
related distribution of Company common stock to Bristol-Myers
Squibb stockholders which was partially funded by additional
borrowings under the credit facility. The costs, fees and
expenses were primarily for retention bonuses, legal separation
matters, professional expenses and costs of producing, printing,
mailing and distributing the information statement relating to
the Distribution.

Except for separation costs and the ongoing
interest cost associated with debt assumed or incurred as of the
Distribution, the Company does not currently anticipate that
operating costs resulting from the separation from its former
parent will materially impact its cost structure as reflected in
its historical consolidated results.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
    Market Risk

MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to certain market risks as
part of its ongoing business operations, including risks from
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices, that could impact its financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its
exposure to these and other market risks through regular
operating and financing activities, and on a limited basis,
through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative
financial instruments are used solely as risk management tools
and not for speculative investment purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

The Company operates on a global basis and is
exposed to the risk that its financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes
in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is primarily
exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to
its transactions and net assets denominated in Japanese Yen and
the Euro. The Company manages the foreign currency exposure
centrally, on a combined basis, which allows the Company to net
exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets. In order
to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on
transactions denominated in foreign currencies, the Company
enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of
foreign exchange forward contracts with major international
financial institutions. These forward contracts are designed to
hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily
intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods
consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and
losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are
temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then
recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings.

The notional amounts of outstanding foreign
exchange forward and option contracts, principally Japanese Yen
and the Euro, entered into with third parties, at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, were $252 million and
$82 million, respectively. For all contracts outstanding at
December 31, 2002: the Company has obligation to purchase
U.S. Dollars and sell Japanese Yen and the Euro at set maturity
dates ranging from January 2003 through
September 2004. The weighted average contract rates for
2003 and 2004 are 129 and 117 Yen and $0.97 and $1.03 Euro,
respectively.

The Company maintains written policies and
procedures governing its risk management activities. The
Company’s policy requires that critical terms of hedging
instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On
this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash
flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected
to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge
instruments. As part of its risk management program, the Company
furthermore performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential
changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial
position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange
rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of
foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at
December 31, 2002, indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar
uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the
Japanese Yen and the Euro, with no change in the interest
differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase
or decrease earnings before income taxes, depending on the
direction of the change, by an average approximate amount of
$17.1 million and $9.9 million for the Yen and Euro
contracts, respectively. Any change in the fair value of foreign
exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a
currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a
change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently,
foreign exchange contracts would not subject the Company to
material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and
losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets,
liabilities, and transactions being hedged.

The Company had net investment exposures to net
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of
approximately $135 million and $87 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, primarily in the
Japanese Yen and the Euro.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

The Company purchases raw material commodities
such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, medical grade polymer
and sterile packaging. The Company enters into 12 to
24 month supply contracts on these commodities to alleviate
the impact of market fluctuation in prices. As part of the
Company’s risk management program, sensitivity analyses
related to potential commodity price changes are performed. A
10 percent price change across all these commodities would
not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

INTEREST RATE RISK

In the normal course of business, the Company is
exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could
impact its results of operations and financial condition. The
Company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its
regular operations and financing activities.

Presently, the Company invests its cash and cash
equivalents in money market and investment-grade short-term debt
instruments. The primary investment objective is to ensure
capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting
default and market risk. Currently, the Company does not use
derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio.

The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk
arises principally from the variable rates associated with its
credit



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2002 FORM 10-K

facilities. The Company is subject to movements
in interest rate risk on the committed Credit Facility and its
uncommitted credit facilities. Presently, all of its debt
outstanding is floating. The Company currently does not hedge
its interest rate exposure, but may do so in the future. Based
upon the Company’s overall interest rate exposure as of
December 31, 2002, a change of 10% in interest rates would
not have a material effect on the Company’s earnings or
cash flows over a one-year period. However, due to the
uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their
possible effects, this analysis assumes no such action, nor
management actions to mitigate interest rate changes. Further,
this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the
level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment. Presently, the Company intends to utilize cash flow
to reduce outstanding borrowings.

CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments, which potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily
cash, cash equivalents, counterparty transactions, and accounts
receivable.

The Company places its investments in highly
rated financial institutions and money market instruments, and
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. The
Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit
risk on its cash and cash equivalents and investments.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by the financial institutions with which
it conducts business. However, this loss is limited to the
amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to
the financial instrument contract exceed the obligation of the
Company. The Company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by
dealing with a diversified group of major financial
institutions. Credit risk is managed through the monitoring of
counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard
credit guidelines. The Company does not anticipate any
nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to
trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of
customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic
areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the
customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of
business. However, essentially all of the Company’s trade
receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital
and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with
distributors who operate in international markets and,
accordingly, are exposed to their respective business, economic
and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent upon the
financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective
countries’ national economic and health care systems.
Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals,
credit limits and monitoring procedures and the Company believes
that reserves for losses are adequate. There is no significant
net exposure due to any individual customer or other major
concentration of credit risk.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
Presentation

– The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company after elimination of all significant intercompany
accounts and transactions. The consolidated financial statements
represent the Company’s operations as a public company
commencing on August 6, 2001, combined with the operations
of Zimmer as a division of its former parent prior to
becoming a public company. For periods prior to August 6,
2001, intercompany accounts with its former parent, other than
specific outstanding obligations, were combined with invested
capital and reported in the consolidated financial statements as
net investment by former parent. Certain amounts in the 2001 and
2000 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the 2002 presentation.

Use of
Estimates

– The consolidated
financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and,
accordingly, include amounts that are based on management’s
best estimates and judgments. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Foreign Currency
Translation

– The financial
statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for
assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for operating
results. Unrealized translation gains and losses are included
in accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses included in net earnings are not material.

Revenue
Recognition

– A significant
portion of the Company’s revenue is recognized for field
based product upon notification that the product has been
implanted or used. For all other transactions, the Company
recognizes revenue when title is passed to customers, generally
upon shipment. Estimated returns and allowances are recorded as
a reduction of sales when the revenue is recognized. The
reserves for doubtful accounts were $7.2 million and
$6.5 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Cash and
Equivalents

– The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company currently does not have any investments which would not
be considered cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in
the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents are valued at
cost, which approximates their fair value.

Inventories

–
Inventories, net of allowances for obsolete and slow-moving
goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
determined on the basis of average costing.

Prepaid
Expenses

– Prepaid expenses
include the cost of instruments in stock for surgical procedures
consigned for use in connection with implantation of the
Company’s products. These costs are recognized in selling,
general and administrative expense in the year in which the
instruments are placed into service.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

– Property, plant
and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed based on the estimated useful lives of
ten to forty years for buildings and improvements and 3 to
8 years for machinery and equipment using the straight-line
method. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the Company
reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss
would be recognized when estimated future cash flows relating to
the asset are less than its carrying amount.

Research and
Development

– The Company
expenses all research and development costs as incurred.
Research and development costs include salaries, prototypes,
depreciation of equipment used in research and development,
consultant fees and amounts paid to collaborative partners.

Income
Taxes

– The Company accounts
for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates in
effect for the years in which the differences are expected to
reverse. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the
income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted
to the U.S.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

– The Company
accounts for all derivative financial instruments in accordance
with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” which requires that
all derivative instruments be required as assets or liabilities
on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. The Company
maintains written policies and procedures that permit, under
appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization,
the



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2002 FORM 10-K

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(continued)

use of derivative financial instruments solely
for hedging purposes. The use of derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes is prohibited.
The Company utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to
offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on anticipated
foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany sales and
purchases expected to occur within the next twelve to
twenty-four months. Derivative instruments that qualify as cash
flow hedges are designated as such from inception. Formal
documentation is maintained of the Company’s objectives,
the nature of the risk being hedged, identification of the
instrument, the hedged transaction, the hedging relationship and
how effectiveness of the hedging instrument will be assessed.
The Company’s policy requires that critical terms of a
hedging instrument are essentially the same as a hedged
forecasted transaction. On this basis, with respect to a cash
flow hedge, changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged
transaction are generally expected to be completely offset by
the cash flows attributable to hedge instruments. The Company,
therefore, performs quarterly assessments of hedge effectiveness
by verifying and documenting that critical terms of the hedge
instrument and forecasted transactions have not changed. The
Company also assesses on a quarterly basis whether there have
been adverse developments regarding the risk of a counterparty
default. For derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash
flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is
temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then
recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net
earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change
in fair value, if any, is reported in net earnings.

Stock
Compensation

– At
December 31, 2002, the Company has three stock-based
employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note 10. The Company accounts for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related Interpretations. No stock based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all
options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to
the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income
and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation,” to the above plans.

Comprehensive
Income

– Other comprehensive
income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are included in
comprehensive income but are excluded from net earnings
as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to
stockholders’ equity. The Company’s other
comprehensive income is comprised of unrealized foreign currency
hedge gains and losses, net of tax, minimum pension liability
adjustments, net of tax, and foreign currency translation
adjustments.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive
income at December 31, 2002 and 2001, are as follows (in
millions):

Accounting
Pronouncements

– Effective
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
and SFAS No. 144 without any material impact on its
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.” SFAS No. 143 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 applies to legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
that result from the acquisition, construction, development and
(or) the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for
certain obligations of lessees. SFAS No. 143 is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2002. This pronouncement is not expected to have a
material effect on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 146 addresses the
financial accounting and reporting for exit and disposal
activities and certain costs associated with those activities.
SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity, other than certain
one-time termination benefits, be measured initially at its fair
value and recognized in the period in which the liability is
incurred. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or



ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2002 FORM 10-K

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(continued)

disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002. This pronouncement is not expected to
have a material effect on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

On December 31, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” SFAS
No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” to provide alternative methods
of transition to the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends
the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and APB Opinion
No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to require
disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies
of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with
respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net
earnings and earnings per share in annual and interim financial
statements. While SFAS No. 148 does not amend SFAS
No. 123 to require companies to account for employee stock
options using the fair value method, the disclosure provisions
of SFAS No. 148 are applicable to all companies with
stock-based employee compensation, regardless of whether they
account for that compensation using the fair value method of
SFAS No. 123 or the intrinsic value method of APB Opinion
No. 25. The Company adopted SFAS No. 148 on
December 31, 2002.

DEBT

Credit Facility

The Company has a $600 million
multi-currency, revolving senior unsecured syndicated Credit
Facility that matures on July 31, 2004. Borrowings under
the Credit Facility may bear interest at the appropriate LIBOR
rate, depending upon the currency denomination of the borrowing,
or an alternative base rate, in each case, an applicable margin
determined by reference to the Company’s senior unsecured
long-term debt rating and the amounts drawn under the Credit
Facility.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had
$156.7 million in outstanding borrowings, including $156.2
under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2002, the
Credit Facility borrowings were comprised of $82 million in
U.S. dollar based borrowings with a weighted average interest
rate of 3.42 percent (4.35 percent as of
December 31, 2001) and the equivalent of $74.2 million
in Japanese Yen based borrowings with a weighted average
interest rate of 0.93 percent (1.17 percent as of
December 31, 2001). The borrowings under the Credit
Facility have been classified as short term based on the
Company’s expectation it will be repaid by the end of 2003.

The Credit Facility is to be used for general
corporate purposes. The Credit Facility also allows for the
issuance of letters of credit.

The Credit Facility contains customary
affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for an
unsecured financing arrangement, none of which are considered
restrictive to the operation of the business. Financial
covenants include a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum
interest coverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31,
2002. Also, the Credit Facility restricts the payment of
dividends and the making of investments if the Company does not
have an investment grade rating, as defined. The Company’s

rating as of December 31, 2002 met such
requirement. Commitments under the Credit Facility are subject
to certain fees, including a facility and a utilization fee.

Uncommitted Credit Facilities

The Company has a $26 million uncommitted
unsecured revolving line of credit. The purpose of this credit
line is to support the working capital needs, letters of credit
and overdraft needs for the Company. The uncommitted credit
agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants
and events of default, none of which are considered restrictive
to the operation of the business. In addition, this uncommitted
credit agreement provides for unconditional and irrevocable
guarantees by the Company. In the event the Company’s
long-term debt ratings by both Standard and Poor’s Ratings
Services and Moody’s Investor’s Service, Inc., fall
below BB- and Ba3, then the Company may be required
to repay all outstanding and contingent obligations. The
Company’s credit rating as of December 31, 2002 met
such requirement. This uncommitted credit line matures on
July 31, 2003. Outstanding borrowings under this
uncommitted line of credit as of December 31, 2002 were
$0.5 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.35%.

The Company also has a $15 million
uncommitted revolving unsecured line of credit. The purpose of
this line of credit is to support short-term working capital
needs of the Company. The agreement for this uncommitted
unsecured line of credit contains customary covenants, none of
which are considered restrictive to the operation of the
business. This uncommitted line matures on July 31, 2003.
There were no borrowings under this uncommitted line of credit
as of December 31, 2002.

The Company has a $20 million uncommitted
revolving unsecured line of credit. The purpose of this line of
credit is to support short-term working capital needs of the
Company. The pricing is based upon money market rates. The
agreement for this uncommitted unsecured line of credit contains
customary covenants, none of which are considered restrictive to
the operation of the business. This uncommitted line matures on
July 31, 2003. There were no borrowings under this
uncommitted line of credit as of December 31, 2002.

The Company was in compliance with all covenants
under all three of the uncommitted credit facilities as of
December 31, 2002. The Company had no long-term debt
as of December 31, 2002.

Outstanding debt as of December 31, 2002 and
2001, consist of the following (in millions):

The Company paid $13.0 million and
$4.6 million in interest charges during 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Fair Value

The carrying value of the Company’s
borrowings approximates fair value due to their short-term
maturities and variable interest rates.

8.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to market risk due to
changes in currency exchange rates. As a result, the Company
utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effect
of exchange rate fluctuations on anticipated foreign currency
transactions, primarily intercompany sales and purchases
expected to occur within the next twelve to twenty-four months.
The Company does not hold financial instruments for trading
or speculative purposes. For derivatives which qualify as
hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion
of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other
comprehensive income, then recognized in earnings when
the hedged item affects earnings. The ineffective portion
of a derivative’s change in fair value, if any, is
reported in earnings. The net amount recognized in earnings
during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, due to
ineffectiveness and amounts excluded from the assessment of
hedge effectiveness, was not significant.

The notional amounts of outstanding foreign
exchange forward contracts, principally Japanese Yen and the
Euro, entered into with third parties, at December 31,
2002, was $252 million. The fair value of derivative
instruments recorded in accrued liabilities at December 31,
2002, was $13.8 million, or $8.5 million net of taxes,
which is deferred in other comprehensive income and is expected
to be reclassified to earnings over the next two years, of
which, $7.7 million, or $4.8 million, net of taxes, is
expected to be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve
months.

9.

CAPITAL STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

As discussed in Note 14, all of the shares
of Company common stock were distributed at the Distribution by
the former parent to its stockholders in the form of a dividend
of one share of Company common stock, and the associated
preferred stock purchase right, for every ten shares of common
stock of the former parent. In July 2001 the board
of directors of the Company adopted a rights agreement
intended to have anti-takeover effects. Under this agreement one
right attaches to each share of Company common stock. The rights
will not become exercisable until the earlier of: a) the
Company learns that a person or group acquired, or obtained the
right to acquire, beneficial ownership of securities
representing more than 20 percent of the shares of Company
common stock then outstanding, or b) such date, if any, as
may be designated by the board of directors following the
commencement of, or first public disclosure of an intention
to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer

(continued)

for shares of Company common stock then
outstanding that could result in a person or group
acquiring, or obtaining the right to acquire, beneficial
ownership of securities representing more than 20 percent
of Company common stock then outstanding.

The board of directors authorized for issuance
2 million shares of a series of preferred stock of the
Company designated as Series A Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) in
connection with the adoption of the rights agreement. Shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock are only issuable upon the
exercise of the rights. No shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock have been issued as of December 31, 2002.

The board of directors may redeem all of the
rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per right. If
not previously exercised or redeemed, the rights will
expire 10 years from the date that the rights agreement
commenced.

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings
per share is net earnings available to common stockholders. The
denominator for basic earnings per share is the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. The
denominator for diluted earnings per share is weighted average
shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive
stock options. The following is a reconciliation of weighted
average shares for the basic and diluted share computations (in
millions):

For periods prior to the Distribution, basic and
diluted shares outstanding are assumed to be equivalent to the
number of shares of Company common stock outstanding immediately
following the Distribution.

10.

STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had
three stock option plans in effect, the 2001 Stock Incentive
Plan, the TeamShare Stock Option Plan and the Stock Plan for
Non-Employee Directors. The Company has reserved the maximum
number of shares of common stock available for award under the
terms of each of these plans and has registered
34.3 million shares of common stock. Options may be granted
under these plans at a price of not less than the fair market
value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. The 2001
Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified
stock options and incentive stock options, long-term performance
awards, restricted stock awards and deferred stock units.
Options granted under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan may include
stock appreciation rights. The TeamShare Stock Option Plan
provides for the grant of non-qualified stock option and stock
appreciation rights while the Stock Plan for Non-Employee
Directors provides for awards of stock options, restricted
stock and restricted stock units to non-employee directors.

Options granted under these plans generally vest
over three to five years, although in no event in less than one
year, and expire ten years from the date of grant. Certain
options have price thresholds, which affect exercisability.

Under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, the total
number of awards which may be granted in a given year
pursuant to options and other awards under the plan may not
exceed 1.9 percent of the outstanding shares of the
Company’s stock on the effective date of the Plan for 2001
or January 1 of each subsequent year, plus the number of
shares from the prior year that were available for grant but not
granted, that were granted but subsequently terminated, expired,
cancelled or surrendered without being exercised or tendered in
the prior year to pay for options or satisfy tax withholding
requirements. No participant may receive options or awards which
in the aggregate exceed 2 million shares of stock over the
life of the Plan.

At the Distribution, certain options to purchase
Bristol-Myers Squibb stock that were held by Company employees
were converted to Company stock options under either the 2001
Stock Incentive Plan or the TeamShare Stock Option Plan. The
options were converted at quantities and exercise prices that
maintained the intrinsic value of the option as it existed
immediately prior to the Distribution. The vesting dates and
exercise periods of the options were not affected by the
conversion.

A summary of the status of all options granted to
employees and non-employee directors at December 31 and
changes during the period from the distribution date is
presented below:

(continued)

The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding at December 31, 2002:

Options exercisable at December 31, 2002 and
2001, were 4.7 million and 4.0 million, respectively,
with average exercise prices of $22.81 and $19.15, respectively.

The fair value of each option granted is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

The above assumptions for 2002 and 2001 pertain
to the Company, while 2000 assumptions are associated with the
Company’s former parent.

The weighted average fair value for options
granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $10.63, $14.10 and
$16.34, respectively.

See Note 2 for the effect on net earnings
and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock based
employee compensation.

Restricted Stock

At the Distribution, certain members of
management had restricted stock grants for Bristol-Myers Squibb
stock which were converted into Company restricted stock grants
at quantities and prices that maintained the intrinsic value
that existed immediately prior to the Distribution. Total
converted grants represented 106,560 shares at the
Distribution. Subsequent to the Distribution, restrictions on
32,578 and 20,361 shares were eliminated in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. In addition, restricted stock grants were made for
50,200 and 33,681 shares in 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The awards are being expensed over the vesting period of five
years from date of grant and the expense recorded by the Company
for all periods presented was not significant.

11.

RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has defined benefit pension plans
covering substantially all U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. Plan
benefits are primarily based on years of credited service and
the participant’s compensation. In addition to the U.S. and
Puerto Rico defined benefit pension plans, the Company sponsors
various non-U.S. pension arrangements, including retirement and
termination benefit plans required by local law or coordinated
with government sponsored plans.

The Company also provides comprehensive medical
and group life insurance benefits to substantially all U.S. and
Puerto Rico retirees who elect to participate in the
Company’s comprehensive medical and group life plans. The
medical plan is contributory, and the life insurance plan is
non-contributory. No similar plans exist for employees outside
the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

In both the U.S. and jurisdictions outside of the
U.S., the Company has adopted employee benefit plans that
are comparable to those of its former parent. In general, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, eligibility
for benefits, benefit forms and vesting under Company
plans, each active employee is credited with his or her service
with the former parent to the extent the corresponding plans of
the former parent gave credit for such service.

In connection with the Distribution, the Company
and its former parent entered into an Employee Benefits
Agreement which allocated responsibilities relating to employee
compensation, benefit plans and programs and other related
matters. Under the agreement, as of a specified date, active
employees of the Company ceased to be active participants in
benefit plans maintained by the former parent and became
eligible to participate in all applicable Company plans.

The agreement provides that, as of the
Distribution, the Company assumed, retained and is liable
for all wages, salaries, welfare, incentive compensation and
other employee-related obligations and liabilities for all
current and former employees of the Company, except as
specifically provided otherwise. The former parent retained
certain obligations for domestic pension benefits for services
rendered through the Distribution. The former parent also
retained obligations for medical and group life insurance
benefits for all domestic retirees and those employees eligible
to retire as of the Distribution. Substantially all assets
funding its pension and postretirement benefit plans were
retained by the former parent.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the
Company’s U.S. and Puerto Rico pension plans with
accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$38.9 million, $21.5 million and $20.5 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2002 and
$25.5 million, $8.8 million and $2.2 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2001.

The components of net periodic expense as of
December 31 for the Company’s postretirement benefit
plans subsequent to the Distribution are as follows
(in millions):

The weighted average actuarial assumptions used
in accounting for the Company’s postretirement benefit
plans were as follows:

Changes in benefit obligations and plan assets,
from the Distribution to December 31, 2002 for the
Company’s postretirement benefit plans, were
(in millions):

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
Company has no assets in its postretirement benefit plans.

A one percentage point change in the assumed
health care cost trend rates would have no significant effect on
the service and interest cost components of net postretirement
benefit expense and the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation. The effect of a change in the healthcare cost trend
rate is tempered by a cap that limits medical costs to be paid
by the Company.

Included in the consolidated statement of
earnings are allocations from the Company’s former parent
for expenses specifically attributable to the Company’s
employees’ participation in its retirement and
postretirement benefit plans for periods prior to the
Distribution. Amounts included were $6.0 million and
$10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

The Company also sponsors defined contribution
plans for substantially all of the U.S. and Puerto Rico
employees. The principal defined contribution plan is the Zimmer
Holdings, Inc. Savings and Investment Program. The
Company’s contribution under this plan is based on employee
contributions and the level of company match. The Company
recognized $3.5 million, $3.0 million and
$3.0 million of expense for the savings and investment
program for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

12.

INCOME TAXES

The components of earnings before taxes consist
of the following (in millions):

The provision for income taxes consists of
(in millions):

For periods prior to the Distribution, the income
tax provision was calculated on a separate return basis while
actual tax payments were made on a combined return basis by the
Company’s former parent. Income taxes paid by the Company
during 2002 and 2001 (for the period after the Distribution)
were $114.2 million and $43.4 million, respectively.

A reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax
rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. The components of deferred income
taxes consisted of the following (in millions):

The Company’s former parent received a
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), that
the Distribution would qualify as a tax-free transaction. Such a
ruling, while generally binding upon the IRS, is subject to
certain factual representations and assumptions. The Company has
agreed to certain restrictions on its future actions to provide
further assurances that the Distribution will qualify as
tax-free. If the Company fails to abide by such restrictions
and, as a result, the Distribution fails to qualify as a
tax-free transaction, the Company will be obligated to indemnify
its former parent for any resulting tax liability.

Under the Tax Sharing Agreement (the
“Agreement”) executed in conjunction with the
Distribution, the Company’s former parent retains control
and discretion with regard to any federal, foreign, combined,
consolidated and certain separate state tax filings or tax
audits for periods through the Distribution and retains all
refunds for such periods. The Agreement was amended to clarify
the Company is responsible for 25 percent of tax audit
assessments in foreign jurisdictions for periods prior to the
Distribution up to a cumulative maximum of $5 million.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had an
aggregate of $53.7 million of unremitted earnings of
foreign subsidiaries that have been, or are intended to be,
permanently reinvested for continued use in foreign operations.
If the total undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were
remitted, a significant amount of the additional tax would be
offset by the allowable foreign tax credits.

13.

SEGMENT DATA

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and
markets orthopaedic reconstructive implants, trauma products and
orthopaedic surgical products which include surgical supplies
and equipment designed to aid in orthopaedic procedures and to
accommodate patient rehabilitation needs post surgery.
Operations are managed through three major geographic
areas – the Americas, which is comprised principally
of the United States and includes other North, Central and South
American markets; Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of
Japan and includes other Asian and Pacific markets; and Europe,
which is comprised principally of the major countries of Europe
as well as the Middle East and Africa. This structure is the
basis for the Company’s reportable segment information
discussed below. Segment performance is evaluated based on sales
and segment operating profit, exclusive of separation costs and
operating expenses pertaining to global operations and corporate
expenses. Included in segment operating profit is a cost of
capital charge which is offset in global operations. Global
operations include U.S. based research, development engineering,
brand management, corporate legal, finance, human resource
functions, and operations and logistics.

SEPARATION FROM BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY

The Company was incorporated in Delaware as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb, its former
parent, on January 12, 2001. On July 25, 2001,
Bristol-Myers Squibb transferred the assets and liabilities of
its orthopaedic business to the Company. On August 6, 2001,
Bristol-Myers Squibb distributed all of the shares of Company
common stock to Bristol-Myers Squibb stockholders in the form of
a dividend of one share of Company common stock and the
associated preferred stock purchase right, for every 10 shares
of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock. The Distribution qualified
as a tax-free distribution made under Section 355 and
368(a)(1)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as more
fully-described in Note 12. On August 6, 2001, the Company
assumed all obligations under the Credit Facility established by
the Company and its former parent with then outstanding
borrowings of $290 million. With additional borrowings
under the Credit Facility, the Company repaid amounts due to its
former parent of approximately $90 million, and finally,
the Company assumed an additional $22 million of borrowings
under the Credit Facility for separation costs. The Company also
recognized certain liabilities and obligations for pension,
post-retirement, long-term disability and U.S. sales agent
benefits. Recognition of these liabilities and obligations
reduced the net investment in Zimmer by its former parent.

The Company incurred $70.0 million
($49.9 million net of taxes) in costs, fees and expenses
relating to the separation from its former parent and
distribution of Company common stock to the Bristol-Myers Squibb
stockholders. These costs, fees and expenses were primarily for
retention bonuses; legal separation matters; professional
expenses; and costs of producing, printing, mailing and
distributing the information statement related to the
Distribution.

15.

TRANSACTIONS WITH FORMER PARENT

Prior to the Distribution, the former parent of
the Company provided certain services, including administration
of treasury, insurance, payroll, employee compensation and
benefits, travel and meeting services, public and investor
relations, real estate services, internal audit, corporate
aviation and related services, telecommunications, computing
services, corporate income tax and selected legal services.
Management of the Company believes that the methods used to
allocate expenses to the Company for these services were
reasonable, although it cannot be assured that all the expenses
that would have been incurred had the Company been a separate,
standalone entity have been reflected in financial results prior
to the Distribution. These services accounted for a total
expense of $17.2 million for the period January 1,
2001 through the Distribution, and $29.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000.

The Company and its former parent entered into an
Interim Services Agreement pursuant to which the former parent
provided the Company, on an interim, transitional basis, various
services, including, but not limited to, employee benefits
administration and information technology services. The agreed
upon charges for such services were intended to allow the former
parent to recover fully the allocated costs of providing
the services. The Interim Services Agreement expired on
December 31, 2002, except with respect to information
technology services, which will remain in effect until the
Company completes the transition to an alternative service
provider, expected by mid year 2003.

LEASES

Future minimum rental commitments under
non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of
December 31, 2002 were $8.3 million for 2003,
$7.0 million for 2004, $5.7 million for 2005,
$4.4 million for 2006, $2.9 million for 2007 and
$8.6 million thereafter. Total rent expense for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 aggregated
$9.1 million, $5.7 million and $6.0 million,
respectively.

17.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company is subject to product liability and
other claims arising in the ordinary course of business, for
which the Company maintains insurance, subject to self-insured
retention limits. The Company establishes accruals for product
liability and other claims in conjunction with outside counsel
based on current information and historical settlement
information for open claims, related fees and for claims
incurred but not reported. While it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the opinion of
management that these cases will not have a material adverse
effect on the consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.

In addition to product liability, the Company is
subject to other lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary
course of business, none of which are expected to have, upon
ultimate resolution, a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
