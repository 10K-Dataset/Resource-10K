ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

Part I

ITEM 1.

Business

GENERAL

Zimmer Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, is a global leader in the design, development,
manufacture and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic
implants, including joint and dental, spinal implants, and
trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical products. The
Company is headquartered in Warsaw, Indiana. Unless the
context requires otherwise, the term “Zimmer” and
“Company” refer to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and all
of its subsidiaries.

On October 2, 2003, the Company announced
the closing of its exchange offer for Centerpulse AG
(“Centerpulse”), a leading global orthopaedic medical
device company headquartered in Switzerland that services the
reconstructive joint, spine and dental implant markets. The
Centerpulse acquisition provided the Company with a leading
position in the European orthopaedic reconstructive implant
market and a platform in the fast growing spinal market.

The aggregate consideration paid by the Company
for Centerpulse and InCentive Capital AG, a company that
beneficially owned 18.3 percent of the issued Centerpulse
shares (“InCentive”), excluding direct acquisition
costs, was approximately $3.4 billion, consisting of
approximately 44.5 million shares of Company common stock
(valued at approximately $2.2 billion) and approximately
$1.2 billion in cash. The Company used its
$1.75 billion senior credit facility to finance the cash
component.

On March 2, 2004, the Company entered into
an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Merger Agreement”) relating to the acquisition of
Implex Corp. (“Implex”). Pursuant to the terms of the
Merger Agreement, the shareholders of Implex will receive an
initial cash payment and deferred, contingent earn-out payments,
also payable in cash. In 2000, the Company entered into an
exclusive, worldwide strategic alliance for commercialization of
Implex’s innovative

Hedrocel®


biomaterial, which the Company has marketed as

Trabecular
Metal

™ Technology. The proposed merger is an
anticipated outcome of the Company’s alliance relationship
with Implex. The acquisition is expected to close in April of
2004.

Zimmer was incorporated on January 12, 2001
as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
(“Bristol-Myers”). Zimmer, Inc., a predecessor
founded in 1927, was acquired by Bristol-Myers in 1972 and along
with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and certain other of
Bristol-Myers’ operations comprised the orthopaedics
business of Bristol-Myers. On August 6, 2001, the Company
was spun off from Bristol-Myers and became an independent public
company.

CUSTOMERS, SALES AND MARKETING

The Company’s primary customers include
musculoskeletal surgeons, neuro-surgeons, oral surgeons,
dentists, hospitals, distributors, healthcare dealers and, in
their capacity as agents, healthcare purchasing organizations or
buying groups. These customers range from large multinational
enterprises to independent surgeons. A majority of hospitals in
the United States belong to at least one group purchasing
organization. In 2003, individual hospital orders purchased
through contractual arrangements with such purchasing
organizations or buying groups accounted for approximately
45 percent of the Company’s net sales, excluding
Centerpulse, in the United States. Contractual sales were
highest through Novation, LLC (“Novation”), Premier
Purchasing Partners, L.P. (“Premier”), and Health
Trust Purchasing Group, representing 15 percent,
13 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of net sales,
excluding Centerpulse, in the United States. No individual
end-user, however, accounted for over 1 percent of the
Company’s net sales and the top ten end-users accounted for
approximately 5 percent of the Company’s aggregate net
sales in the United States. Historically, annual variations in
contractual purchases by individual end-users affiliated with
buying groups have equaled in the aggregate, and the Company
expects will continue to equal in the aggregate, no more than 15
to 20 percent per buying group. Please see the

“Americas”

below for more detail regarding the
Company’s contractual arrangements with buying groups.

After the acquisition of Centerpulse, the Company
now has operations in more than 24 countries and markets
products in more than 80 countries, with corporate
headquarters in Warsaw, Indiana, and manufacturing, distribution
and warehousing and/or office facilities in more than
60 locations worldwide. The Company manages its operations
through three major geographic segments – the
Americas, which is comprised principally of the United States
and includes other North, Central and South American markets;
Europe, which is comprised principally of Europe and includes
the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised
primarily of Japan and includes other Asian and Pacific markets.
Information about geographic segments can be found in
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are
included herein under Item 8.

The Company sells product through two principal
channels: 1) direct to health care institutions, such as
hospitals, which is referred to as a direct channel account, and
2) through stocking distributors and, in the Asia Pacific
region, healthcare dealers. Through the direct channel accounts,
inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers so
that products are available when needed for surgical procedures.
With the sales to stocking distributors and healthcare dealers,
title to product passes generally upon


Trademark
of Implex Corp.


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

shipment. Products are marketed and sold to all
types of Company customers via both direct channel accounts and
stocking distributors and healthcare dealers. No individual
direct channel account or stocking distributor or healthcare
dealer accounted for more than 10 percent of the
Company’s net revenues for 2003.

The Company carries inventory in warehouse
facilities and retains title to consigned inventory in
sufficient quantities so that products are available when needed
for surgical procedures. Safety stock levels are determined
based on a number of factors including demand, manufacturing
lead times and optimal quantities required to maintain the
highest possible service levels. The Company also carries trade
accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are
generally consistent with local market practices.

The Company utilizes more than 2,000 sales
associates, sales managers and support personnel, some of whom
are employed by independent distributors and sales agencies. The
Company invests a significant amount of time and expense in
providing training in such areas as product features and
benefits, how to use specific products and how to best inform
surgeons of such features and uses. The presence of sales
representatives is deemed by surgeons and hospitals to be
desirable in a high number of procedures and the extensive sales
training provided by the Company enables representatives, when
requested, to be a useful and valuable resource for surgeons
during surgeries. Sales force representatives rely heavily on
strong technical selling skills, medical education and the
ability to provide staff technical support for surgeons.

In response to the different healthcare systems
throughout the world, the Company’s sales and marketing
strategies and organizational structures differ by region. The
Company has, however, carefully integrated a global approach to
sales force training, marketing and medical education into each
locality to provide consistent, high quality service.
Additionally, the Company keeps current with key surgical
developments and other issues related to musculoskeletal
surgeons and the medical procedures they perform, in part
through sponsorship of medical education events. In 2003, the
Company sponsored more than 500 medical education events
and meetings with and among musculoskeletal surgeons around the
world.

Americas.

The
Americas is the largest geographic segment, accounting for
63.6 percent of 2003 net sales, with the United States
accounting for $1,152 million of sales in this region. The
United States sales force consists of independent sales agents,
together with sales associates, sales managers and sales support
personnel, the majority of which sell Company products
exclusively for orthopaedics. The sales force in the spinal area
is generally permitted to sell other non-competitive products.
Sales agents in the United States receive a commission on
product sales and are responsible for many operating decisions
and costs. Sales commissions are accrued at the time of sale.

In this region, the Company has also concentrated
on negotiating contracts with buying groups and managed care
accounts and has increased unit growth by linking the level of
discount received to volume of purchases by customer health care
institutions within a specified group. At negotiated thresholds
within a contract buying period, price discounts increase. For
these buying groups and managed care accounts, the Company
tracks sales volume by contract and as contractual volume
thresholds are achieved, the higher discounts are applied at an
item level on customer invoices. Under these buying contracts,
the Company is generally designated as one of several identified
preferred purchasing sources for the members of the buying group
for specified products, although the members are not obligated
to purchase the Company’s products. The Company has become
increasingly diligent with regard to all contracted sales
accounts, ensuring that pricing targets are competitive in the
industry. These buying contracts generally have a term of three
years with extensions as warranted. The Company’s current
arrangements with Novation and Health Trust Purchasing Group
expire in 2007. The Company has extended its contract with
Premier until August 2004 and is currently negotiating a
new contract with Premier which is expected to expire in
2007. The Company contemplates entering into future additional
national contracts with other managed care accounts and buying
groups.

In the Americas, the Company maintains an
extensive monitoring and incentive system ranking sales agents
across a range of performance metrics. The Company evaluates and
rewards sales agents based on achieving certain sales targets
and on maintaining efficient levels of working capital. The
Company sets expectations for efficient management of inventory
and provides sales agents a strong motivation to
aid in the collection of receivables because
the Company does not pay them the full amount of their
sales commission until the Company receives payment.

Europe.

The European
geographic segment accounted for 19.2 percent of
2003 net sales, with France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom collectively accounting for
more than 80 percent of net sales in the region. In
addition, the Company also operates in other key markets such as
the Benelux, Nordic, and Central and Eastern Europe. The
Company’s sales force in this region is also comprised of
independent distributors, commissioned agents, direct sales
associates and sales support personnel. With the acquisition of
Centerpulse, the Company has substantially increased its
presence in the European orthopaedic reconstructive implant
market.

Asia Pacific.

The
Asia Pacific geographic segment accounted for 17.2 percent
of 2003 net sales, with Japan being the largest market
within this segment, accounting for the majority of sales
in this region. In Japan and most countries in the Asia Pacific
region, the Company maintains a network of dealers who act
principally as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the
region, together with sales associates and sales support
personnel who build and maintain strong relationships with
musculoskeletal surgeons in their markets. The knowledge and
skills of the Company’s sales associates play a critical
role in Japan because many surgeons perform orthopaedic
surgeries infrequently and must rely on orthopaedic sales
personnel for product support


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

and information. The Company has strengthened,
and intends to continue to support the clinical needs of
Japanese surgeons primarily through sponsorship of medical
education conferences relating to orthopaedic surgery.

The Company’s business is generally not
seasonal in nature; however, many of the Company’s products
are used in elective procedures, which typically decline during
the summer months and holiday seasons.

DISTRIBUTION

The Company generally ships its orders via
overnight courier. The Company’s operations support local
language labeling for all shipments to the European Union member
countries. The Company operates distribution facilities, among
other places, in Warsaw, Indiana; Dover, Ohio; Statesville,
North Carolina; Memphis, Tennessee; Austin, Texas; Carlsbad,
California; and internationally in Australia, Belgium, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands,
Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The
Company’s backlog of firm orders is not considered material
to an understanding of its business.

PRODUCTS

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and
markets reconstructive orthopaedic implants, including joint and
dental, spinal implants, and trauma products, and related
orthopaedic surgical products. Orthopaedic reconstructive
implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in
joints such as knees, hips, shoulders, and elbows. Dental
reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in
patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease.
Spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and
neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases,
deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma
products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize
damaged bone or tissue to support the body’s natural
healing process. The Company’s related orthopaedic surgical
products include surgical supplies and instruments designed to
aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures. The Company also has a
limited array of sports medicine products.

Orthopaedic Reconstructive Implants

The majority of reconstructive implant procedures
restore joint function lost due to degenerative diseases such as
arthritis and relieve pain in knees and hips.

In 2001, the Company announced that it had
established a dedicated business team to maximize the potential
patient benefits of applying minimally invasive surgical
techniques to orthopaedic surgery, which the Company refers to
as

MIS Minimally Invasive Solutions

™

(“MIS”

) Procedures and Technologies. A distinct
medical education center, the Zimmer Institute™, with an
approximate 16,000 square foot facility located at the
Company’s global headquarters in Warsaw, Indiana,
opened in March 2003 and has been used to facilitate the
training of over 500 surgeons, sales associates and other
medical professionals on several innovative

MIS

Procedures. The Company expects another 1,400 surgeons
to be trained through the Zimmer Institute and its
satellite locations during 2004.

The Company is currently working with several
global medical centers to evaluate and refine advanced minimally
invasive knee and hip replacement procedures. On
February 3, 2004, the Company announced that it is working
with Johns Hopkins University, a prestigious medical teaching
institution, to advance education in

MIS

Procedures and
Techniques. The Company has also announced a similar
relationship with a group of surgeons affiliated with the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada and the
Company has affiliated and plans to continue to affiliate with
additional North American and international institutions to
provide surgeon education at the Zimmer Institute and its
satellite locations. The principal goals of these

MIS

efforts are to reduce the hardships of having a total joint
replacement, such as the time a patient must spend in
rehabilitation, pain reduction and lost time from work. The
Company is continuing its work to develop navigation systems,
through the use of image-guided surgical technology, to aid
surgeons in learning procedures and gaining confidence in the
placement of instrumentation and implants where navigation is
difficult due to the small incisions necessary in effectuating

MIS

Procedures. The Company is focused both on further
commercializing existing

MIS

approaches and investigating
new ways to apply

MIS

principles to additional
procedures. The Company doubled its financial investment in the

MIS

program in 2003 to more than $20 million,
excluding instruments. For 2004, the

MIS

investment by
the Company is expected to increase to nearly $30 million,
excluding instruments.

Knee Implants

Total knee surgeries typically include a femoral
component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an
articulating surface (placed on the tibial tray). Knee
replacement surgeries include first-time joint replacement
procedures and revision procedures for the replacement, repair
or enhancement of an implant product or component from a
previous procedure. Knee implants are designed to accommodate
different levels of ligament stabilization of the joint.
While some knee implant designs, called cruciate retaining
(“CR”) designs, require the retention of the posterior
cruciate ligament, other designs, called posterior stabilized
(“PS”) designs, provide joint stability without the
posterior cruciate ligament. There are also procedures for
partial reconstruction of the knee, which treat limited knee
degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side
or compartment of the knee with a unicompartmental knee
prosthesis. The Company offers a wide range of products for
specialized knee procedures, including, among others, the
following brands:

NexGen

®
Complete Knee Solution. The

NexGen

knee product line is a
comprehensive system for knee replacement surgery which has had
significant application in PS, CR and revision procedures. The

NexGen

knee system offers joint stability and sizing that
can be tailored to


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

individual patient needs while providing surgeons
with a unified system of interchangeable components. The

NexGen

knee system provides surgeons with complete and
versatile knee instrument options, including milling and
multiple saw blade cutting instrument systems. The breadth and
versatility of the

NexGen

knee system allows surgeons to
change from one type of implant to another during surgery,
according to the needs of the patient, and to support current
surgical philosophies. The ongoing use of

Trabecular Metal
Porous Surface

™ Monoblock Tibial Components implants in
both CR and PS philosophies enhances the Company’s strategy
to add new innovative technologies to this prominent brand.

Trabecular Metal

materials provide a dramatically higher
level of porosity than existing alternatives, are similar in
stiffness and friction to natural bone and are believed to be a
major advancement in orthopaedic materials. The

Trabecular
Metal Porous Surface

technology is currently distributed by
the Company under an exclusive distribution and strategic
alliance with Implex, but, as described above, the Company is in
the process of acquiring Implex and its

Trabecular Metal

technology.

The

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution

Legacy

® Knee-Posterior Stabilized product line
provides stability in the absence of the posterior cruciate
ligament. The PS capabilities have been augmented through the
introduction of the

NexGen Legacy

Posterior
Stabilized Flex Knee (the “LPS-Flex Knee”), a
high-flexion implant that has the potential to safely
accommodate knee flexion up to a 155-degree range of motion in
some patients when implanted using a specialized surgical
technique.

The most recent release in the Company’s
knee product family is the patented

NexGen

CR-Flex Fixed
Bearing Knee, a cruciate ligament retaining system designed with
components to provide a greater range of motion for patients who
require deep bending in their daily activities. The CR-Flex
femoral components, utilizing a patent pending concept, allow
the surgeon to adjust component sizing without removing
additional bone.

The

NexGen

Revision knee product line,
consisting of the

NexGen Legacy Constrained Condylar Knee

(

LCCK

™), the Rotating Hinge Knee, and the
Cruciate Retaining Augmentable (CRA) revision knee
products, is designed with extensive options to accommodate the
variable needs in revision procedures. These products
accommodate more difficult procedures and are augmentable for
bone loss and provide increased constraint for patients with
ligamentous instability. During 2002, the Rotating Hinge Knee
was added to the line for optimal constraint in more severe
cases.

The

NexGen

Osteotomy System offers precise
instrumentation to perform a high tibial osteotomy, to restore
alignment for active patients with unicompartmental
osteoarthritis associated with moderate bone deformities.

The

Natural-Knee®

System. The

Natural-Knee

Prosthesis System consists of a complete
range of interchangeable, anatomically designed implants which
include several innovative features the Company believes cannot
be found in other current systems, including a proprietary

CSTi

™ porous coating option for stable fixation in
active patients, a deepened trochlear groove to maximize range
of motion, and simple to use instrumentation.

The

Natural-Knee

Modular Cemented
Baseplate was launched in 2003. The baseplate complements the
existing system of baseplates and can be used with the primary,
revision and constrained femoral components, as well as all

Natural-Knee

tibial insert configurations. The unique

Natural-Knee

Ultracongruent Posterior Stabilizing Tibial
Insert provides more flexibility to adjust to the needs of the
patient at the time of surgery. The Company believes that the
performance characteristics of the

Natural-Knee

Ultracongruent Posterior Stabilizing Tibial Insert demonstrates
its viability as an alternative to traditional PS designs with
distinct advantages.

M/ G®

and

Allegretto

™ Unicompartmental Knee Systems. The

M/
G

and

Allegretto

Uni systems apply the same
flexibility and quality of the Company’s other knee implant
products to unicompartmental, or single compartment disease.
Both of these systems offer the surgeon the ability
to conserve bone by replacing only the compartment of the
knee that has had degenerative changes. The

M/ G

Uni
system’s patented minimally invasive intramedullary
instrumentation, as well as its new minimally invasive
extramedullary instrumentation, offers accurate alignment,
precise cuts and secure fixation that provide surgeons with the
ability to accurately and efficiently repair damage to
joint surfaces of one knee compartment with predictable,
reproducible results through a small incision. The minimally
invasive instrumentation for the

M/ G

and

Allegretto

Uni systems positions the Company to continue to promote and
capitalize on growing trends toward less invasive surgical
procedures.

The Company has established itself in the use of
minimally invasive knee surgery with the development of
minimally invasive instruments for the

M/ G

Unicompartmental Knee System.

MIS Minimally Invasive
Solutions

Mini-Incision Total Knee Procedures and

MIS
Quad-Sparing

™ Total Knee Procedures have allowed the
Company to build upon its industry position by offering surgeons
the benefits of

MIS

surgery for their total knee
procedures. The

MIS Minimally Invasive Solutions

Mini-Incision Total Knee instruments feature smaller
instruments which accommodate a smaller incision and less
disruption of the surrounding soft tissues. The

MIS
Quad-Sparing

Total Knee Procedure features advanced
instrument concepts which allow surgeons to perform the total
knee arthroplasty through a 7-10 cm incision without
cutting the patient’s muscles or tendons.

Prolong

™
Crosslinked Polyethylene Articular Surfaces. The

Prolong

polyethylene is a bearing surface material for total knee
replacement. The United States Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) has approved the claim
of “resistance to delamination” for the

Prolong

polyethylene


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

product. Most knee articulating surfaces only
receive the more general “resistance to wear” claim
that does not specifically address the primary mode of failure
in knees, which is sub-surface fatigue.

Hip Implants

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the
head of the femur and the socket portion of the pelvis
(acetabulum) of the natural hip and include first time
joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the
replacement, repair or enhancement of an implant product
or component from a previous procedure. The femur is the

long bone between the pelvis and the knee. The acetabulum
is the cup-shaped portion of the pelvis. Historically, most
hip implant procedures have involved the use of bone cement to
attach the prosthetic components to the surrounding bone. Today,
many femoral and acetabulum cup replacement components are
porous, which means they do not require bone cement because bone
can actually grow into, and onto, the implant surface.

The Company’s

MI

S

2-Incision

™ Hip Replacement Procedure uses two small
incisions, each approximately one and one-half to two inches in
length. Standard implants are used in the procedure. The
incision for a traditional open hip replacement is as much as
12 inches long. Other less invasive approaches, such as a
“mini” incision for hips, have been in existence for
approximately five years. In January 2004, the first computer
image-guided

MIS 2-Incision

live surgery was performed
utilizing new technology and instrumentation co-developed by the
Company and its

MIS

computer navigation partner,
Medtronic. In February 2004, the United States Patent and
Trademark Office granted the Company a patent specific to the
Company’s

MIS 2-Incision

Hip Replacement Procedure,
and such patent includes 17 approved claims related to the
procedure.

The Company’s hip replacement products
include, among others:

VerSys

® Hip
System. The

VerSys

Hip System, a Zimmer flagship brand,
is supported by a common instrumentation set and is an
innovative, integrated family of hip products that offers
surgeons design-specific options to meet varying surgical
philosophies and patient needs. The

VerSys

Hip System
includes the following features: a variety of stem designs and
fixation options for both primary and revision situations, a
modular design that allows for a variety of femoral heads,
optimal sizing selections, and a common instrumentation set for
use with virtually all

VerSys

stems. In addition,
the flexibility of the

VerSys

stem platform allows
for the incorporation of technological developments, with
the planned introduction of approximately 340 new stems, 139 of
which were launched in 2003.

The

Natural-Hip

™ Prosthesis Solution.
The

Natural-Hip

Prosthesis Solution combines the surgical
simplicity of a straight stem with many of the best features
of an anatomic stem. The

Natural-Hip

system’s
innovative design approach provides optimal cortical loading and
bone remodeling without sacrificing ease of implantation. A
complete system of porous-coated and nonporous stems cover the
full spectrum of patient bone types and sizes with a single
set of easy-to-use instruments. The comprehensive

Natural-Hip

Prosthesis Solution product line offers a
variety of stem options to address high, medium, and low demand
patients, as well as revision and other special patient needs.

Alloclassic

®
(

Zweymueller

™) Hip Prosthesis. The

Alloclassic
(Zweymueller)

Hip Prosthesis has become the most used,
primary, cementless hip in the world. This is one of the few
stems available today that is practically unchanged since its
introduction in 1979. There have been only a few modifications
over the years to address demands of patients and surgeons. The
Company believes that this product’s technically simple
application, outstanding short and long-term stability, and
excellent clinical results will continue to make it desirable to
surgeons.

ZMR

® and

Revitan®

Revision Hip Systems. The

ZMR

Revision Hip System, introduced in 2000 to address the porous
modular revision market, and the

Revitan

Revision Hip
System, provide the versatility to accommodate varying fixation
and sizing needs. The line extension to the

ZMR

brand of
over 90 additional implant options creating over 10,800 possible
combinations will enable surgeons to further address the
difficult and varying needs of their revision patients. Building
on the

ZMR

and

Revitan

Revision Hip Systems, the
launch of revision acetabular components positions the Company
to provide a comprehensive approach to revision hip surgery that
matches its approach to revision knee surgery.

Specialty Hips.

To
complement the broad capabilities of the above hip brands, the
Company offers a number of specialty hip products tailored
to the needs of specific patient populations and geographic
regions. The

Mayo Conservative Hip
Prosthesis

®


, a novel, short-stemmed, porous
femoral implant, was developed for minimal bone removal. The

CPT

® Hip System, the cemented hip brand designed for
both primary and revision procedures, was tailored for countries
with a historical preference towards collarless, polished,
tapered products and a subsidence surgical philosophy. A key
line extension to the

CPT

brand was launched in late 2002
and was instrumental to the growth of this cemented stem line in
2003. This implant system has a long and successful clinical
record and is important to growth in key markets such as Europe.
In addition to Community European (“CE”) Mark approval
in 2000, the Company received regulatory approval in the United
States in 2002 for the

Epoch

® Hip Prosthesis product
line, which is comprised, in part, of a unique composite design
that allows the normal amount of anatomical stress to be placed
on patients’ bones while still potentially providing
extensive fixation and reduced thigh pain. The Company also
launched the

Zimmer

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND QUALITY
SYSTEMS

The Company is subject to government regulation
with regard to its products and operations in the countries in
which it conducts business. It is the policy of the Company
to comply with all regulatory requirements applicable to
its products and operations.

In the United States, numerous regulations govern
the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and
distribution of medical devices, including, among others, the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations issued or
proposed thereunder. The FDA regulates product safety and
efficacy, laboratory and manufacturing practices, labeling and
record keeping for medical devices and review of required
manufacturers’ reports of adverse experience to identify
potential problems with marketed medical devices. A few of the
devices developed and marketed by the Company are in a category
for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical
investigation and pre-market approval requirements. The FDA has
the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical
devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical
devices; or order the repair, replacement or refund of the costs
of such devices. There are also certain requirements of state,
local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the
manufacture and marketing of the Company’s products.

In many of the foreign countries in which the
Company markets its products, the Company is subject to local
regulations affecting, among other things, product standards,
packaging requirements, labeling requirements and import. Many
of the regulations applicable to the Company’s devices and
products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The
member countries of the European Union have adopted the European
Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical
device regulations for all member countries. These regulations
require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute
medical devices in European Union member countries to obtain CE
Marks for their products. The Company maintains a certified
status with the European and Canadian Notified Bodies, which
provides for CE marking of products for these markets.

Regulatory requirements affecting the Company and
its products have continued to increase. It is the policy of the
Company to comply with all regulatory requirements governing its
operations and products, and the Company believes that the
manufacturing, quality control and internal control procedures
that it employs are in material compliance with all applicable
regulations.

Government agencies and legislative bodies in the
United States and throughout the world influence or regulate
medical device payment. The Company believes that its experience
in dealing with governmental regulatory requirements, its
efficient means of distribution and its emphasis on the ongoing
development of efficacious, cost effective and technologically
advanced products should enable it to continue to compete
effectively within this regulated environment.

The Company is subject to various government
regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including
anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Violations
of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions,
including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within
the United States, exclusion from participation in government
healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans
Administration (VA) health programs and Civilian Health and
Medical Program Uniformed Service (CHAMPUS). The scope and
enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and
subject to rapid change, especially in light of the lack of
applicable precedent and regulations. The Company believes that
its operations are in material compliance with these laws.


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

The Company is committed to providing high
quality products to its customers. To meet this commitment, the
Company has implemented modern quality systems and concepts
throughout the organization. The quality assurance department
supervises the Company’s quality systems. Senior management
is actively involved in setting quality policies and managing
internal and external quality performance. The Company’s
regulatory affairs and compliance department is responsible for
assuring compliance with all applicable regulations, standards
and internal policies.

Since 1998, the Company has initiated numerous
quality improvement programs and maintains an excellent
compliance record. All of the Company’s manufacturing
operations are ISO 9000 and/or ISO 13485/13488 series
certified.

The Company’s facilities and operations are
also subject to various government environmental and
occupational health and safety requirements of the United States
and foreign countries, including those relating to discharges of
substances in the air, water and land, the handling, storage and
disposal of wastes and the cleanup of properties by pollutants.
The Company believes it is currently in material compliance with
such requirements.

COMPETITION

The orthopaedics industry is highly competitive.
In the global markets for reconstructive implants, trauma
and orthopaedic surgical products, major competitors include:
DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Johnson & Johnson), Stryker Corp., Biomet, Inc.,
Synthes-Stratec, Inc. and Smith & Nephew, plc.

In the Americas geographic segment, DePuy
Orthopaedics, Inc., Stryker Corp. and Biomet, Inc.,
along with the Company, account for a large majority of the
total reconstructive implant sales.

In the Asia Pacific market for reconstructive
implant and trauma products, the Company competes primarily
with DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Stryker Corp., as well as
regional companies, including Kyocera and MDM. Factors, such as
the dealer system, complex regulatory environments and the
accompanying inability to compete on price, make it difficult
for smaller companies, particularly those that are non-regional,
to compete effectively with the market leaders in the Asia
Pacific region.

In Europe, the reconstructive implant and trauma
product markets are more fragmented than the Americas or the
Asia Pacific segments. The variety of philosophies held by
European surgeons regarding hip reconstruction, for example, has
fostered the existence of many small, niche European companies.
Today most hip implants sold in Europe are products developed
specifically for Europe, although global products are gaining
acceptance. Therefore, the Company, in addition to its global
products, will continue to develop and produce specially
tailored products to meet specific European needs. Particularly
with the acquisition of Centerpulse, the Company believes it is
well positioned in this region in the reconstructive
implant market.

In the spinal implant area, the Company competes
globally primarily with Medtronic/ Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Medtronic, Inc.), Synthes-Stratec, Inc.,
DePuy Spine (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson),
Stryker Corp., and EBI, L.P. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.).

In the dental reconstructive implant area, the
Company competes primarily with Nobel Biocare AB, Straumann AG,
and Implant Innovations, Inc. (a subsidiary of
Biomet, Inc.).

Competition within the industry is primarily
based on technology, innovation, quality, reputation, customer
relationships and service. A key factor in the Company’s
continuing success in the future will continue to be its ability
to develop new products and improve upon existing products and
technologies. Where possible, the Company will continue to seek
patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection
concerning the surgical techniques, materials, technologies and
products it designs and develops.

MANUFACTURING AND RAW MATERIALS

The Company manufactures substantially all of its
products at nine facilities located in the United States, Puerto
Rico, Switzerland and France. Specifically, the Company
presently conducts manufacturing operations for various product
areas in Warsaw, Indiana; Winterthur, Switzerland; Ponce,
Puerto Rico; Dover, Ohio; Austin, Texas


;
Statesville, North Carolina; Calabassas, California; Carlsbad,
California; and Etupes, France. The Company believes that its
manufacturing facilities set industry standards in terms of
automation and have the flexibility to accommodate future
growth. The manufacturing operations at these facilities are
designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and
to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on
continuous operational improvement. In addition, at certain of
the Company’s manufacturing facilities, many of the
employees are cross-trained.

The Company generally operates its manufacturing
facilities at its targeted goal of approximately 90 percent
of total capacity. The Company continually evaluates the
potential to in-source products currently purchased from outside
vendors to on-site production. The Company is currently in the
process of expanding certain of its facilities.

Improving manufacturing productivity has been a
major contributor to the Company’s profitability
improvements in recent years. Major areas of improvement have
included utilization of computer-assisted robots to precision
polish medical devices, automation of certain manufacturing
processes, in-sourcing of core products, high-speed machining,
and negotiated reductions in raw materials costs.

The Company uses a diverse and broad range of raw
materials in the design, development and manufacturing of its
products. The Company purchases all of its raw materials and
select components used in manufacturing its products from
external suppliers. In addition, the Company purchases some
supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance,

    facility by the end of 2005.

sole source availability, cost effectiveness or
constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. The Company
works closely with its suppliers to assure continuity of supply
while maintaining high quality and reliability. Alternative
supplier options are generally considered and identified,
although the Company does not typically pursue regulatory
qualification of alternative sources due to the strength of its
existing supplier relationships and the time and expense
associated with the regulatory process. Although a change in
suppliers could require significant effort or investment by the
Company in circumstances where the items supplied are integral
to the performance of the Company’s products or incorporate
unique technology, the Company does not believe that the loss of
any existing supply contract would have a material adverse
effect on its financial and operational performance. To date,
the Company has not experienced any significant difficulty in
locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill
its production schedules.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The Company believes that patents and other
proprietary rights are important to the continued success of its
business and the Company also relies upon trade secrets,
know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing
opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position.
The Company protects its proprietary rights through a variety of
methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary
information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and
others who may have access to proprietary information.

With the acquisition of Centerpulse, the Company
now owns or controls through licensing arrangements more than
2,130 issued patents and more than 1,340 patent
applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the
technology incorporated in many of the Company’s products.

EMPLOYEES

As a result of the acquisition of Centerpulse,
the Company employs more than 6,500 employees worldwide,
including more than 550 employees dedicated to research and
development. Approximately 4,000 employees are located
within the United States and more than 2,500 employees are
located outside of the United States, primarily in Japan and
throughout Europe. Nearly 200 North American employees are
members of a trade union covered by a collective bargaining
agreement. In addition, approximately 70 employees are
represented by a union in the United Kingdom.

In May 2000, the Company renewed a collective
bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of America
covering employees at the Dover, Ohio, facility. The term of
this agreement was further extended as of May 15, 2003 and
will continue in effect until May 15, 2007. The agreement
automatically renews thereafter on a year-to-year basis until
either party gives written notice of its intent to terminate the
agreement, 60 days prior to a termination date. The Company
believes that its relationship with its employees and the unions
that represent them is good.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking
statements.

OVERVIEW

The Company is a global leader in the design,
development, manufacture and marketing of reconstructive
orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal
implants, and trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical
products. Orthopaedic reconstructive implants restore joint
function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees,
hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants
restore function and aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth
due to trauma or disease. Spinal implants are utilized by
orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of
degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in all regions of
the spine. Trauma products are devices used primarily to
reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the
body’s natural healing process. The Company’s related
orthopaedic surgical products include supplies and instruments
designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures. With
operations in more than 24 countries and products marketed in
more than 80 countries, operations are managed through three
reportable geographic segments – the Americas, Europe
and Asia Pacific.

Events Affecting Operating Performance in
2003.

Centerpulse results of
operations have been included in the Company’s results
subsequent to the completion of that acquisition on
October 2, 2003, and their respective assets and
liabilities have been recorded at their estimated fair values in
the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position
as of October 2, 2003, with the excess purchase price being
allocated to goodwill. The pending acquisition of Implex
gives the Company enhanced flexibility in the development of
products using

Trabecular Metal

Technology, which the
Company believes has significant potential in orthopaedic
reconstructive and spinal product applications.

The Company continues to make significant
progress in the development and introduction of

MIS

Procedures and Technologies. This includes the
continued rollout of the Zimmer

MIS


-Incision

Hip
Replacement Procedure, and the development of the

MIS
Quad-Sparing

Total Knee Procedure that the Company
introduced at the 2004 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons
meeting in San Francisco. The Company believes such
innovative approaches will significantly impact the orthopaedics
industry. Since its opening in March 2003, the Zimmer
Institute in Warsaw, Indiana has seen extensive
use for

MIS

education, new product development
meetings and sales training programs. During the year, the
Company continued to expand the Zimmer Institute’s global
affiliations.

With the acquisition of Centerpulse, the Company
begins an exciting new chapter in its history. The successful
integration of the Centerpulse business, which began in the
fourth quarter, is the Company’s critical objective for the
near term. More than 100 full time personnel from Zimmer,
Centerpulse and independent professional service organizations
are managing more than 275 major integration projects for over
80 legal entities in 80 different countries. The integration
process, under the direction of the Company’s senior
management team, continues to advance. The Company has made
substantial progress in developing global combined product
strategies, in integrating the Company’s U.S. sales
and European business organizations, and in melding essential
activities as diverse as global accounting principles and E-mail
systems. During the year, the Company recorded
$79.6 million (pre-tax) of acquisition and integration
costs for contract terminations, professional fees, employee
severance, retention pay, employee relocation costs and other
expenses. In 2004, the Company expects to incur another
$128.0 million for similar costs and expenses
as integration progresses.

The Company’s operating results in the
fourth quarter, the first quarter for which it reported combined
results, indicated that the acquisition of Centerpulse was
accretive to our shareholders, excluding acquisition and
integration expenses, in-process R&D write-off and inventory
step-up. The Company’s combined gross margin, in the fourth
quarter, including an inventory step-up charge of
$42.7 million, was 68.1 percent directly related to
geographic and product mix, price and strong manufacturing
performance. The Company believes that its reported gross margin
for the fourth quarter, which reflects the combination with
Centerpulse and the consequently higher European revenue
content, remains strong. Other important financial metrics
include the Company’s level of spending on research and
development and its selling, general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of sales. The Company expects over the next
couple of years to continue to invest in research and
development at almost 6 percent of sales, as investments
in spine, biologics and new technology increase. In
management’s view, the Company’s selling, general and
administrative expenses are well managed, closing out the fourth
quarter at 40.9 percent of revenue.

Despite the strong operating performance in the
fourth quarter, the Company expects to realize
approximately $50 million in sales dis-synergies in
2004. The Company believes it is possible, given the complexity
of the Centerpulse combination, that its reconstructive revenue
growth in Europe, for example, may lag the European
reconstructive market as the Company works through integration
challenges in key markets such as France, Italy and Germany.

Economic and Industry Wide Factors Relevant to
the Company.

On a worldwide basis,
price improvement has remained firm at 3-4 percent in the
last two years. The Company realized better than expected growth
in average


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

selling prices at 4 percent in its most
recent quarter in the Americas, the Company’s largest
operating segment. Although the industry has experienced steady
growth in price in the last few years, the Company expects price
growth to moderate in the near term and settle in at rates of
2-3 percent for 2004. Pressure from healthcare cost
containment efforts may affect prices in markets where health
care spending grows at a rate higher than the local economy.
Even though the clinical benefits of joint replacement products
and fixation devices are well documented, the orthopaedic
industry could be subject to such efforts by various consumers
of healthcare in different parts of the world. In Japan, as an
example, where hospital reimbursement prices for medical devices
are set by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the
Company expects pricing to decline 4-6 percent in mid to
late 2004 as compared with the more traditional 2-4 percent
decline experienced in prior bi-annual price adjustments.
Another important factor affecting the industry is global demand
for orthopaedic devices. Orthopaedic procedure volume on a
worldwide basis continues to rise at mid to high single digit
rates driven by an aging global population, proven clinical
benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical
techniques (such as our

MIS

Procedures and Technologies)
and more active lifestyles, among other factors.

Adoption rates for new technologies are another
key indicator of industry performance. In the Company’s
business, revenue has grown with the introduction of new
products such as

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked
Polyethylene Liners which accounted for 11 percent of the
Company’s total Liner sales in its first year of
introduction and now comprises over 90 percent of the
Company’s Liner sales. The Centerpulse companion product

Durasul

® Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene was up
47 percent in the fourth quarter. Crosslinked polyethylene
products generally demand a higher price than standard Liners
due to anticipated improvement in wear characteristics, as
demonstrated in laboratory tests. In 2002, the Company
introduced

Prolong

Crosslinked Polyethylene for the knee,
which is also sold at a premium to standard articulating
surfaces. In the fourth quarter,

Prolong

represented
approximately 42 percent of all cruciate retaining
articulating surface product sales and 14 percent of all
articulating surfaces. While the price premium is significant on
this product, the Company believes its ultimate impact of
resistance to delamination has potentially far ranging medical
and economic benefits. Adoption rates for the Company’s new
products associated with Crosslinked Polyethylene,

MIS

Procedures and Technologies,

Trabecular Metal,

Knee
and Hip Revision products, Interpositional Knee devices, and new
trauma, spine and dental devices will continue to affect the
Company’s operating performance.

In recognition of the importance of the
successful introduction of new technologies, Zimmer has
developed a full time department called – “Health
Technology Assessment and Reimbursement.” This department
has supported the collection and analysis of clinical data to
determine the economic effects of certain surgical procedures
and the use of the Company’s products.

Another important factor affecting operating
performance is foreign currency fluctuations. With a significant
portion of the Company’s revenue derived from sales of its
products outside of the United States, revenues and operating
results are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. A
weakening U.S. dollar throughout 2003 contributed to the
growth in revenue reported in the year ended December 31,
2003, adding four percent of the 20 percent reported
revenue growth, excluding Centerpulse product revenue. The
Company addresses currency risk management through regular
operating and financing activities, and under appropriate
circumstances and subject to proper authorization, through the
use of derivative financial instruments solely for hedging
purposes. The use of derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes is prohibited.

An evolving trend which may affect the industry
and the Company’s operating performance in the future is
connected with how the industry markets its products. Industry
players have recently turned to direct-to-consumer (DTC)
advertising and promotion as a means of promoting new products
and technologies. As this development is in its beginning
stages, it is not possible to predict how this may affect
operating performance, if at all, in the future. The Company has
engaged in relatively low-cost DTC campaigns in connection with
the launch of its

NexGen

LPS-Flex Knee and to publicly
reach out to patients while working with surgeons to introduce

MIS

Technologies and Procedures. The Company has made use
of the Zimmer-owned web site, PaceWithLife.com, which in 2003
resulted in 38,000 “Find a Doc” requests and almost
10,000 marketing packets mailed. And the Company’s

MIS

“Adword” campaigns had more than 30,000
“click-thru’s” on nearly one million impressions.
The Company’s six month national public relations campaign
in 2003 completed the year with almost 170 placements and
reached audiences of close to 15 million people. While
certain competitors are now engaged in more expensive national
advertising, the Company is currently satisfied with the returns
it has experienced with its low-cost DTC campaigns.

Lastly, among the many factors that affect
operating performance within the industry is the development and
protection of intellectual property. In 2003, the Company was
granted a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
for the Zimmer

MIS 2-Incision

Hip Replacement Procedure.
The patent includes 17 approved claims. In addition to the
issued patent, five more Zimmer

MIS 2-Incision

Hip
Procedure patents are pending with a total of 122 additional
claims identified relating to the surgical technique and
instrumentation. Similarly, and equally important, the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued patents for the
Company’s Transformational Technology

MIS

Hip
Fracture Fixation System with 22 product and procedure
claims approved and five patents and 239 claims
outstanding. Furthermore, the Company has seven patents pending
related to its unique

MIS “Quad-Sparing”

or
“QS” Total Knee Procedure with a total of
395 claims covering novel aspects of the procedure and
instrumentation, as well as new implant designs. The Company
believes there is significant potential

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Year Ended December 31, 2003

Compared to Year Ended December 31,

The following table presents the components of
the year-over-year percentage changes in net sales by geographic
segment:

Net sales for the year ended December 31,
2003 increased 39 percent to $1,901.0 million. Sales
growth was driven by strong demand for the Company’s
reconstructive implants and additional sales from the
October 2, 2003 Centerpulse acquisition. The
39 percent increase was comprised of a 20 percent
increase in Zimmer standalone sales and a 19 percent
increase due to the Centerpulse acquisition. “Zimmer
standalone sales” as used herein refers to sales for the
period less sales from acquired Centerpulse businesses.
Favorable demographics, including an aging population and a
continued shift to premium priced products, contributed to the
favorable volume and mix growth. Higher average selling prices
were realized in all three geographic segments. The continued
weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the
Japanese yen were the main contributors to the favorable
impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales.

Net sales in the Americas for the year ended
December 31, 2003 increased 30 percent to
$1,208.3 million. Sales growth was driven by strong demand
for the Company’s reconstructive implants and additional
sales from the Centerpulse acquisition. The 30 percent
increase was comprised of a 19 percent increase in Zimmer
standalone sales plus an 11 percent increase due to the
Centerpulse acquisition. Net sales of reconstructive implants
increased 33 percent to $941.4 million, 22 percent due
to increased Zimmer standalone sales and 11 percent related
to the Centerpulse acquisition. Knee sales increased
32 percent to $523.6 million, 24 percent related to
increased Zimmer standalone sales and 8 percent due to the
Centerpulse acquisition. Hip sales increased 27 percent to
$365.6 million, 21 percent due to increased Zimmer

Net sales in Asia Pacific for the year ended
December 31, 2003 increased 21 percent to
$326.7 million. Sales growth was driven by strong demand
for the Company’s reconstructive implants and additional
sales from the Centerpulse acquisition. The 21 percent
increase was comprised of a 14 percent increase in Zimmer
standalone sales and a 7 percent increase due to the
Centerpulse acquisition. Net sales of reconstructive implants

2003 FORM 10-K

The following table presents the components of
the year-over-year percentage changes in net sales by product
category:

Overall, worldwide reconstructive implant sales
increased 43 percent to $1,521.0 million. The
43 percent increase was comprised of a 23 percent
increase in Zimmer standalone sales and a 20 percent
increase due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Knee sales
increased 37 percent to $800.5 million,
24 percent due to increased Zimmer standalone sales
(increased 20 percent constant currency) and
13 percent due to the Centerpulse acquisition. Knee sales
were led by the

NexGen Legacy

Knee Posterior Stabilized
product line including the LPS-Flex Knee,

NexGen Trabecular
Metal

tibial components and the

NexGen

CR Knee with

Prolong

Crosslinked Polyethylene. Hip sales increased
46 percent to $645.6 million, 24 percent due to
the Centerpulse acquisition and 22 percent due to
increased Zimmer standalone sales (increased 17 percent
constant currency). Hip sales were driven by continued
conversion to porous stems,

Trabecular Metal

acetabular cups, and increased sales of

Trilogy

Acetabular System cups incorporating

Longevity

Highly
Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. Dental sales were
$29.8 million, reflecting solid growth in both standard and
tapered Swiss Plus design implants. Trauma sales increased
13 percent to $151.6 million, 10 percent due to
increased Zimmer standalone sales (increased 7 percent
constant currency) and 3 percent due to the
Centerpulse acquisition. Trauma sales were led by sales of the

Zimmer

Periarticular Plating System. Spine sales were
$33.6 million due to sales from Centerpulse. Orthopaedic
surgical product sales increased 10 percent (7 percent
constant currency) to $194.8 million, primarily driven by
the continued growth of the

OrthoPAT

Orthopedic
Perioperative Autotransfusion System.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was
72.8 percent in 2003 compared to 74.9 percent in 2002.
Gross profit for 2003 was reduced $42.7 million, or
2.2 percent of net sales, as a result of an inventory
step-up charge recognized in connection with the Centerpulse
acquisition. Sales and gross profit from Centerpulse also
reduced reported gross margins as Centerpulse has a greater
percentage of sales based in Europe, where gross margins are
historically lower than the U.S. and Japan. Increased Zimmer
standalone average selling prices in all geographic segments,
the continued conversion from cemented implants to higher margin
porous implants and the ongoing efforts to reduce manufacturing
costs through automation, in-sourcing and process improvements
had positive impacts on gross profit. The Company’s
operating plans annually call for reductions in unit
manufacturing cost of its products as a direct result
of a number of factors, including but not limited to,
increased volume, improvements in material technology,
replacement of used machinery and equipment with higher speed
equipment, changes in the configuration of manufacturing
cells designed to increase throughput, labor automation as well
as in-sourcing. Focus on inventory cost reduction is a
strategic imperative. The Company will continue to direct
efforts on driving down costs of products sold, general and
administrative expenses and holding costs associated with
working capital.

Research and development as a percentage of net
sales was 5.6 percent in 2003 compared to 5.9 percent
in 2002, as research and development expenses increased
31 percent from the prior year compared to a
39 percent increase in sales. Research and development
expense increased to $105.8 million from $80.7 million
reflecting research and development expenses from Centerpulse
and increased spending on active projects focused on areas of
strategic significance, including

MIS

Technologies,
innovative materials such as

Trabecular Metal

and Highly
Crosslinked Polyethylene, lifestyle designs, revision implants
and biological solutions. The Company has strategically targeted
R&D spending to be at the high end of what management
believes to be an average of 4-6 percent for the industry.
Maintaining a robust product development pipeline has enabled
Zimmer to achieve significant contributions in revenue from new
products, which management defines as products introduced within
the prior 36 month period. For example, in the fourth
quarter, new product revenue, excluding Centerpulse, represented
18.9 percent of sales, at the high end of the
Company’s stated quarterly and annual goal of
15-20 percent, in place since 1999. Management expects over
the next year or two to continue to invest in R&D at almost
6 percent of sales on a higher revenue base as investments
in spine, biologics and new technology increase.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
(“SG&A”) as a percentage of net sales
were 38.8 percent in 2003 compared to 39.8 percent
(39.4 percent assuming the change in accounting principle
for instruments is applied retroactively) in 2002. Low cost
inflation accompanied with double digit revenue growth has
driven the overall expense ratio lower for the year. Detailed
planning, monitoring and control over these expenses have also
contributed to the improvement. While well managed, the Company
has introduced programs and activities in 2003 that involve
significant investments, which, in part, are reflected in
SG&A. As an example, the Zimmer Institute has seen very
active use in 2003. The Zimmer Institute, which is used for
surgeon training, product development activities such as
prototype evaluations and product and instrument training for
independent field sales representatives, provided training

for over 500 surgeons, physician assistants and nurses on

the

MIS

acquisition.


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

MIS Quad-Sparing Total Knee Procedure over
the course of 2003. The cost of training is borne by the Company
and reported in SG&A. The acquisition of Centerpulse
resulted in higher SG&A as a percentage of sales in the
fourth quarter. The change in accounting principle for
instruments favorably impacted SG&A by $26.8 million,
or 1.4 percent of net sales, in 2003.

Acquisition and integration expenses related to
the acquisition of Centerpulse and InCentive were
$79.6 million, including $36.1 million of sales agent
and lease contract termination expenses, $15.4 million of
integration consulting expenses, $10.2 million of employee
severance and retention expenses, $6.4 million of
professional fees, $5.3 million of costs for meetings and
activities associated with the initial cross-training of
employees and independent sales representatives,
$2.4 million of investment banking fees incurred by
Centerpulse, $2.0 million of personnel expenses and travel
for full-time integration team members, $0.6 million of
employee relocation expenses and $1.2 million of other
miscellaneous acquisition and integration expenses.

Operating profit increased 12 percent to
$450.7 million. Operating profit growth was driven by
strong organic sales growth, operating profit contributed by
Centerpulse and effectively controlled operating expenses. In
addition, the change in accounting principle for instruments
favorably impacted operating profit by $26.8 million. These
favorable items were offset by Centerpulse inventory step-up of
$42.7 million, Centerpulse in-process research and
development write-offs of $11.2 million and Centerpulse
acquisition and integration expenses of $79.6 million.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the
year ended December 31, 2003 was 33.6 percent,
compared to 33.7 percent in 2002. The decrease from
33.7 percent to 33.6 percent was due to expanded
operations in Puerto Rico and the implementation of certain
business strategies in 2002 which resulted in reducing taxes in
certain jurisdictions and increased credits, offset by
non-deductible in-process research and development charges.

Net earnings increased 34 percent to
$346.3 million from $257.8 million in 2002,
driven by strong organic sales growth, earnings contributed
by Centerpulse, leveraged operating expenses and the one-time,
non-cash cumulative

effect of change in accounting principle for instruments of
$55.1 million (net of tax), offset by Centerpulse inventory
step-up of $28.0 million (net of tax), Centerpulse
in-process research and development write-offs of
$11.2 million and Centerpulse acquisition and integration
expenses of $51.1 million (net of tax). Basic and diluted
earnings per share increased 26 percent and 25 percent
to $1.67 and $1.64, respectively, from $1.33 and $1.31 in 2002.

Year Ended December 31, 2002

Compared to Year Ended December 31,

Net sales for the year ended December 31,
2002, increased 16 percent. Sales growth reflected strong
demand for the Company’s reconstructive implants, including
the

NexGen

line of knee products and the

VerSys

Hip System. New products launched within the last
36 months represented 18 percent of total sales,
including the successful recent launches of key products
including the

Prolong

Crosslinked Polyethylene for

NexGen

CR Knee, the

NexGen Trabecular Metal

Monoblock tibials, the

NexGen

Rotating Hinge Knee and
the

Trabecular Metal

acetabular cups. Favorable
demographics helped drive increased surgical procedures in all
regions, with the Company’s largest operating segment, the
Americas, as well as Europe, leading the overall outstanding
results. The increase was comprised of a 12 percent
increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of
product sales and a 4 percent increase due to higher
average selling prices.

Net sales in the Americas increased
18 percent for the year to $932.9 million
compared to 2001. This increase was comprised of a
13 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes
in the mix of product sales, together with a 5 percent
increase due to higher average selling prices. Sales of
reconstructive implants increased by 21 percent with strong
sales in all categories. Knee sales increased 24 percent
led by growth in sales of

ZPS.

Net sales in Asia Pacific increased
6 percent (increased 8 percent constant currency) for
the year to $269.6 million. This increase was comprised of
a 7 percent increase due to incremental volume and changes
in the mix of product sales and 1 percent increase due to
higher average selling prices, offset by a 2 percent
decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Knee sales
increased 9 percent (increased 11 percent constant
currency) reflecting continued strong growth in the

NexGen

LPS-Flex Knee. Hip sales increased 11 percent
(increased 14 percent constant currency) driven primarily
by the continued conversion to porous stems and sales of

Trilogy

Acetabular System cups incorporating

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners. Trauma product sales
decreased 13 percent (decreased 10 percent constant
currency) reflecting a decline in

M/DN

®
Intramedullary Fixation nails and compression hip screw sales,
primarily in Japan.

Net sales in Europe increased 28 percent
(increased 23 percent constant currency) to
$169.9 million. The strong sales reflected high demand on
reconstructive implants. Eastern Europe, Finland, France,
Scandinavia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom all achieved
higher than 30 percent growth in reconstructive implant
sales. This increase was comprised of 20 percent due to
incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales, a
3 percent increase due to higher average selling prices and
a 5 percent increase due


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Knee sales
increased 27 percent (increased 22 percent constant
currency) driven by strong sales of the

NexGen Legacy

system of knee prostheses, including the LPS-Flex Knee, the

M/G

Unicompartmental Knee system with

MIS

Instrumentation, and the recently launched

NexGen

Rotating Hinge Knee. Hip sales increased 33 percent
(increased 28 percent constant currency) driven by strong
sales of

Trilogy

Acetabular System cups incorporating

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners,

VerSys

porous stems, supported by the ZMR Revision Hip
System and

Trabecular Metal

acetabular cups.

Overall, worldwide reconstructive implant sales
increased 20 percent (increased 20 percent constant
currency) to $1,061.7 million. Knee sales increased by 22
percent (increased 21 percent constant currency) to
$586.1 million, led by the

NexGen Legacy

Knee
Posterior Stabilized product line including the LPS-Flex Knee,

NexGen Trabecular Metal

tibial components, the

NexGen

CR Knee with

Prolong

Crosslinked Polyethylene,
and the

M/G

Unicompartmental Knee system with

MIS

Instrumentation. Hip sales increased 17 percent
(increased 17 percent constant currency) to
$441.1 million driven by continued conversion to porous
stems,

Trabecular Metal

acetabular cups, and increased
sales of

Trilogy

Acetabular System cups incorporating

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners.

Longevity

Liner sales comprised 85 percent of
primary hip liner sales in 2002. Trauma sales increased
4 percent (increased 5 percent constant currency) to
$133.8 million, led by sales of the

Zimmer

Periarticular Plating System. Orthopaedic surgical product
sales increased by 8 percent (increased 9 percent
constant currency) to $176.9 million, led by the continued
growth of the

OrthoPAT

Orthopedic Perioperative
Autotransfusion System.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was
74.9 percent in 2002 compared to 72.7 percent in 2001,
which included separation costs of $11.9 million, or 1.2
percent of sales. The increase was attributable to increased
average selling prices realized in all segments, the continued
conversion from cemented hip implants to higher margin porous
products, increased penetration of

Longevity

Highly
Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners, higher sales of revision
implants and various manufacturing improvements. The Company
upgraded its automated foundry process for casting knee
femorals, hip stems and cups. An increased number
of products were moved to robotic polishing, as well as,
additional porous knee femorals converted to the fiber metal
laser welding process. Several products previously purchased
from outside suppliers were moved in house for production.
Investments in high speed machining and new tooling technologies
made improvements in reducing both product cycle times and
scrap. Lastly, standardization of the Company’s
manufacturing processes resulted in improvement in efficiency.

Research and development as a percentage of net
sales was 5.9 percent in 2002 compared to 6.1 percent
in 2001, which included separation costs of $3.2 million.
Increases in research and development costs outpaced sales
growth, reflecting investments in active and new projects, and
is consistent with the Company’s stated target to be at the
higher end of the industry average, or approximately
6 percent of sales. The Company has many active projects
underway focused on areas of strategic significance, including

MIS

Technologies and the establishment of the Zimmer
Institute, innovative materials such as

Trabecular Metal

and Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene, lifestyle designs,
revision implants and biotechnology.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of net sales were 39.8 percent in 2002 compared
to 45.6 percent in 2001, which included separation costs of
$54.9 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased 1.7 percent to $546.0 million in 2002 from
$537.1 million, including separation costs of
$54.9 million, or 4.7 percent of sales, in 2001.
The expense ratio reflects lower selling expenses as a result of
lower costs associated with the Company’s
U.S. distributor network, sales force and dealer
reorganization in Japan, and improved efficiency in the
utilization of instruments (more frequent use of instruments
resulted in fewer placements and less expense). This was
partially offset by approximately $2 million of consulting
costs associated with tax services and analysis of various
external development opportunities, continued investments
in various strategic initiatives including

MIS

Technologies, DTC advertising, training and medical
education, and higher insurance premiums.

Operating profit increased 62 percent in
2002 to $400.9 million from $248.3 million in 2001 due
to strong sales growth and controlled increases in operating
expenses at rates below sales growth.

The effective tax rate on earnings before taxes
decreased to 33.7 percent in 2002 compared to
37.8 percent in 2001. The decrease was due to expanded
operations in Puerto Rico, increased R&D credits, higher
foreign tax credits and the implementation of certain business
strategies in 2002 which resulted in reducing taxes in certain
jurisdictions and increased credits.

Net earnings increased 72 percent to
$257.8 million from $149.8 million in 2001, due
to strong sales growth and improved gross profit,
lower rate of increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses than sales and the incurrence of
$70.0 million ($49.9 million, net of tax) of
separation costs in 2001. Basic and diluted earnings per
share increased 73 percent and 70 percent to
$1.33 and $1.31, respectively, from $0.77 in 2001.

OPERATING PROFIT BY SEGMENT

Company management evaluates operating segment
performance based upon segment operating profit exclusive of
operating expenses pertaining to global operations and corporate
expenses, acquisition and integration expenses, inventory
step-up, in-process research and development write-offs and
separation costs from the Company’s former parent. For more
information regarding the Company’s segments, see
Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

2003 FORM 10-K

The following table sets forth the operating
profit margin by segment for the years ended December 31,
2003,

2002 and 2001:

Percent of net sales

Year Ended December 31, 2003

Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Operating profit for the Americas as a percentage
of net sales increased due to improved gross margins driven by
higher average selling prices and increased sales of higher
margin products, leveraged operating expenses and the favorable
impact of the change in accounting principle for instruments.
The change in accounting principle for instruments increased
operating profit by 1.7 percentage points. With respect to
sales growth, increased Zimmer standalone average selling prices
of 4 percent in 2003 and favorable effects of volume and
mix, 15 percent increase in 2003, represent the most
significant factors in improved operating profit in the
Americas. As reconstructive implant sales grow at a higher rate
than trauma and orthopaedic surgical products, operating profit
margins generally tend to improve since reconstructive product
sales generally earn higher gross margins. This was the case in
2003, with Zimmer standalone reconstructive implant sales growth
of 22 percent as compared with total Zimmer standalone
sales growth of 19 percent. In the fourth quarter, the
Company reported operating profit as a percent of net sales of
50.4 percent for the Americas.

Operating profit for Europe as a percentage of
net sales increased due to improved gross profit margins driven
by higher Zimmer standalone average selling prices and favorable
product and country mix, leveraged operating expenses and the
favorable impact of the change in accounting principle for
instruments. The change in accounting for instruments increased
operating profit by 1.4 percentage points. Increases in
Zimmer standalone average selling prices in Europe of
2 percent in 2003 and the effect of volume and mix,
19 percent increase in 2003, were the key factors in
improved operating profit. Also contributing to the improvement
was significantly lower growth in operating expenses. In the
fourth quarter, the Company reported operating profit as a
percent of net sales of 24.7 percent for Europe.

Operating profit for Asia Pacific as a percentage
of net sales decreased primarily due to less favorable
rates on hedge contracts during the year compared to the
prior year, partially offset by increased Zimmer standalone
average selling prices and leveraged operating expenses. The
change in accounting for instruments had an immaterial effect on
operating profit for Asia Pacific. Increases in Zimmer
standalone average selling prices in Asia Pacific of
1 percent and volume and mix improvements of 4 percent
in 2003 contributed modest improvement but was offset by higher
cost of products sold. Included in cost of product sold are
losses on foreign exchange hedge contracts, which increased in
2003 relative to 2002. In the fourth quarter, the Company
reported operating profit as a percent of net sales of
47.1 percent for Asia Pacific.

Year Ended December 31, 2002

Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Operating profit for the Americas as a percentage
of net sales increased to 48.3 percent in 2002 from
47.4 percent in 2001, reflecting improved gross profit
margins due to higher average selling prices and increased sales
of higher margin products, and lower selling expenses as a
percent of sales due to lower costs associated with the
U.S. distributor network. The Americas continued to invest
in strategic initiatives such as

MIS

Technologies, field
sales personnel, medical education programs and new product
launches.

Operating profit for Asia Pacific as a percentage
of net sales increased to 46.1 percent in 2002 from
45.4 percent in 2001. This increase reflects lower
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
sales in Japan as a result of a sales force and dealer
reorganization, partially offset by lower gross profit margins
as a result of lower yen hedge gains compared to 2001.

Operating profit for Europe as a percentage of
net sales increased to 24.4 percent in 2002 from
19.5 percent in 2001, due to improved gross profit margins
as a result of higher average selling prices and favorable
product and country mix, the leveraging of sales growth in
Europe on controlled increases in operating expenses and
improved efficiency in the utilization of instruments (more
frequent use of instruments resulted in fewer placements and
less expense).

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows provided by operations were
$494.8 million

in 2003, compared with $220.2 million in
2002. The principal source of cash was net earnings before
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of
$291.2 million. Non-cash expenses for the period included
depreciation and amortization expense of $103.3 million,
Centerpulse inventory step-up of $42.7 million and
Centerpulse in-process research and development write-offs of
$11.2 million. Working capital management, together with
the collection of $20.0 million of cash related to
Centerpulse tax loss carryforwards, contributed
$80.4 million to operating cash flow.

Working capital continues to be a key management
focus. At December 31, 2003, the Company had 62 days
of sales outstanding in accounts receivable, unfavorable to the
prior year by 10 days. Acquired Centerpulse businesses had
a negative impact of 10 days, due to Centerpulse’s
business mix which has a greater proportion of European revenue
with payment terms generally longer than those in the
U.S. At December 31, 2003, the Company had
232 days of inventory on hand compared to 247 days
reported at the end of 2002. The reduction was principally due
to improved inventory management and the acquired dental and
spinal businesses carrying fewer days of inventory.


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

Cash flows used in investing activities were
$1,102.7 million in 2003 compared with $35.7 million
in 2002. The increase was principally due to the Centerpulse and
InCentive acquisitions, which included cash payments to former
Centerpulse and InCentive shareholders of $1,187.1 million
and cash payments for direct acquisition costs of
$37.2 million, offset by cash acquired of
$296.6 million. During June 2003, the Company acquired the

TransFx

External Fixation System product line from
Immedica, Inc. for $14.8 million. In addition, the
January 1, 2003 change in accounting principle for
instruments resulted in the Company classifying instrument
purchases as capital expenditures during 2003 versus being
expensed in 2002. Cash payments for instruments were
$113.6 million during 2003. Instrument purchases increased
to support sales growth, new product launches and

MIS

procedure growth.

Cash flows provided by financing activities
during 2003 were impacted by the Company’s
$1,357 million borrowing on October 2, 2003 to
finance the Centerpulse and InCentive acquisitions, refinance
existing Company debt and debt assumed from Centerpulse, and pay
certain acquisition closing costs. This initial borrowing was
reduced by fourth quarter operating cash flows, including the
collection of $20.0 million of cash related to Centerpulse
tax loss carryforwards, cash received from the exercise of
Company stock options and cash acquired from Centerpulse and
InCentive.

In connection with the Centerpulse and InCentive
acquisitions, the Company entered into the following committed
financing arrangements: (i) $400 million 364-day
revolving credit facility, (ii) $800 million
three-year revolving credit facility and
(iii) $550 million five-year term loan facility,
(collectively, the “Senior Credit Facility”).
Available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility at
December 31, 2003, were approximately $548 million.
Effective on the closing date of the acquisitions, the Company
terminated its $600 million, committed, multi-currency
revolving senior credit facility.

The Company and certain of its wholly owned
foreign and domestic subsidiaries are the borrowers and its
wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are the guarantors of the
Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings may bear interest at the
appropriate LIBOR-based rate, or an alternative base rate, plus
an applicable margin determined by reference to the
Company’s senior unsecured long-term debt rating and the
amounts drawn under the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior
Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative
covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing
arrangement. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage
ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Company is in
compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit Facility
as of December 31, 2003. Commitments under the
$400 million 364-day revolving credit facility and the
$800 million three-year revolving credit facility are
subject to certain fees, including a facility and a utilization
fee.

The Company also has available uncommitted credit
facilities totaling $35 million.

The Company expects to incur Centerpulse
integration expenses during 2004 of approximately
$128.0 million. These expenses are expected to be paid out
principally during 2004 with cash flows from operations and
borrowings available under the Senior Credit Facility.

On March 2, 2004, the Company entered into
an Amended and Restated Merger Agreement relating to the
acquisition of Implex, a privately held orthopaedics company
based in New Jersey, for cash. Each share of Implex stock will
be converted into the right to receive cash having an aggregate
value of approximately $108 million at closing and
additional cash earn-out payments that are contingent on the
growth of Implex product sales through 2006. The net value
transferred at closing will be approximately $89 million,
which includes adjustments for debt repayment, certain payments
previously made by Zimmer to Implex pursuant to their existing
alliance arrangement, escrow and other items. The Company
expects to finance the initial cash payment with borrowings
available under its Senior Credit Facility. The Company expects
to pay the contingent payments, if any, with cash flows from
operations and borrowings available under its Senior Credit
Facility.

The Company had $77.5 million in cash and
equivalents, $14.5 million in restricted cash and
outstanding borrowings of $1,109.1 million as of
December 31, 2003. The Company expects to pay off the
remaining debt balance by the end of 2006 with cash
provided from operations absent any cash requirements for
significant acquisitions. The Company intends to maintain a
capital structure that is consistent with an investment
grade credit rating. As a result of the Centerpulse acquisition,
on September 29, 2003, Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services raised its corporate credit and senior
unsecured ratings on the Company to “BBB” from
“BBB-”. At December 31, 2003, Moody’s
corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings on the Company
were “Baa3”.

Management believes that cash flows from
operations, together with available borrowings under the Senior
Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet the Company’s
working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs.
should investment opportunities arise, the Company believes that
its earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow the
Company to obtain additional capital, if necessary.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The Company has entered into contracts with
various third parties in the normal course of business which
will require future payments. The following table illustrates
the Company’s contractual obligations:

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The financial results of the Company are affected
by the selection and application of accounting policies and
methods. Significant accounting policies which require
management’s judgment are discussed below.

Excess Inventory and
Instruments

– The Company
must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any,
of its inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or
unsaleable at its carrying cost. Similarly, the Company must
also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive
use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves
are established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments
to net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of
reserves, the Company evaluates current stock levels in relation
to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of its
products and instrument systems and components. The basis for
the determination is generally the same for all inventory and
instrument items and categories except for work-in-progress
inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued
items are generally destroyed and completely written off.
Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves
based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other
factors on a regular basis. Centerpulse historically applied a
similar conceptual framework in estimating market value of
excess inventory and instruments under International Financial
Reporting Standards and U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Within that framework, Zimmer and Centerpulse
differed however, in certain respects, to their approaches to
such estimation. Following the acquisition, the Company
determined that a consistent approach is necessary to
maintaining effective control over financial reporting.
Consideration was given to both approaches and the Company
established a common estimation technique taking both prior
approaches into account. This change in estimate resulted in a
charge to earnings of $3.0 million after tax in the fourth
quarter. Such change is not considered material to the
Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Income
Taxes

– The Company
estimates income tax expense and income tax liabilities and
assets by taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax
assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on the
Company’s ability to generate future taxable income
sufficient to realize the benefits. The Company evaluates
deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides
valuation allowances if it is determined to be “more likely
than not” that the deferred tax benefit will not be
realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of
the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be
remitted to the U.S. The Company operates within numerous
taxing jurisdictions. The Company is subject to regulatory
review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and
those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to
resolve. The Company makes use of all available information and
makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring
interpretation in establishing tax expense, liabilities and
reserves. The Company believes adequate provisions exist for
income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to
review or audit.

Commitments and
Contingencies

– Accruals for
product liability and other claims are established with internal
and external counsel based on current information and historical
settlement information for claims, related fees and for claims
incurred but not reported. An actuarial model is used by the
Company to assist management in determining an appropriate level
of accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of
claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to
arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in
the actuarial model. The amounts established represent
management’s best estimate of the ultimate costs that it
will incur under the various contingencies.

SEPARATION FROM BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB

The Company was incorporated in Delaware as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb on
January 12, 2001. On July 25, 2001, Bristol-Myers
Squibb transferred the assets and liabilities of its
orthopaedic business to the Company. On August 6, 2001,
Bristol-Myers Squibb distributed all of the shares of Company
common stock to Bristol-Myers Squibb stockholders in the form of
a dividend of one share of Company common stock, and the
associated preferred stock purchase right, for every
10 shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock (the
“Distribution”). In addition, the Company assumed all
obligations under a $600 million credit facility
established by the Company and its former parent with then
outstanding borrowings of $290 million. With additional
borrowings under the credit facility, the Company repaid amounts
due to its former parent of approximately $90 million, and
finally, the Company assumed an additional $22 million of
borrowings under the credit facility for separation costs. In
addition, the Company recognized certain liabilities and
obligations for pension, post-retirement, long-term disability
and U.S. sales agent benefits. Recognition of these
liabilities and obligations and other adjustments were reflected
in the remaining net investment in the Company by its former
parent of $14.1 million as of the Distribution and
subsequently reclassified to opening retained earnings. The
Distribution qualified as a tax-free

transaction under Section 355 and 368 (a) (1)
(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as more fully
described in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, which are included herein under Item 8.

In 2001, the Company incurred $70.0 million
($49.9 million net of taxes) in costs, fees and expenses
relating to the separation from Bristol-Myers Squibb and the
related distribution of Company common stock to Bristol-Myers
Squibb stockholders which was partially funded by additional
borrowings under the credit facility. The costs, fees and
expenses were primarily for retention bonuses,
legal separation matters, professional expenses and costs
of producing, printing, mailing and distributing the information
statement relating to the Distribution.

Except for separation costs and the ongoing
interest cost associated with debt assumed or incurred as
of the Distribution, the Company does not currently anticipate
that operating costs resulting from the separation from its
former parent will materially impact its cost structure as
reflected in its historical consolidated results.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
    Market Risk

MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to certain market risks as
part of its ongoing business operations, including risks from
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices that could impact its financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its
exposure to these and other market risks through regular
operating and financing activities, and on a limited basis,
through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative
financial instruments are used solely as risk management tools
and not for speculative investment

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

The Company operates on a global basis and is
exposed to the risk that its financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes
in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company is primarily
exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to
its transactions and net assets denominated in Swiss Francs,
Japanese Yen, Euro, Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars. The
Company manages the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a
combined basis, which allows the Company to net exposures and to
take advantage of any natural offsets. In order to reduce the
uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions
denominated in foreign currencies, the Company enters into
derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange
forward contracts with major international financial
institutions. These forward contracts are designed to hedge
anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily
intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods
consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and
losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are
temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then
recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings.

The notional amounts of outstanding foreign
exchange forward contracts, principally Japanese Yen, Euro,
Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars, entered into with third
parties, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, were
$506 million and $252 million, respectively. For all
contracts outstanding at December 31, 2003, the Company has
an obligation to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Japanese
Yen, Euro, Canadian Dollars and Australian Dollars at set
maturity dates ranging from January 2004 through December 2005.
The weighted average contract rates for 2004 and 2005 are
Yen:USD 116 and 115, USD:Euro 1.06 and 1.11, Canadian
Dollar:USD 1.41 and 1.43 and USD:Australian Dollar 0.64 and
0.62, respectively.

The Company maintains written policies and
procedures governing its risk management activities. The
Company’s policy requires that critical terms of hedging
instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions. On
this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges, changes in cash
flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected
to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge
instruments. As part of its risk management program, the Company
furthermore performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential
changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and financial
position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange
rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of
foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at
December 31, 2003, indicated that, if the U.S. Dollar
uniformly changed in value by 10 percent relative to the
Japanese Yen, Euro, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar, with
no change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those
contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income
taxes, depending on the direction of the change, by an average
approximate amount of $25.2 million, $21.9 million,
$4.9 million and $4.9 million for the Yen, Euro,
Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar contracts, respectively.
Any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward
contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange
rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value
of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign exchange
contracts would not subject the Company to material risk due to
exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these
contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities,
and transactions being hedged.

The Company had net investment exposures to net
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of
approximately $1,775 million and $135 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily in
Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and Euro. Approximately
$1,333 million of the net asset exposure at
December 31, 2003 relates to goodwill and intangible assets
recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments as a
result of the Exchange Offers.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

The Company purchases raw material commodities
such as cobalt chrome, titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile
packaging. The Company enters into 12 to 24 month supply
contracts, where available, on these commodities to alleviate
the impact of market fluctuation in prices. As part of the
Company’s risk management program, sensitivity analyses
related to potential commodity price changes are performed. A
10 percent price change across all these commodities would
not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

INTEREST RATE RISK

In the normal course of business, the Company is
exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could
impact its results of operations and financial condition. The
Company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its
regular operations and financing activities.

Presently, the Company invests its cash and
equivalents in money market and investment-grade short-term debt
instruments. The primary investment objective is to ensure
capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting
default and market risk. Currently, the Company does not use
derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio.

The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk
arises principally from the short-term rates associated with its
credit facilities. The Company is subject to interest rate risk
through movements in interest rates on the committed Senior
Credit Facility and its uncommitted credit facilities.
Presently, all of its debt outstanding bears interest at
short-term rates. The Company currently does not hedge its
interest rate exposure, but may do so in the future. Based upon
the Company’s overall interest rate exposure as of
December 31, 2003, a change of 10 percent in interest
rates (or 23 basis points), assuming the amount outstanding
remains constant, would result in an annual increase of interest
expense of approximately $2.5 million. However, due to the
uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their
possible effects, this analysis assumes no such action, nor
management actions to mitigate interest rate changes. Further,
this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the
level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an
environment. Presently, the Company intends to utilize cash flow
to reduce outstanding borrowings.

CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments, which potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are primarily
cash, cash equivalents, counterparty transactions, and accounts
receivable.

The Company places its investments in highly
rated financial institutions and money market instruments, and
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. The
Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit
risk on its cash and equivalents and investments.

The Company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by the financial institutions with which
it conducts business. However, this loss is limited to the
amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to
the financial instrument contract exceed the obligation of the
Company. The Company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by
dealing with a diversified group of major financial
institutions. Credit risk is managed through the monitoring of
counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard
credit guidelines. The Company does not anticipate any
nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to
trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of
customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic
areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the
customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of
business. However, essentially all of the Company’s trade
receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital
and healthcare industry in the U.S. and internationally or with
distributors or dealers who operate in international markets
and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business,
economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent
upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the
respective countries’ national economic and health care
systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit
approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures and the
Company believes that reserves for losses are adequate. There is
no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or
other major concentration of credit risk.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of
Presentation

– The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zimmer
Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries in which it holds a
controlling equity position. Investments in companies in which
the Company exercises significant influence over the operating
and financial affairs, but does not control, are accounted for
under the equity method. Under the equity method, the Company
records the investment at cost and adjusts the carrying amount
of the investment by its proportionate share of the
investee’s net earnings or losses. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. The
consolidated financial statements represent the Company’s
operations as a public company commencing on August 6,
2001, combined with the operations of Zimmer as a division of
its former parent prior to becoming a public company. For
periods prior to August 6, 2001, intercompany accounts with
its former parent, other than specific outstanding obligations,
were combined with invested capital and reported in the
consolidated financial statements as net investment by former
parent. Certain amounts in the 2002 and 2001 consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
2003 presentation.

Use of
Estimates

– The consolidated
financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and,
accordingly, include amounts that are based on management’s
best estimates and judgments. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Foreign Currency
Translation

– The financial
statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange
rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for
operating results. Unrealized translation gains and losses are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses included in net earnings are not material.

Revenue
Recognition

– The Company
sells product through two principal channels: 1) direct to
health care institutions and 2) through stocking
distributors and healthcare dealers. The direct channel accounts
for greater than 80 percent of the Company’s revenue.
Through this channel, inventory is generally consigned to sales
agents or customers so that products are available when needed
for surgical procedures. No revenue is recognized upon the
placement of inventory into consignment as the Company retains
title and maintains the inventory on the Company’s balance
sheet. Upon use, the Company issues an invoice and revenue
is recognized. Pricing for products is generally predetermined
by contracts with customers, agents acting on behalf of
customer groups or by government regulatory bodies, depending on
the market. Price discounts under group purchasing contracts are
generally linked to volume of implant purchases by customer
health care institutions within a specified group. At negotiated
thresholds within a contract buying period, price discounts
increase. The Company tracks sales volumes by contract and as
contractual volume thresholds are achieved, the higher discounts
are applied at an item level on customer invoices. As such,
discounts are reflected in revenue as earned. The Company also
accrues for anticipated price adjustments, which can occur
subsequent to invoicing, based on reasonable estimates derived
from past experience. Revenue is recognized on sales to stocking
distributors and healthcare dealers, which account for less than
20 percent of the Company’s revenue, when title to
product passes to the distributor or healthcare dealer,
generally upon shipment. Product is generally sold to
distributors on secured credit terms at fixed prices for
specified periods. A distributor may return product in the event
that the Company terminates the relationship. Under those
circumstances, the Company records an estimated sales return in
the period in which notice of termination is given to a
distributor.

The reserves for doubtful accounts were
$10.0 million and $7.2 million as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Provisions charged to bad debt
expense were $2.6 million and $1.1 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Amounts written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts
were $1.5 million and $0.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Cash and
Equivalents

– The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and
equivalents are valued at cost, which approximates their fair
value. The

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

Company has restricted cash primarily composed of
cash held in escrow related to certain insurance coverage.

Inventories

–
Inventories, net of allowances for obsolete and slow-moving
goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
determined on the basis of average costing.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

– Property, plant
and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed based on the estimated useful lives of
ten to forty years for buildings and improvements, three to
eight years for machinery and equipment and generally five years
for instruments using the straight-line method. Maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred. In accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” the Company reviews property, plant and
equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
estimated future undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset
are less than its carrying amount.

Goodwill

–
The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”. SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial
recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired
outside a business combination and the recognition and
measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent
to acquisition. Under SFAS 142, goodwill is not amortized
but is subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill has been
assigned to each of the Company’s reportable operating
segments. The Company will perform annual impairment tests in
accordance with SFAS No. 142. The fair value of each
reportable operating segment will be compared to its carrying
amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential
impairment. If the implied fair value of the reportable
operating segment is less than its carrying value, an impairment
loss will be recorded to the extent that the fair value of the
goodwill within the reportable operating segment is less than
the carrying value. The fair value of the goodwill will be
determined based upon discounted cash flows, market multiples or
appraised values as appropriate.

Intangible
Assets

– The Company
accounts for intangible assets in accordance with
SFAS No. 142. Intangible assets with an indefinite
life, including certain trademarks and trade names, are not
amortized. The useful life of indefinite life intangible assets
will be assessed annually to determine whether events and
circumstances continue to support an indefinite life. Intangible
assets with a finite life, including core and developed
technology, certain trademarks and trade names, customer related
intangibles and patents and licenses are amortized over their
estimated useful life, ranging from seven to thirty years.
Intangible assets with a finite life will be tested for
impairment annually, or whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying amount
exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. The amount of the
impairment loss to be recorded would be calculated by the excess
of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value.

Research and
Development

– The Company
expenses all research and development costs as incurred.
Research and development costs include salaries, prototypes,
depreciation of equipment used in research and development,
consultant fees and amounts paid to collaborative partners.

Income
Taxes

– The Company accounts
for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates in
effect for the years in which the differences are expected to
reverse. Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the
income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted
to the U.S.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

– The Company
accounts for all derivative financial instruments in accordance
with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” which requires that
all derivative instruments be reported as assets or liabilities
on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. The Company
maintains written policies and procedures that permit, under
appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization,
the use of derivative financial instruments solely for hedging
purposes. The use of derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes is prohibited. The Company
utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effect
of exchange rate fluctuations on anticipated foreign currency
transactions, primarily intercompany sales and purchases
expected to occur within the next twelve to twenty-four months.
Derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are
designated as such from inception. Formal documentation is
maintained of the Company’s objectives, the nature of the
risk being hedged, identification of the instrument, the hedged
transaction, the hedging relationship and how effectiveness of
the hedging instrument will be assessed. The Company’s
policy requires that critical terms of a hedging instrument are
essentially the same as a hedged forecasted transaction. On this
basis, with respect to a cash flow hedge, changes in cash flows
attributable to the hedged transaction are generally expected to
be completely offset by the cash flows attributable to hedge
instruments. The Company, therefore, performs quarterly
assessments of hedge effectiveness by verifying and documenting
those critical terms of the hedge instrument and forecasted
transactions have not changed. The Company also assesses on a
quarterly basis whether there have been adverse developments
regarding the risk of a counterparty default. For derivatives
which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective
portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in
other comprehensive income and then recognized in earnings when
the hedged item affects net income.

The ineffective portion of a
derivative’s change in fair value, if any, is reported
in net earnings.

Stock
Compensation

– At
December 31, 2003, the Company has three stock-based
employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note 16. The Company accounts for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related Interpretations. No stock based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all
options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to
the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net
earnings and earnings per share if the Company had applied
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,” to the
above plans.

Comprehensive
Income

– Other comprehensive
income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are included in
comprehensive income but are excluded from net earnings
as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to
stockholders’ equity. The Company’s other
comprehensive income is comprised of unrealized foreign currency
hedge gains and losses, net of tax, minimum pension liability
adjustments, net of tax, and foreign currency translation
adjustments.

The components of accumulated other comprehensive
income at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, are as follows
(in millions):

Accounting
Pronouncements

– Effective
January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” and SFAS No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,”
without any material impact on its financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

In 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under
SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The
Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 149
without any material impact on its financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

In 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.”
SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer
classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments
entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise
is effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company has adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 150 without any material impact
on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In 2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132,
“Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits”. The revised
SFAS No. 132 retains the disclosure requirements of
the original SFAS No. 132 and adds additional
disclosure requirements regarding assets, obligations, cash
flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension
plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. The
revised SFAS No. 132 is effective for fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2003 for certain disclosures with
the remaining disclosures effective for fiscal years ending
after June 15, 2004. The Company adopted revised
SFAS No. 132 on December 31, 2003.

In 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
(“FIN”) No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”. FIN 45 requires
a guarantor to recognize a liability, at the inception of the
guarantee, for the fair value of obligations it has
undertaken in issuing the guarantee and also requires more
detailed disclosures with respect to guarantees. FIN 45 is
effective for guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002 and requires additional disclosures for
existing guarantees. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”,
and subsequent revision, FIN No. 46R “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities”. FIN 46R defines a
variable interest entity (“VIE”) as a corporation,
partnership, trust, or any other legal structure that does not
have equity investors with a controlling financial interest or
has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial
resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R
requires consolidation of a VIE by the primary beneficiary

of the assets, liabilities, and results of
activities. FIN 46R also requires certain disclosures by
all holders of a significant variable interest in a VIE that are
not the primary beneficiary. The Company does not have any
material investments in variable interest entities; therefore,
the adoption of this interpretation has not and is not expected
to have a material effect on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position No. 106-1 (“FSP”) which allows companies
to defer accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription
Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the
“Act”) on its accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (“APBO”) and its net postretirement benefit
costs. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare Part D as well as a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. Due to uncertainties regarding the implementation
of the Act, the Company is unable to determine the impact of the
subsidy on our APBO and net postretirement benefit costs
included in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly,
the Company has elected to defer accounting for the subsidy in
accordance with the FSP. Specific authoritative guidance on
accounting for the subsidy is pending and, when issued, could
require the Company to change previously reported information
depending upon the transition guidance ultimately approved by
the FASB.

ACQUISITIONS

Centerpulse AG and InCentive Capital
AG

On October 2, 2003 (the “Closing
Date”), the Company closed its exchange offer for
Centerpulse AG (“Centerpulse”), a global
orthopaedic medical device company headquartered in Switzerland
that services the reconstructive joint, spine and dental implant
markets. The Company also closed its exchange offer for
InCentive Capital AG (“InCentive”), a company
that, at the Closing Date, owned only cash and beneficially
owned 18.3 percent of the issued Centerpulse shares. The
primary reason for making the Centerpulse and InCentive exchange
offers (the “Exchange Offers”) was to create a global
leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of
orthopaedic reconstructive implants, including joint and dental,
spine implants, and trauma products. The strategic compatibility
of the products and technologies of the Company and Centerpulse
is expected to provide significant earnings power and a strong
platform from which it can actively pursue growth opportunities
in the industry. For the Company, Centerpulse provides a unique
platform for growth and diversification in Europe as well as in
the spine and dental segments of the medical device industry. As
a result of the Exchange Offers, the Company beneficially owns
98.7 percent of the issued Centerpulse shares (including
the Centerpulse shares owned by InCentive) and 99.9 percent
of the issued InCentive shares. Pursuant to Swiss law, the
Company has initiated the compulsory acquisition process to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of Centerpulse and
InCentive that it does not already own, and expects to complete
this process in April of 2004.

The Exchange Offers were accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting pursuant to
SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”.
Accordingly, Centerpulse and InCentive results of operations
have been included in the Company’s consolidated results of
operations subsequent to the Closing Date, and their respective
assets and liabilities have been recorded at their estimated
fair values in the Company’s consolidated statement of
financial position as of the Closing Date, with the excess
purchase price being allocated to goodwill.

The aggregate consideration paid by the Company
in the Exchange Offers was $3,453.4 million, consisting of
Company common stock valued at $2,223.8 million
(44,538,770 shares exchanged), $1,187.1 million of
cash and $42.5 million of direct acquisition costs. In
accordance with EITF 99-12, “Determination of the
Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities
Issued in a Purchase Business Combination”, the fair value
of the Company’s common stock issued pursuant to the
Exchange Offers was determined to be $49.93 per share based
upon the average closing price of the Company’s common
stock two days before and after the date when sufficient
Centerpulse and InCentive shares had been tendered to make the
Exchange Offers binding (August 27, 2003).

The Company completed the preliminary purchase
price allocation in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. The process included interviews
with Centerpulse management, review of the economic and
competitive environment in which Centerpulse operates
and examination of assets including historical performance
and future prospects.

The purchase price allocation was based on
information currently available to the Company, and expectations
and assumptions deemed reasonable by the Company’s
management. No assurance can be given, however, that the
underlying assumptions used to estimate expected technology
based product revenues, development costs or profitability, or
the events associated with such technology, will occur as
projected. Certain other fair value estimates require additional
information before being finalized, including estimates of
rights and contingent obligations pertaining to divested
businesses, certain intellectual property and other matters,
investments, and inventory and instruments associated with
brands that the Company intends to discontinue. For these
reasons, among others, the actual results may vary from the
projected results. The final valuation and associated purchase
price allocation is expected to be completed as soon as
possible, but no later than one year from the Closing Date. To
the extent that the estimates need to be adjusted, the Company
will do so.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
Closing Date.

As of the Closing Date, the Company recorded a
$75.7 million integration liability consisting of
$49.7 million of employee termination benefits,
$22.6 million of sales agent and lease contract termination
costs and $3.4 million of employee relocation costs. In
accordance with EITF 95-3 “Recognition of Liabilities
Assumed in a Purchase Business Combination”, these
liabilities have been included in the allocation of the purchase
price. The Company’s integration plan covers all functional
business areas, including sales force, research and development,
manufacturing and administrative. Approximately
800 Centerpulse employees will be involuntarily
terminated through the Company’s integration plan. The
Company expects to phase-out production at its Austin, Texas
manufacturing facility beginning in August 2004. The phase-out
will result in the involuntary termination of approximately
550 employees, including 340 employees involved in
manufacturing. Products previously manufactured at the Austin
facility will be sourced from the Company’s other
manufacturing facilities. The Company expects to hire additional
manufacturing employees at its other manufacturing facilities to
handle increased production schedules. The phase-out is expected
to be completed by the end of 2005. As of December 31,
2003, approximately forty Centerpulse employees had been
involuntarily terminated. The Company’s integration plan is
expected to be completed by the end of 2005. Reconciliation of
the integration liability, as of December 31, 2003,
is as follow (in millions):

The $11.2 million assigned to in-process
research and development was written off as of the Closing Date
in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4,
“Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business
Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method”. The
fair value of acquired in-process research and development was
determined in accordance with the AICPA practice aid entitled
“Assets Acquired in a Purchase Business Combination to be
used in Research and Development Activities”.

Goodwill of $1,263.6 million,
$836.3 million and $104.8 million was assigned to the
Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments,
respectively. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes. See Note 7 for more information related
to goodwill and acquired intangible assets.

The following sets forth unaudited pro forma
financial information (i) derived from the financial
statements of the Company for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 and (ii) derived from the financial
statements of Centerpulse for the year ended December 31,
2002 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2003.
The unaudited pro forma financial information is based on the
financial statements of the Company and the financial statements
of Centerpulse and has been adjusted to give effect to the
Exchange Offers as if they had occurred on January 1 of the
respective years:

These unaudited pro forma results have been
prepared for comparative purposes only and include adjustments
such as amortization of acquired intangible assets and interest
expense on debt incurred to finance the Exchange Offers. The
unaudited pro forma results for 2003 exclude $11.2 million
of in-process research and development write-offs,
$170.0 million ($121.3 million net of tax) of
investment banking fees, legal and accounting fees, break-up
fee, compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of
certain Centerpulse stock options, distributor terminations,
integration related consulting and professional fees, severance
and other acquisition and integration related expenses, and
inventory step-up of $95.3 million ($62.1 million net
of tax).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

The unaudited pro forma results for 2003 include
$90.4 million of expense related to Centerpulse hip and
knee litigation, $54.4 million of cash income tax benefits
as a result of Centerpulse electing to carry back its 2002
U.S. federal net operating loss for 5 years versus
10 years, which resulted in more losses being carried
forward to future years and less tax credits going unutilized
due to the shorter carry back period and an $8.0 million
gain on sale of Orquest Inc., an investment previously held by
Centerpulse. The unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily
indicative either of the results of operations that actually
would have resulted had the Exchange Offers been in effect at
the beginning of the respective years or of future results.

TransFx

On June 25, 2003, the Company acquired the

TransFx

External Fixation System product line from
Immedica, Inc. for approximately $14.8 million cash,
which has been allocated primarily to goodwill and technology
based intangible assets. The Company has sold the

TransFx

product line since early 2001 under a distribution agreement
with Immedica.

Implex Corp.

On March 2, 2004, the Company entered into
an Amended and Restated Merger Agreement relating to the
acquisition of Implex Corp. (“Implex”), a privately
held orthopaedics company based in New Jersey, for cash. Each
share of Implex stock will be converted into the right to
receive cash having an aggregate value of approximately
$108.0 million at closing and additional cash earn-out
payments that are contingent on the growth of Implex product
sales through 2006. The net value transferred at closing will be
approximately $89 million, which includes adjustments for
debt repayment, certain payments previously made by Zimmer to
Implex pursuant to their existing alliance arrangement, escrow
and other items. The acquisition will be accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting.

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

Instruments are hand held devices used by
orthopaedic surgeons during total joint replacement and other
surgical procedures. Effective January 1, 2003, instruments
are recognized as long-lived assets and are included in
property, plant and equipment. Undeployed instruments are
carried at cost, net of allowances for obsolescence. Instruments
in the field are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
average estimated useful lives, determined principally in
reference to associated product life cycles, primarily five
years. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Company
reviews instruments for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may
not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
estimated future cash flows relating to the asset are less than
its carrying amount. Depreciation of instruments is recognized
as selling, general and administrative expense, consistent with
the classification of instrument cost in periods prior to
January 1, 2003.

Prior to January 1, 2003, undeployed
instruments were carried as a prepaid expense at cost, net of
allowances for obsolescence ($54.8 million, net, at
December 31, 2002), and recognized in selling, general and
administrative expense in the year in which the instruments were
placed into service. The new method of accounting for
instruments was adopted to recognize the cost of these important
assets of the Company’s business within the consolidated
balance sheet and meaningfully allocate the cost of these assets
over the periods benefited, typically five years.

The effect of the change during the year ended
December 31, 2003 was to increase earnings before
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle by
$26.8 million ($17.8 million net of tax), or
$0.08 per diluted share. The cumulative effect adjustment
of $55.1 million (net of income taxes of
$34.0 million) to retroactively apply the new
capitalization method as if applied in years prior to 2003 is
included in earnings during the year ended December 31,
2003. The pro forma amounts shown on the consolidated statement
of earnings have been adjusted for the effect of the retroactive
application on depreciation and related income taxes.

5.

INVENTORIES

Inventories at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
consist of the following (in millions):

Reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory
at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $47.4 million and
$45.5 million, respectively. Provisions charged to expense
were $11.6 million, $6.0 million and
$11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. Amounts written off against the
reserve were $11.7 million, $7.1 million and
$8.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

Following the acquisition of Centerpulse, the
Company established a common approach for estimating excess
inventory and instruments. This change in estimate resulted in a
charge to earnings of $3.0 million after tax in the fourth
quarter.

The components of identifiable intangible assets
are as follows (in millions):

Total amortization expense for finite-lived
intangible assets was $10.9 million in 2003 and was
recorded as part of selling, general and administrative.
Intangible assets and related amortization expense for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were not significant.

The weighted average amortization lives for core
technology, developed technology, trademarks and trade names,
and customer relationships are nineteen years, fourteen years,
eleven years and thirty years, respectively. The weighted
average amortization life of these intangible assets on a
combined basis is sixteen years.

Estimated annual amortization expense for the
years ended December 31, 2004 through 2008 is
$33.9 million, $33.8 million, $33.7 million,
$33.5 million and $33.5 million, respectively.

OTHER ASSETS

Other Assets at December 31, 2003 include
$34.7 million of investments in non-consolidated companies
and $43.9 million of sundry assets. As of December 31,
2003, the only significant investment was an approximate
34 percent investment in Tutogen Medical, Inc.
(“Tutogen”), a publicly traded medical device company
based in New Jersey (AMEX:TTG). The Company accounts for this
investment under the equity method of accounting. The carrying
amount of Tutogen at December 31, 2003, was
$27.2 million. The fair value of this investment based upon
the closing market price on December 31, 2003 was
$23.9 million. Earnings recognized under the equity method
for the year ended December 31, 2003 were not significant.
The Company did not have any significant investments in
non-consolidated companies at December 31, 2002.

$43.5 million, respectively, of deferred distributor
commissions and $128.9 million of non-current tax
liabilities at December 31, 2003. The value of deferred
commissions is determined by contracts based upon sales growth.
Deferred commissions are recorded as a selling expense in
the same period that associated product revenue is recognized.

DEBT

Senior Credit Facility

In connection with the Exchange Offers, the
Company entered into the following committed financing
arrangements: (i) $400 million 364-day revolving
credit facility, (ii) $800 million three-year
revolving credit facility and (iii) $550 million
five-year term loan facility, (collectively, the “Senior
Credit Facility”). The Company’s Senior Credit
Facility was used to fund the cash portion of the Exchange
Offers, refinance the existing debt of both the Company and
Centerpulse and pay certain closing costs. Effective as of the
Closing Date, the Company terminated its $600 million
committed, multi-currency revolving senior credit facility (the
“Terminated Facility”).

Debt issuance costs of $19.9 million were
incurred to obtain the Senior Credit Facility arrangement. These
costs were capitalized and are amortized to earnings on a
straight-line basis over the lives of the related facilities. At
December 31, 2003, unamortized debt issuance costs were
$16.8 million.

Upon maturity of the Senior Credit
Facility’s $400 million 364-day revolving credit
facility in June 2004, the Company is permitted to convert the
outstanding balance to a term loan repayable in a single payment
due in June 2005. The lenders’ commitments under the Senior
Credit Facility’s $800 million three-year revolving
credit facility expire in June 2006. The Senior Credit
Facility’s $550 million five-year term loan facility
amortizes in quarterly installments beginning in September 2005.
There is no prepayment penalty included in the Senior Credit
Facility. The $800 million three-year revolving credit
facility has a multi-currency option of up to an aggregate
principal amount of $350 million.

The Company and certain of its wholly owned
foreign and domestic subsidiaries are the borrowers and its
wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are the guarantors of the
Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings may bear interest at the
appropriate LIBOR-based rate, or an alternative base rate, plus
an applicable margin determined by reference to the
Company’s senior unsecured long-term credit rating and the
amounts drawn under the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior
Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative
covenants and events of default for an unsecured financing
arrangement. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage
ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit
Facility as of December 31, 2003. Commitments under the
$400 million 364-day revolving credit facility and the
$800 million three-year revolving credit facility are
subject to certain fees, including a facility and a utilization
fee.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
$1,102.4 million in outstanding borrowings under the Senior
Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2003, the Senior Credit
Facility borrowings were comprised of $1,000.0 million in
U.S. dollar based borrowings with a weighted average
interest rate of 2.26 percent (3.42 percent as of
December 31, 2002 under the Terminated Facility) and the
equivalent of $102.4 million in Japanese Yen based
borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of
0.84 percent (0.93 percent as of December 31,
2002 under the Terminated Facility).

Uncommitted Credit Facilities

The Company has a $15 million uncommitted
unsecured revolving line of credit. The purpose of this credit
line is to support the working capital needs, letters of credit
and overdraft needs for the Company. The uncommitted credit
agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants
and events of default, none of which are considered restrictive
to the operation of the business. In addition, this uncommitted
credit agreement provides for unconditional and irrevocable
guarantees by the Company. In the event the Company’s
long-term debt ratings by both Standard and Poor’s Ratings
Services and Moody’s Investor’s Service, Inc.,
fall below BB- and Ba3, then the Company may be required to
repay all outstanding and contingent obligations. The
Company’s credit rating as of December 31, 2003 met
such requirement. This uncommitted credit line matures on
August 1, 2004. Outstanding borrowings under this
uncommitted line of credit as of December 31, 2003 and 2002
were $0.6 million and zero, respectively.

The Company has an additional $20 million
uncommitted unsecured revolving line of credit. The purpose of
this credit line is to support short-term working capital needs
of the Company. The agreement for this uncommitted unsecured
line of credit contains customary covenants, none of which are
considered restrictive to the operation of the business. This
uncommitted line matures on July 28, 2004. There were no
borrowings under this uncommitted line of credit as of
December 31, 2003 or 2002.

The Company was in compliance with all covenants
under both uncommitted credit facilities as of December 31,
2003.

Outstanding debt as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, consists of the following (in millions):

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to market risk due to
changes in currency exchange rates. As a result, the Company
utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effect
of exchange rate fluctuations on anticipated foreign currency
transactions, primarily intercompany sales and purchases
expected to occur within the next twelve to twenty-four months.
The Company does not hold financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes. For derivatives which qualify as hedges of
future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair
value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income,
then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects
earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative’s change
in fair value, if any, is reported in earnings. The net amount
recognized in earnings during the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, due to ineffectiveness and amounts excluded
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, was not significant.

The notional amounts of outstanding foreign
exchange forward contracts, principally Japanese Yen, Euro,
Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar, entered into with third
parties, at December 31, 2003, was $506 million. The
fair value of outstanding derivative instruments recorded on the
balance sheet at December 31, 2003, together with settled
derivatives where the hedged item has not yet affected earnings,
was a net unrealized loss of $65.0 million, or
$40.4 million net of taxes, and is deferred in other
comprehensive income and is expected to be reclassified to
earnings over the next two years, of which, $27.5 million,
or $17.0 million, net of taxes, is expected to be
reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months.

RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has defined benefit pension plans
covering substantially all U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. Plan
benefits are primarily based on years of credited service and
the participant’s compensation. In addition to the U.S. and
Puerto Rico defined benefit pension plans, the Company sponsors
various non-U.S. pension arrangements, including retirement
and termination benefit plans required by local law or
coordinated with government sponsored plans. As a result of the
consummation of the Exchange Offers, the Company acquired the
obligations and assets of certain Centerpulse defined benefit
plans as of the Closing Date.

The Company also provides comprehensive medical
and group life insurance benefits to substantially all U.S. and
Puerto Rico retirees who elect to participate in the
Company’s comprehensive medical and group life plans. The
medical plan is contributory, and the life insurance plan is
non-contributory. No similar plans exist for employees outside
the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

In both the U.S. and jurisdictions outside of the
U.S., the Company has adopted employee benefit plans that are
comparable to those of its former parent. In general, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, eligibility
for benefits, benefit forms and vesting under Company plans,
each active employee is credited with his or her service with
the former parent to the extent the corresponding plans of the
former parent gave credit for such service.

In connection with the Distribution, the Company
and its former parent entered into an Employee Benefits
Agreement which allocated responsibilities relating to employee
compensation, benefit plans and programs and other related
matters. Under the agreement, as of a specified date, active
employees of the Company ceased to be active participants in
benefit plans maintained by the former parent and became
eligible to participate in all applicable Company plans.

The agreement provides that, as of the
Distribution (as defined in Note 18), the Company assumed,
retained and is liable for all wages, salaries, welfare,
incentive compensation and other employee-related obligations
and liabilities for all current and former employees of the
Company, except as specifically provided otherwise. The former
parent retained certain obligations for domestic pension
benefits for services rendered through the Distribution. The
former parent also retained obligations for medical and group
life insurance benefits for all domestic retirees and those
employees eligible to retire as of the Distribution.
Substantially all assets funding its pension and postretirement
benefit plans were retained by the former parent as of the
Distribution Date.

The Company uses a December 31 measurement
date for the majority of its benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation for U.S. and
Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement pension plans was
$35.1 million and $22.2 million as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The accumulated
benefit obligation for non-U.S. defined benefit retirement
plans was $115.6 million and $15.0 million as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company’s weighted-average asset
allocations for the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit
retirement plans at December 31, 2003 and 2002, by
asset category are as follows:

The U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit
retirement plans’ overall investment strategy is to
maximize total returns by emphasizing long-term growth of
principal while avoiding excessive risk. The Company has
established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 50
to 75 percent for equity securities and 30 to
50 percent for debt securities. The plans strive to have
sufficiently diversified assets so that adverse
or unexpected results from one asset class will not have an
unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. The
investments in the plans are rebalanced quarterly.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
Company’s pension plans’ assets did not hold any
direct investment in the Company’s common stock.

The Company estimates that its minimum funding
requirements by law for the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit
retirement plans to not be significant. However, the Company
expects to voluntarily contribute between $10 million to
$15 million to these plans during 2004.

The Company also sponsors defined contribution
plans for substantially all of the U.S. and Puerto Rico
employees and employees in other countries. The benefits of
these plans relate to local customs and practices in the
countries concerned. The Company contributed $4.8 million,
$3.5 million and $3.0 million of expense to these
plans for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

The components of net periodic expense for the
year ended December 31 for the Company’s
postretirement benefit plans subsequent to the Distribution are
as follows (in millions):

The weighted average actuarial assumptions used
in accounting for the Company’s postretirement benefit
plans were as follows:

Changes in benefit obligations, from the
Distribution to December 31, 2003 for the Company’s
postretirement benefit plans, were (in millions):

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
Company had no assets in its postretirement benefit plans.

A one percentage point change in the assumed
health care cost trend rates would have no significant effect on
the service and interest cost components of net postretirement
benefit expense and the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation. The effect of a change in the healthcare cost trend
rate is tempered by a cap that limits medical costs to be
paid by the Company.

Included in the consolidated statement of
earnings for the year ended December 31, 2001 is an
allocation of $6.0 million from the Company’s former
parent for expenses specifically attributable to the
Company’s employees’ participation in its retirement
and postretirement benefit plans for periods prior to the
Distribution.

INCOME TAXES

The components of earnings before taxes consist
of the following (in millions):


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

The provision for income taxes consists of (in
millions):

For periods prior to the Distribution, the income
tax provision was calculated on a separate return basis while
actual tax payments were made on a combined return basis by the
Company’s former parent. Income taxes paid by the Company
during 2003, 2002 and 2001 (for the period after the
Distribution) were $116.1 million, $114.2 million and
$43.4 million, respectively.

A reconciliation of the U.S. statutory
income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as
follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes.

The components of deferred income taxes consisted
of the following (in millions):

The significant changes in the deferred tax
assets primarily relate to the acquisition of Centerpulse.

At December 31, 2003, approximately
$336.6 million of federal, state and foreign tax effected
losses and $8.2 million of federal credits were available
for carryover. The state losses and federal credits are subject
to valuation allowances and certain restrictions. The losses and
credits generally expire within a period of 1 to 19 years.
At December 31, 2003, $11.5 million of tax effected
capital losses were available for carryover. The carryover is
subject to a valuation allowance and expires in 2005 and 2006.

The Company’s former parent received a
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), that
the Distribution would qualify as a tax-free transaction. Such a
ruling, while generally binding upon the IRS, is subject to
certain factual representations and assumptions. The Company has
agreed to certain restrictions on its future actions to provide
further assurances that the Distribution will qualify as
tax-free. If the Company fails to abide by such restrictions
and, as a result, the Distribution fails to qualify as a
tax-free transaction, the Company will be obligated to indemnify
its former parent for any resulting tax liability.

Under the Tax Sharing Agreement (the
“Agreement”) executed in conjunction with the
Distribution, the Company’s former parent retains control
and discretion with regard to any federal, foreign, combined,
consolidated and certain separate state tax filings or tax
audits for periods through the Distribution and retains all
refunds for such periods. The Agreement was amended to clarify
the Company is responsible for 25 percent of tax audit
assessments in foreign jurisdictions for periods prior to the
Distribution up to a cumulative maximum of $5 million.

The Company has a long-term liability of
$128.9 million at December 31, 2003 for expected
settlement of various U.S. and foreign income tax liabilities.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had an
aggregate of approximately $145 million of unremitted
earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have been, or are intended
to be, permanently reinvested for continued use in foreign
operations. If the total undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries were remitted, a significant amount of the
additional tax would be offset by the allowable foreign tax
credits. It is impractical for the Company to determine the
additional tax of remitting these earnings.

15.

CAPITAL STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

As discussed in Note 18, 193.6 million
shares of Company common stock were distributed at the
Distribution by the former parent to its stockholders in the
form of a dividend of one share of Company common stock, and the
associated preferred stock purchase right, for every ten shares
of common stock of the former parent. In July 2001 the board of
directors of the Company adopted a rights agreement intended to
have anti-takeover effects. Under this agreement one right
attaches to each share of Company common stock. The rights will
not become exercisable until the earlier of: a) the Company
learns that a person or group acquired, or obtained the right to
acquire, beneficial ownership of securities representing more
than 20 percent of the shares of Company common stock
then outstanding, or


ZIMMER HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

2003 FORM 10-K

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

b) such date, if any, as may be designated
by the board of directors following the commencement of, or
first public disclosure of an intention to commence, a tender
offer or exchange offer for shares of Company common stock then
outstanding that could result in a person or group acquiring, or
obtaining the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of
securities representing more than 20 percent of Company
common stock then outstanding.

The board of directors authorized for issuance
2 million shares of a series of preferred stock of the
Company designated as Series A Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) in
connection with the adoption of the rights agreement. Shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock are only issuable upon the
exercise of the rights. No shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock have been issued as of December 31, 2003.

The board of directors may redeem all of the
rights at a redemption price of $0.01 per right. If
not previously exercised or redeemed, the rights will expire
10 years from the date that the rights agreement commenced.

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings
per share is net earnings available to common stockholders. The
denominator for basic earnings per share is the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. The
denominator for diluted earnings per share is weighted average
shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock
options. The following is a reconciliation of weighted average
shares for the basic and diluted share computations (in
millions):

16.

STOCK OPTION AND COMPENSATION PLANS

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
three stock option plans in effect, the 2001 Stock Incentive
Plan, the TeamShare Stock Option Plan and the Stock Plan for
Non-Employee Directors. The Company has reserved the maximum
number of shares of common stock available for award under the
terms of each of these plans and has registered
34.3 million shares of common stock. Options may be granted
under these plans at a price of not less than the fair market
value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. The 2001
Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified
stock options and incentive stock options, long-term performance
awards, restricted stock awards and deferred stock units.
Options granted under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan may include
stock appreciation rights. The TeamShare Stock Option Plan
provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options and, in
certain jurisdictions, stock appreciation rights, while the
Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides for awards of
stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to
non-employee directors.

Options granted under these plans generally vest
over three to five years, although in no event in less than one
year, and expire ten years from the date of grant. In the past,
certain options have had price thresholds, which affect
exercisability. All such price thresholds have been satisfied.

Under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, the total
number of awards which may be granted in a given year pursuant
to options and other awards under the plan may not exceed
1.9 percent of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
stock on the effective date of the Plan for 2001 or January 1 of
each subsequent year, plus the number of shares from the prior
year that were available for grant but not granted, that were
granted but subsequently terminated, expired, cancelled or
surrendered without being exercised or tendered in the prior
year to pay for options or satisfy tax withholding requirements.
No participant may receive options or awards which in the
aggregate exceed 2 million shares of stock over the life of
the Plan.

At the Distribution, certain options to purchase
Bristol-Myers Squibb stock that were held by Company employees
were converted to Company stock options under either the 2001
Stock Incentive Plan or the TeamShare Stock Option Plan. The
options were converted at quantities and exercise prices that
maintained the intrinsic value of the option as it existed
immediately prior to the Distribution. The vesting dates and
exercise periods of the options were not affected by the
conversion.

A summary of the status of all options granted to
employees and non-employee directors at December 31 and
changes during the period from the distribution date is
presented below:

(Continued)

The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding at December 31, 2003:

Options exercisable at December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, were 4.9 million, 4.7 million and
4.0 million, respectively, with average exercise prices of
$25.97, $22.81 and $19.85, respectively.

The fair value of each option granted is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

The weighted average fair value for options
granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $12.85, $10.63 and
$14.10, respectively.

See Note 2 for the effect on net earnings
and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock based
employee compensation.

Restricted Stock

At the Distribution, certain members of
management had restricted stock grants for Bristol-Myers Squibb
stock which were converted into Company restricted stock grants
at quantities and prices that maintained the intrinsic value
that existed immediately prior to the Distribution. Total
converted grants represented 106,560 shares at the
Distribution. Subsequent to the Distribution, restrictions on
7,430, 32,578 and 20,361 shares were eliminated in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. Restricted stock grants were made
for 50,200 and 33,681 shares in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. In addition, 9,902

restricted stock shares were forfeited in 2003.
The awards are being expensed over the vesting period of five
years from date of grant and the expense recorded by the Company
for all periods presented was not significant.

SEGMENT DATA

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and
markets reconstructive orthopaedic implants, including joint and
dental, spinal implants, and trauma products and orthopaedic
surgical products which include surgical supplies and
instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures.
Operations are managed through three major geographic
segments – the Americas, which is comprised
principally of the United States and includes other North,
Central and South American markets; Europe, which is comprised
principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and Africa;
and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan and
includes other Asian and Pacific markets. This structure is the
basis for the Company’s reportable segment information
discussed below. Company management evaluates operating segment
performance based upon segment operating profit exclusive of
operating expenses pertaining to global operations and
corporate expenses, acquisition and integration expenses,
inventory step-up, in-process research and development
write-offs and Separation Costs from the Company’s former
parent. Global operations include research, development
engineering, medical education, brand management, corporate
legal, finance, human resource functions, and operations and
logistics. Medical education expenses and cost of capital
charges had been previously reported within each respective
geographic segment. For each year presented below, medical
education expenses have been included in global operations and
cost of capital charges have been eliminated.

SEPARATION FROM BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB
    COMPANY

The Company was incorporated in Delaware as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb, its former
parent, on January 12, 2001. On July 25, 2001,
Bristol-Myers Squibb transferred the assets and liabilities of
its orthopaedic business to the Company. On August 6, 2001,
Bristol-Myers Squibb distributed all 193.6 million shares
of Company common stock to Bristol-Myers Squibb stockholders in
the form of a dividend of one share of Company common stock and
the associated preferred stock purchase right, for every
10 shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock (the
“Distribution”). The Distribution qualified as a
tax-free distribution made under Section 355 and
368(a)(1)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as more
fully-described in Note 14. On August 6, 2001,
the Company assumed all obligations under the Terminated
Facility established by the Company and its former parent
with then outstanding borrowings of $290 million. With
additional borrowings under the Terminated Facility, the Company
repaid amounts due to its former parent of approximately
$90 million, and finally, the Company assumed an additional
$22 million of borrowings under the Terminated Facility for
separation costs. The Company also recognized certain
liabilities and obligations for pension, post-retirement,
long-term disability and U.S. sales agent benefits.
Recognition of these liabilities and obligations reduced the net
investment in Zimmer by its former parent.

The Company incurred $70.0 million
($49.9 million net of taxes) in 2001 in costs, fees
and expenses relating to the separation from its former
parent and distribution of Company common stock to the
Bristol-Myers Squibb stockholders (“Separation
Costs”). These costs, fees and expenses were primarily for
retention bonuses; legal separation matters; professional
expenses; and costs of producing, printing, mailing and
distributing the information statement related to the
Distribution.

19.

TRANSACTIONS WITH FORMER PARENT

Prior to the Distribution, the former parent of
the Company provided certain services, including administration
of treasury, insurance, payroll, employee compensation and
benefits, travel and meeting services, public and investor
relations, real estate services, internal audit, corporate
aviation and related services, telecommunications, computing
services, corporate income tax and selected legal services.
Management of the Company believes that the methods used to
allocate expenses to the Company for these services were
reasonable, although it cannot be assured that all the expenses
that would have been incurred had the Company been a separate,
standalone entity have been reflected in financial results prior
to the Distribution. These services accounted for a total
expense of $17.2 million for the period January 1,
2001 through the Distribution.

LEASES

Future minimum rental commitments under
non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of

$5.4 million for 2007, $3.8 million for 2008 and
$12.7 million thereafter. Total rent expense for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 aggregated
$15.7 million, $9.1 million and $5.7 million,
respectively.

21.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

As a result of the Centerpulse transaction, on
the Closing Date the Company acquired the entity involved in
Centerpulse’s hip and knee implant litigation matter. The
litigation was a result of a voluntary recall of certain hip and
knee implants manufactured and sold by Centerpulse. On
March 13, 2002, a U.S. Class Action Settlement
Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) was entered into by
Centerpulse that resolved U.S. claims related to the
affected products and a settlement trust (“Settlement
Trust”) was established and funded for the most part by
Centerpulse. The court approved the settlement arrangement on
May 8, 2002. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement,
the Company will reimburse the Settlement Trust for each
revision surgery over 4,000 and revisions on reprocessed shells
over 64. As of February 20, 2004, the claims administrator
has received 4,122 likely valid claims for hips (cut-off
date June 5, 2003) and knees (cut-off date
November 17, 2003) and 169 claims for reprocessed shells
(cut-off date September 8, 2004). The Company believes
the litigation liability recorded as of December 31,
2003 is adequate to provide for any future claims regarding the
hip and knee implant litigation.

The Company is also subject to product liability
and other claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of
business, for which the Company maintains insurance, subject to
self-insured retention limits. The Company establishes accruals
for product liability and other claims in conjunction with
outside counsel based on current information and historical
settlement information for open claims, related fees and for
claims incurred but not reported. While it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the
opinion of management that, upon ultimate resolution, these
cases will not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows of the Company.

On July 25, 2003, the Staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission informed Centerpulse that it
was conducting an informal investigation of Centerpulse relating
to certain accounting issues. The Company is cooperating with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in this matter.

On February 6, 2004, BTG International
Limited (“BTG”) filed an action against the Company
and two unrelated parties in the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware alleging infringement by the
defendants of U.S. Patent No. 6,352,559 (the“’559
Patent”). The Company’s

Trilogy

Acetabular
System is specifically accused of infringement, as well as
Centerpulse’s

Converge

and

Allofit

TM

Acetabular Systems. BTG’s
complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief. On
March 4, 2004, the Company filed an answer to the complaint
denying infringement, and asserting a counterclaim alleging that
the ’559 Patent is invalid. The Company believes that its
defenses are valid and meritorious and the Company intends to
defend the BTG lawsuit vigorously.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

The Company has established disclosure controls
and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting
to provide reasonable assurance that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known on a timely basis to management and
the Board of Directors. However, any control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a
company have been detected.

Based on their evaluation, the Company’s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report
are effective.

Since the acquisition of control of Centerpulse
on October 2, 2003, the results of operations of
Centerpulse have been included in the Company’s
consolidated results of operations, and its respective
assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair
values in the Company’s consolidated statement of financial
position, with the excess purchase price being allocated to
goodwill. Historically,

Centerpulse’s consolidated financial statements were
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, which differ in certain material respects from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“U.S. GAAP”) which the Company must
follow. Following the completion of the acquisition, the
necessary adjustments were made within the Company’s
financial statements to adjust the Centerpulse financial
statements to U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company has
integrated Centerpulse operating units into the Company’s
financial reporting system. New accounting policies and
procedures went into effect within the Centerpulse operating
units during the fourth quarter to ensure consistency in
financial reporting among all of the Company’s operating
units. The Company established a common approach for estimating
excess inventories and instruments. The effect of this
change in estimate is further described under Item 7,
Critical Accounting Estimates. Other than these changes, there
were no significant changes in the Company’s internal
controls during the most recent quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
