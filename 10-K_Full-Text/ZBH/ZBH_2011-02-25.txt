ANNUAL REPORT

PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

OVERVIEW

We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture
    and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive, spinal and trauma
    devices, dental implants and related surgical products. We also
    provide other healthcare related services. In this report,
    “Zimmer,” “we,” “us,”
    “our” and similar words refer collectively to Zimmer
    Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to
    the parent company only.

Zimmer Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our
    history dates to 1927, when Zimmer Manufacturing Company, a
    predecessor, was founded in Warsaw, Indiana. On August 6,
    2001, Zimmer Holdings was spun off from its former parent and
    became an independent public company.

CUSTOMERS, SALES
    AND MARKETING

Our primary customers include orthopaedic surgeons,
    neurosurgeons, oral surgeons, dentists, hospitals, stocking
    distributors, healthcare dealers and, in their capacity as
    agents, healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups.
    These customers range from large multinational enterprises to
    independent surgeons.

We have operations in more than 25 countries and market products
    in more than 100 countries, with corporate headquarters in
    Warsaw, Indiana, and more than 100 manufacturing,
    distribution and warehousing

and/or

office facilities worldwide. We manage our operations through
    three major geographic segments — the Americas, which
    is comprised principally of the U.S. and includes other
    North, Central and South American markets; Europe, which is
    comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and
    Africa markets; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily
    of Japan and Australia and includes other Asian and Pacific
    markets.

We market and sell products through three principal channels:
    1) direct to healthcare institutions, such as hospitals or
    direct channel accounts; 2) through stocking distributors
    and healthcare dealers; and 3) directly to dental practices
    and dental laboratories. With direct channel accounts, inventory
    is generally consigned to sales agents or customers. With sales
    to stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices
    and dental laboratories, title to product passes upon shipment
    or upon implantation of the product. Direct channel accounts
    represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in
    2010. No individual direct channel account, stocking
    distributor, healthcare dealer, dental practice or dental
    laboratory accounted for more than 1 percent of our net
    sales for 2010.

We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title
    to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products
    are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock
    levels are determined based on a number of factors, including
    demand, manufacturing lead times and quantities required to
    maintain service levels. We also carry trade accounts receivable
    balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent
    with local market practices.

We utilize a network of sales associates, sales managers and
    support personnel, most of whom are employed or contracted by
    independent distributors and sales agencies. We invest a
    significant amount of time and expense in training sales
    associates in how to use specific products and how to best
    inform surgeons of product features and uses. Sales force
    representatives must have strong technical selling skills and
    medical education to provide technical support for surgeons.

In response to the different healthcare systems throughout the
    world, our sales and marketing strategies and organizational
    structures differ by region. We utilize a global approach to
    sales force training, marketing and medical education to provide
    consistent, high quality service. Additionally, we keep current
    with key surgical developments and other issues related to
    orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, dentists and oral surgeons
    and the medical procedures they perform.

Americas.

The Americas is our largest
    geographic segment, accounting for $2,431.6 million, or
    58 percent, of 2010 net sales, with the
    U.S. accounting for 94 percent of net sales in this
    region. The U.S. sales force primarily consists of
    independent sales agents, most of whom sell products exclusively
    for Zimmer. Sales agents in the U.S. receive a commission
    on product sales and are responsible for many operating
    decisions and costs. Sales commissions are accrued at the time
    of sale.

In this region, we contract with group purchasing organizations
    and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by
    offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions
    within a specified group. Generally, we are designated as one of
    several preferred purchasing sources for specified products,
    although members are not obligated to purchase our products.
    Contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a
    term of three years, with extensions as warranted.

In the Americas, we monitor and rank independent sales agents
    across a range of performance metrics, including the achievement
    of certain sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of
    working capital.

Europe.

The European geographic segment
    accounted for $1,099.5 million, or 26 percent, of
    2010 net sales, with France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
    Switzerland and the United Kingdom collectively accounting
    for 74 percent of net sales in the region. This segment
    also includes other key markets, including Benelux, Nordic,
    Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our
    sales force in this segment is comprised of direct sales
    associates, commissioned agents, independent distributors and
    sales support personnel. In Europe, we emphasize the advantages
    of our clinically

proven, established designs and innovative solutions, such as
    minimally invasive surgical procedures and technologies and new
    and enhanced materials and surfaces. In most European countries,
    healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore
    government budgets have a role in healthcare spending, which can
    affect our sales in this segment.

Asia Pacific.

The Asia Pacific geographic
    segment accounted for $689.1 million, or 16 percent,
    of 2010 net sales, with Japan being the largest market
    within this segment, accounting for approximately
    55 percent of the region’s sales. This segment also
    includes key markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Korea,
    China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and
    Malaysia. In Japan and most countries in the Asia Pacific
    region, we maintain a network of dealers, who act as order
    agents on behalf of hospitals in the region, and sales
    associates, who build and maintain relationships with
    orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons and dental surgeons in their
    markets. These sales associates cover over 7,000 hospitals in
    the region. The knowledge and skills of these sales associates
    play a critical role in providing service, product information
    and support to surgeons.

SEASONALITY

Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, as many of our
    products are used in elective procedures, which typically
    decline during the summer months and can increase at the end of
    the year once annual deductibles have been attained on health
    insurance plans.

DISTRIBUTION

We operate distribution facilities domestically in Warsaw,
    Indiana; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina; Memphis,
    Tennessee; Carlsbad, California; and Austin, Texas and
    internationally in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the
    Czech Republic, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong,
    India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands,
    New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Africa,
    Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand and the
    United Kingdom.

We generally ship our orders via expedited courier. We do not
    consider our backlog of firm orders to be material to an
    understanding of our business.

PRODUCTS

Our products include orthopaedic reconstructive, spinal and
    trauma devices, dental implants and related surgical products.

We utilize our exclusive

Trabecular
    Metal

tm

Technology across various product categories.

Trabecular
    Metal

Material is a structural biomaterial with a cellular
    architecture that resembles bone and approximates its physical
    and mechanical properties more closely than other prosthetic
    materials. The highly porous trabecular configuration is
    conducive to more normal bone formation and bone in-growth.

Trabecular Metal

Implants are fabricated using elemental
    tantalum metal and a patented vapor deposition technique that
    creates a metallic strut configuration resembling cancellous
    bone with nano-textured surface features.

Orthopaedic
    Reconstructive Implants

Knee
    Implants

Total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral
    component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an articular
    surface (placed on the tibial tray). Knee replacement surgeries
    include first-time, or primary, joint replacement procedures and
    revision procedures for the replacement, repair or enhancement
    of an implant or component from a previous procedure. Knee
    implants are designed to accommodate different levels of
    ligament stabilization of the joint. While some knee implant
    designs, called cruciate retaining (CR) designs, require the
    retention of the posterior cruciate ligament, other designs,
    called posterior stabilized (PS) and ultracongruent (UC)
    designs, provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate
    ligament. There are also procedures for partial reconstruction
    of the knee, which treat limited knee degeneration and involve
    the replacement of only one side, or compartment, of the knee
    with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis.

Our portfolio of

Minimally Invasive
    Solutions

tm

Procedures (MIS) includes the MIS Mini-Incision Total Knee
    Procedure. The MIS Mini-Incision Procedure utilizes specialized
    MIS Instruments which feature smaller, ergonomic and highly
    precise instruments which accommodate and facilitate a smaller
    incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft tissues.

We offer a wide range of products for specialized knee
    procedures, including the following:

NexGen

®

Complete Knee Solution.  The number one selling knee
    brand in the world, the

NexGen

tm

Implants are an important strategic focus, as more than half of
    total knee arthroplasty patients are female.

Gender Solutions

Femorals are available in both

NexGen

CR-Flex and
    LPS-Flex configurations. The concept of advancing implant design
    through customization based on anatomy or other patient
    characteristics has manifested in rapidly expanding gender
    technologies across the continuum of our products and into other
    important brands in our growing portfolio.

The

NexGen

    was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
    (FDA). The

Zimmer

Patient Specific Instruments simplify a
    total knee procedure and help enhance appropriate placement of
    the final implant based on a surgeon’s preoperative
    surgical plan. Based on a patient’s MRI scan, a computer
    generated, custom guide is produced to conform to a
    patient’s unique knee anatomy. This guide is then utilized
    intraoperatively to aid in the surgical correction of the
    patient’s knee.

Zimmer

®

Segmental System.  Adding to our broad portfolio of
    revision options, the

Zimmer

Segmental System is a
    comprehensive system designed to address patients with severe

    stability.

Hip
    Implants

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the
    femur and the socket portion of the pelvis (acetabulum) of the
    natural hip. Hip procedures include first time, or primary,
    joint replacement as well as revision procedures. Approximately
    30 percent of hip implant procedures involve the use of
    bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the
    surrounding bone. The remaining are

    polyester band that permits an even distribution of stresses on
    bone.

Trauma

Trauma products include devices used to stabilize damaged or
    broken bones and their surrounding tissues to support the
    body’s natural healing processes. Fractures are most often
    stabilized using internal fixation devices such as plates,
    screws, nails, wires and pins, but may also be stabilized using
    external fixation devices. Orthobiologics are used in
    conjunction with traditional trauma devices to encourage healing
    and replace bone lost during an injury. We are focused on
    providing exceptional options to treat a broad range of
    traumatic injuries, addressing unmet clinical needs and
    implementing next-generation technologies into our portfolio of

applications. This group works on biological solutions to repair
    and regenerate damaged or degenerated musculoskeletal tissues
    using biomaterials/cell therapies which offer the possibility of
    treating damaged joints by biological repair rather than
    replacing them. A sampling of some of our key projects in the
    Orthobiologics area is set forth below.

We are collaborating with ISTO Technologies, Inc. (ISTO) to
    develop chondral grafts for cartilage repair. ISTO creates
    cell-based therapies for cartilage regeneration using cells from
    juvenile donor cartilage.

DeNovo

®

NT Natural Tissue Graft was commercialized in 2009 and
    represents our first product entry into the cartilage repair
    market. This tissue product provides particulated juvenile
    cartilage tissue for repair of articular cartilage defects of
    the knee, ankle, shoulder, hip, elbow and toe joints. More than
    1,700 patients have undergone this innovative cartilage
    repair procedure.

DeNovo

ET Engineered Tissue Graft is a
    living tissue-engineered cartilage graft under clinical
    investigation for the restoration of cartilage defects,
    reestablishment of joint function and relief of pain in the

    been completed and the data has been supplied to the FDA with a
    request to allow Zimmer/ISTO to proceed with enrollment of the
    pivotal Phase III clinical trial.

Many musculoskeletal surgical procedures use bone grafts to help
    regenerate lost or damaged bone. Our Spine, Dental and Trauma
    divisions have introduced a technologically advanced all-human
    demineralized bone matrix,

Puros

DBM Putty and Putty with
    bone chips. This bone-derived allograft material is used to fill
    bone voids or defects. It is placed into the bone void where it
    is then completely replaced by natural bone during the healing
    process.

RESEARCH AND
    DEVELOPMENT

We have extensive research and development activities to develop
    new surgical techniques, materials, orthobiologics and product
    designs. The research and development functions work closely
    with our strategic brand marketing function. The rapid
    commercialization of innovative new materials, orthobiologics
    products, implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques
    remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an
    important driver of sales growth.

We are broadening our product offerings in each of our product
    categories and exploring new technologies with possible
    applications in multiple areas. For the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we spent
    $220.0 million, $205.7 million and
    $192.3 million, respectively, on research and development.
    Our primary research and development facility is located in
    Warsaw, Indiana. We have other research and development
    personnel based in, among other places, Winterthur, Switzerland;
    Austin, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Carlsbad, California;
    Dover, Ohio; and Parsippany, New Jersey. As of December 31,
    2010, we employed more than 1,000 research and development
    employees worldwide.

We expect to continue to identify innovative technologies and
    consider acquiring complementary products or businesses, or
    establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic
    alliances.

GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE

We are subject to government regulation in the countries in
    which we conduct business. In the U.S., numerous laws and
    regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices
    are brought to market. These include, among others, the Federal
    Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations issued or
    promulgated thereunder. The FDA has enacted regulations that
    control all aspects of the development, manufacture,
    advertising, promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical
    products, including medical devices. In addition, the FDA
    controls the access of products to market through processes
    designed to ensure that only products that are safe and
    effective are made available to the public.

Most of our new products fall into an FDA classification that
    requires the submission of a Premarket Notification (510(k)) to
    the FDA. This process requires us to demonstrate that the device
    to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is,
    substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device. We must
    submit information that supports our substantial equivalency
    claims. Before we can market the new device, we must receive an
    order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence and clearing
    the new device for commercial distribution in the
    U.S. Other devices we develop and market are in a category
    (class) for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical
    investigation and Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. The PMA
    process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that
    establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective.
    The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution
    if it determines that the data and information in the PMA
    constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is
    reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for
    its intended use(s). All of our devices marketed in the
    U.S. have been cleared or approved by the FDA, with the
    exception of certain

pre-amendment

devices which were in commercial distribution prior to
    May 28, 1976. The FDA has grandfathered these devices, so
    new FDA submissions are not required. The FDA has the authority
    to: halt the distribution of certain medical devices; detain or
    seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; or order the
    repair, replacement or refund of the costs of such devices and
    to seek criminal prosecution of executives for violation of FDA
    regulations. There are also certain requirements of state, local
    and foreign governments that we must comply with in the
    manufacture and marketing of our products.

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our
    products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among
    other things, design and product standards, packaging
    requirements and labeling requirements. Many of the regulations
    applicable to our devices and products in these countries are
    similar to those of the FDA. The member countries of the
    European Union have adopted the European Medical Device
    Directive, which creates a single set of medical device
    regulations for products marketed in all member countries.
    Compliance with the Medical Device Directive and certification
    to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a CE mark
    on its products. To obtain



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

authorization to affix the CE mark to a product, a recognized
    European Notified Body must assess a manufacturer’s quality
    systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of
    the Medical Device Directive. We are subject to inspection by
    the Notified Bodies for compliance with these requirements.

Further, we are subject to various federal and state laws
    concerning healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims
    laws and anti-kickback laws. These laws are administered by,
    among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of
    Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
    and state attorneys general. Many of these agencies have
    increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical
    device manufacturers in recent years. Violations of these laws
    are punishable by criminal

and/or

civil
    sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment
    and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government
    healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans
    Administration (VA) health programs.

Our operations in foreign countries are subject to the
    extraterritorial application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act (FCPA). As part of our global compliance program,
    we seek to address FCPA risks proactively.

Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex
    federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational
    safety laws and regulations, including those relating to
    discharges of substances in the air, water and land, the
    handling, storage and disposal of wastes and the

clean-up

of
    properties by pollutants. We do not expect that the ongoing
    costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will
    have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital
    expenditures or competitive position.

We continue to assess the impact that the healthcare reform
    legislation passed in 2010 by the U.S. federal government
    will have on our business. The new law includes a
    2.3 percent excise tax on a majority of our U.S. sales
    that is scheduled to be implemented in 2013.

COMPETITION

The orthopaedics industry is highly competitive. In the global
    markets for reconstructive implants, trauma and related surgical
    products, our major competitors include: DePuy Orthopaedics,
    Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Stryker
    Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Smith & Nephew plc, Wright
    Medical Group, Inc., Synthes, Inc. and Tornier, Inc.

In the Americas geographic segment, we and DePuy Orthopaedics,
    Inc., Stryker Corporation, Biomet, Inc.,
    Smith & Nephew, Inc. (a subsidiary of
    Smith & Nephew plc), Wright Medical Group, Inc. and
    Synthes, Inc. account for a large majority of the total
    reconstructive and trauma implant sales.

In the Asia Pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma
    products, we compete primarily with DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.,
    Stryker Corporation, Synthes, Inc., Smith & Nephew plc
    and Biomet, Inc., as well as regional companies, including Japan
    Medical Materials Corporation and Japan Medical Dynamic
    Marketing, Inc. Factors, such as the dealer system and complex
    regulatory environments, make it difficult for smaller
    companies, particularly those that are non-regional, to compete
    effectively with the market leaders in the Asia Pacific region.

The European reconstructive implant and trauma product markets
    are more fragmented than the Americas or the Asia Pacific
    segments. The variety of philosophies held by European surgeons
    regarding hip reconstruction, for example, has fostered the
    existence of many regional European companies, including
    Aesculap AG (a subsidiary of B. Braun), Waldemar LINK
    GmbH & Co., KG and Mathys AG which, in addition to the
    global competitors, compete with us. Today most hip implants
    sold in Europe are products developed specifically for the
    European market, although global products are gaining
    acceptance. We will continue to develop and produce specially
    tailored products to meet specific European needs.

In the spinal implant category, we compete globally primarily
    with the spinal and biologic business of Medtronic, Inc., DePuy
    Spine (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Synthes,
    Inc., Stryker Corporation, Biomet Spine (a subsidiary of Biomet,
    Inc.) and NuVasive, Inc.

In the dental implant category, we compete primarily with Nobel
    Biocare Holding AG, Straumann Holding AG, Astra Tech Dental,
    Dentsply International and Biomet 3i (a subsidiary of Biomet,
    Inc.).

Competition within the industry is primarily based on
    technology, innovation, quality, reputation and customer
    service. A key factor in our continuing success in the future
    will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing
    products and technologies.

MANUFACTURING AND
    RAW MATERIALS

We manufacture substantially all of our products at nine sites,
    including Warsaw, Indiana; Winterthur, Switzerland; Ponce,
    Puerto Rico; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina; Carlsbad,
    California; Parsippany, New Jersey; Shannon, Ireland; and
    Etupes, France. Additionally, in December 2010 we acquired two
    businesses, Beijing Montagne Medical Device Co., Ltd. (Montagne)
    and Sodem Diffusion S.A. (Sodem). Montagne has manufacturing
    facilities in Beijing and Xianning, China and Sodem has
    manufacturing facilities in Geneva, Switzerland. We expect these
    facilities will become an important part of our manufacturing
    network.

We believe that our manufacturing facilities are among the best
    in our industry in terms of automation and productivity and have
    the flexibility to accommodate future growth. The manufacturing
    operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the
    cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a
    manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous operational
    improvement and optimization. Our continuous improvement efforts
    are driven by Lean and Six Sigma methodologies. In addition, at
    certain of our manufacturing facilities, many of the employees
    are cross-trained to perform a broad array of operations.

We generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at
    levels up to 90 percent of total capacity. We continually

evaluate the potential to in-source products currently purchased
    from outside vendors to

on-site

production.

We have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our
    profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs. We
    have, for example, employed computer-assisted robots and
    multi-axis grinders to precision polish medical devices;
    automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes,
    including on-machine inspection and process controls; purchased

state-of-the-art

equipment; in-sourced core products, such as castings and
    forgings; and negotiated reductions in third party supplier
    costs.

We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the
    manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw
    materials and select components used in manufacturing our
    products from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase some
    supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance,
    sole source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints
    resulting from regulatory requirements. We work closely with our
    suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high
    quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any
    significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials
    necessary to fulfill our production schedules.

INTELLECTUAL
    PROPERTY

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the
    continued success of our business. We also rely upon trade
    secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and
    licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive
    position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of
    methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary
    information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and
    others who may have access to proprietary information. We own or
    control through licensing arrangements more than 5,000 issued
    patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate
    to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our
    products.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2010, we employed more than
    8,800 employees worldwide, including more than
    1,000 employees dedicated to research and development.
    Approximately 4,900 employees are located within the
    U.S. and approximately 3,900 employees are located
    outside of the U.S., primarily throughout Europe and in Japan.
    We have over 3,700 employees dedicated to manufacturing our
    products worldwide. The Warsaw, Indiana production facility
    employs more than 1,500 employees. Approximately
    150 U.S. employees are members of a trade union
    covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

We have a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steel,
    Paper and Forestry, Rubber Manufacturing, Energy, Allied
    Industrial and Service Workers International Union for and on
    behalf of Local

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from
    our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial
    condition and results of operations are discussed below and
    elsewhere in this report. The risks and uncertainties described
    below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently
    not believed to be significant to our business may also affect
    our actual results and could harm our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

uncertainties described below or any additional risks and
    uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of
    operations and financial condition could be materially and
    adversely affected.

If we fail to comply with the terms of the Corporate
    Integrity Agreement we entered into in September 2007, we may be
    subject to exclusion from federal healthcare programs.

As previously reported, in September 2007 we settled an
    investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office
    for the District of New Jersey (U.S. Attorney) into
    financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers
    and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. As part of that settlement,
    we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the
    Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and
    Human Services (OIG-HHS). A copy of the CIA is filed as an
    exhibit to this report. If we do not comply with the terms of
    the CIA, we could be subject to exclusion by OIG-HHS from
    participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicaid
    and Medicare.

The ongoing investigation by the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice
    regarding potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
    Act in the sale of medical devices in a number of foreign
    countries by companies in the medical device industry could have
    a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
    and cash flows.

We are cooperating fully with the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice with
    regard to an ongoing investigation of potential violations of
    the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the sale of medical devices
    in a number of foreign countries by companies in the medical
    device industry. Although we have adopted policies and
    procedures designed to prevent improper payments and we train
    our employees, distributors and others concerning these issues,
    we cannot assure that violations of these requirements will not
    occur. If we are found to have violated the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act, we may face sanctions including fines, criminal
    penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment
    of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive
    export licenses.

If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors
    upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may
    not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may
    decline.

Our marketing success in the U.S. and abroad depends
    significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales
    and service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents
    have developed professional relationships with existing and
    potential customers because of the agents’ detailed
    knowledge of products and instruments. A loss of a significant
    number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on
    our business and results of operations.

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our
    products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy
    our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we
    may not anticipate because of:

•

evolving customer needs;

•

changing demographics;

•

slowing industry growth rates;

•

declines in the reconstructive implant market;

•

the introduction of new products and technologies;

•

evolving surgical philosophies; and

•

evolving industry standards.

Without the timely introduction of new products and
    enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If
    that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer.
    The success of our new product offerings will depend on several
    factors, including our ability to:

•

properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

•

commercialize new products in a timely manner;

•

manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient
    volumes on time;

•

differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings;

•

achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

•

satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers
    and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative
    recovery and lower-cost procedures;

•

innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical
    techniques; and

•

provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical
    techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some
    or all markets, because of, among other factors:

•

entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

•

the need for regulatory clearance; and

•

uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment
    in research and development before we can determine their
    commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources
    necessary to fund the production. In addition, even if we are
    able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of
    our products, these enhancements or new generations of products
    may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development
    and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer
    preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products
    embodying new technologies or features.

We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside
    of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks and
    may cause our profitability to decline due to increased
    costs.

We sell our products in more than 100 countries and derive more
    than 40 percent of our net sales from outside the
    U.S. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities
    in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which
    could expose us to additional risks associated with
    international sales and operations. Our international operations



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and
    potential costs, including:

•

changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

•

unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;

•

differing local product preferences and product requirements;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries
    outside of the U.S.;

•

trade protection measures and import or export requirements that
    may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and
    may increase our operating costs;

•

foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from
    repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;

•

complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

•

extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

labor force instability;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax
    laws; and

•

political and economic instability.

Violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines,
    criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees,
    prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our
    reputation.

We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate
    fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our
    profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.

A substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in
    Europe and Japan. The U.S. dollar value of our
    foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate
    fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the
    U.S. dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese Yen, as
    well as other currencies, could have a material adverse effect
    on our results of operations. Although we address currency risk
    management through regular operating and financing activities,
    and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial
    instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.

We may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology
    and other intellectual property, which would allow competitors
    or others to take advantage of our research and development
    efforts.

Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market
    technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or
    maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not
    be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary
    technologies. Also, our currently pending or future patent
    applications may not result in issued patents, and issued
    patents are subject to claims concerning priority, scope and
    other issues.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the courts have
    not consistently treated the breadth of claims allowed or
    interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and
    biotechnology patents. Future changes in, or unexpected
    interpretations of, the patent laws may adversely affect our
    ability to enforce our patent position.

In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or
    of limited effect in some foreign countries. If we do not obtain
    sufficient international protection for our intellectual
    property, our competitiveness in international markets could be
    impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue.

We also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary
    know-how and continuing technological innovation with security
    measures, including the use of confidentiality agreements with
    our employees, consultants and collaborators. These measures may
    prove to be ineffective and any remedies available to us may be
    insufficient to compensate our damages.

We may be subject to intellectual property litigation and
    infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant
    expenses or prevent us from selling our products.

A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property
    infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and
    profitability, in some cases materially. From time to time, we
    receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and
    receive claims of potential infringement. We may be unaware of
    intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of
    our technology. If someone claims that our products infringed
    their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation
    could be costly and time consuming and would divert the
    attention of management and key personnel from other business
    issues. If we were to lose such litigation involving material
    intellectual property rights, we may be unable to manufacture,
    sell or use some of our products.

We may incur product liability losses, and insurance coverage
    may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.

In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of
    product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures,
    manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of
    product-related risks or product-related information resulted in
    an unsafe condition or injury to patients. As previously
    reported, we temporarily suspended the marketing and
    distribution of our

Durom

®

Acetabular Component (

Durom

Cup) in the U.S. in July
    2008. Following our action, product liability lawsuits and other
    claims were asserted against us and additional similar claims
    may be asserted. Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety
    alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome,
    could have a material adverse effect on our business and
    reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.

Although we maintain third-party product liability insurance
    coverage, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the
    coverage limits of our insurance policies or cause us to record
    a self-insured loss. Even if any product liability loss is
    covered by an insurance policy, these policies typically have
    substantial retentions or deductibles for which we are
    responsible. Product liability claims in excess of applicable
    insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

We are involved in legal proceedings that may result in
    adverse outcomes.

In addition to intellectual property and product liability
    claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial and
    securities litigation and claims, government investigations and
    other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the
    ordinary course of our business. Although we believe we have
    substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other
    claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and
    management’s view of these matters may change in the
    future. We could in the future incur judgments or enter into
    settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect
    on our results of operations in any particular period.

We may make additional acquisitions or enter into strategic
    alliances that could increase our costs or liabilities or be
    disruptive.

We intend to continue to look for additional strategic
    acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our
    businesses and other companies with whom we could form strategic
    alliances or enter into other arrangements to develop or exploit
    intellectual property rights. These activities involve risks,
    including the following:

•

we may need to divert more management resources to integration
    than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to
    pursue other more profitable activities;

•

the difficulties of integrating acquired businesses may be
    increased if we need to integrate geographically separated
    organizations, personnel with disparate business backgrounds and
    companies with different corporate cultures;

•

we may not recognize expected cost savings or the anticipated
    benefits of acquisitions or strategic alliances;

•

our acquisition candidates or strategic partners may have
    unexpected liabilities or prove unable to meet their obligations
    to us or the joint venture; and

•

the priorities of our strategic partners may prove incompatible
    with ours.

We depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw
    materials and outsourced activities.

We use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to
    manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing
    activities. These suppliers must provide the materials and
    perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our
    quality and regulatory requirements. Some key raw materials and
    outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source
    or a limited number of sources. A prolonged disruption or other
    inability to obtain these materials or outsource key
    manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect
    our ability to satisfy demand for our products.

Future material impairments in the carrying value of our
    intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect
    our operating results.

Our assets include intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The
    goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents
    the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value
    of the net assets acquired. We assess at least annually whether
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable. If the
    operating performance at one or more of our business units falls
    significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative
    technologies emerge, or if market conditions or future cash flow
    estimates for one or more of our businesses decline, we could be
    required, under current U.S. accounting rules, to record a
    non-cash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the
    impairment. Any write-off of a material portion of our
    unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our
    results of operations.

We may have additional tax liabilities.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign
    jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining
    our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course
    of our business, there are many transactions and calculations
    where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly
    are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax
    estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits
    and any related litigation could be materially different from
    our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results
    of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our
    financial statements in the period or periods for which that
    determination is made.

We earn a significant amount of our operating income from
    outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held
    in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax
    rates. In addition, there have been proposals to change
    U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how
    U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign
    earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form
    this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a
    material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.

In January 2011, the IRS issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment
    (NOPA) for tax years 2006 and 2007. The NOPA relates to
    intercompany pricing between certain of our U.S. and
    foreign subsidiaries. We believe that we have followed
    applicable U.S. tax laws and will vigorously defend our
    income tax positions. However, the ultimate settlement with the
    IRS related to these proposed adjustments could have a material
    impact on our income tax expense and net earnings.

The impact of U.S. healthcare reform legislation on us
    remains uncertain.

In March 2010, federal legislation to reform the
    U.S. healthcare system was enacted into law. The
    legislation is far-reaching and is intended to expand access to
    health insurance coverage, improve quality and reduce costs over
    time. We expect the new law will have a significant impact upon
    various aspects of our business operations. For example, to the
    extent that the number of uninsured or underinsured patients is
    reduced, demand for our products in the U.S. could
    marginally increase. However, it is unclear how the new law will
    impact patient access to new technologies or reimbursement rates
    under the Medicare program. In addition, the new law imposes a
    2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices scheduled to be
    implemented in 2013 that will apply to U.S. sales of a
    majority of our medical device products.

Many of the details of the new law will be included in new and
    revised regulations, which have not yet been promulgated, and
    require additional guidance and specificity to be provided

by the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of
    Labor and Department of the Treasury. Accordingly, while it is
    too early to understand and predict the ultimate impact of the
    new law on our business, the legislation could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition
    and results of operations.

We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on
    an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business
    practices and restrict our operations in the future.

Our industry is subject to various federal and state laws
    pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims
    laws, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, similar state laws and
    physician self-referral laws. Violations of these laws are
    punishable by criminal

and/or

civil
    sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment
    and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government
    healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans
    Administration (VA) health programs. The interpretation and
    enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and
    subject to rapid change.

If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for
    our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our
    products may decline and our ability to sell our products
    profitably may be harmed.

We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors,
    dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which receive
    reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their
    patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and
    international government programs, private insurance plans and
    managed care programs. These third-party payors may deny
    reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a
    procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment
    methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for
    an unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline to
    reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. If our
    products are not considered cost-effective by third-party
    payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for our products.

In addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to
    contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level
    of reimbursement for medical products and services. If
    third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and
    other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our
    products may decline, or we may experience pressure to reduce
    the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our sales and results of operations.

We have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing
    and other effects of healthcare reform in our international
    markets. If key participants in government healthcare systems
    reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and
    results of operations may be adversely affected.

The ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing
    organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations.

Many customers for our products have formed group purchasing
    organizations in an effort to contain costs. Group purchasing
    organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply
    manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are
    made available to a group purchasing organization’s
    affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the
    providers selected by a group purchasing organization,
    affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to
    purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization
    has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another
    manufacturer’s products, we may be precluded from making
    sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the
    duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to respond
    to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing
    organizations may cause us to lose market share to our
    competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our
    sales and results of operations.

Our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and
    market our products against those of our competitors.

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our present or
    future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by
    technological advances by one or more of our present or future
    competitors or by other therapies, including biological
    therapies. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop
    and acquire new products and technologies. Competition is
    primarily on the basis of:

•

technology;

•

innovation;

•

quality;

•

reputation; and

•

customer service.

In markets outside of the U.S., other factors influence
    competition as well, including:

•

local distribution systems;

•

complex regulatory environments; and

•

differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

Our competitors may:

•

have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

•

respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

•

undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

•

adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

•

be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees
    and strategic partners.

Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to
    have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.

We and our customers are subject to various governmental
    regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and
    marketing of our products, and we may incur significant expenses
    to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible
    with these regulations.

The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market
    are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other
    federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process
    of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can
    be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted
    for future products on a timely



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain,
    approvals for future products could result in delayed
    realization of product revenues or in substantial additional
    costs.

In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable material
    regulatory requirements, including, for example, the Quality
    System Regulation, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and
    promotional requirements and adverse event reporting
    regulations, we may be subject to a range of sanctions including:

•

warning letters;

•

fines or civil penalties;

•

injunctions;

•

repairs, replacements or refunds;

•

recalls or seizures of products;

•

total or partial suspension of production;

•

the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or
    approvals;

•

withdrawals or suspensions of current product
    applications; and

•

criminal prosecution.

Moreover, the FDA recently announced wide-ranging proposals to
    reform the 510(k) process. While it is not known which reforms
    may ultimately be implemented, they may result in more extensive
    data requirements and a longer process for obtaining clearance.
    We expect 510(k) reform could delay new products from reaching
    the market in the U.S. and increase the costs of
    introducing new products and features, which could adversely
    affect our business.

Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules
    of industrial standards bodies, such as the International
    Standards Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of
    these regulations, our business could be harmed.

We believe the current facilities, including manufacturing,
    warehousing, research and development and office space provide
    sufficient capacity to meet ongoing demands. Once a facility
    reaches 85 percent utilization, we examine alternatives for
    either expanding that facility or acquiring new facilities to
    meet our ongoing demands.

In addition to the above, we maintain more than 100 other
    offices and warehouse facilities in more than 25 countries
    around the world, including the U.S., Japan, Australia, France,
    Russia, India, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and China. We believe
    that all of the facilities and equipment are in good condition,
    well maintained and able to operate at present levels.

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
    conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
    corresponding notes included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis
    are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and
    therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for
    disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2009 and 2008
    consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
    conform to the 2010 presentation.

OVERVIEW

We believe the following developments or trends are important in
    understanding our financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Demand (Volume
    and Mix) Trends

Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales
    contributed 3 percentage points of 2010 sales growth, which
    is 1 percentage point above the rate of growth from 2009
    compared to 2008.

We believe long-term indicators point toward sustained growth
    driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging
    markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material
    technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active
    lifestyles, among other factors. In addition, the ongoing shift
    in demand to premium products, such as

Longevity

and

Prolong

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylenes,

Trabecular
    Metal

Technology products, hip stems with

Kinectiv

Technology, high-flex knees, knee revision products, porous
    hip stems and the introduction of patient specific devices, is
    expected to continue to positively affect sales growth.

Pricing
    Trends

Global selling prices decreased 1 percent during 2010.
    Selling prices in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific
    decreased 1 percent, were flat, and decreased
    2 percent, respectively, during 2010. We continue to see
    pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment
    efforts and from local hospitals and health systems. In the
    Americas, we have experienced compression of historic pricing
    differentials amongst our customers. Asia Pacific was especially
    influenced by a bi-annual pricing adjustment in Japan that went
    into effect on April 1, 2010. Due to these pressures, we
    expect selling prices will continue to have a negative 1 to
    2 percent effect on sales on a global basis in 2011.

Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rates

For 2010, foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a
    1 percent increase in sales. If foreign currency exchange
    rates remain consistent with 2010 year end rates, we
    estimate that a weaker dollar versus foreign currency exchange
    rates will have a positive effect in 2011 of approximately
    1 percent on sales. We address currency risk through
    regular operating and financing activities and, under
    appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization,
    through the use of forward contracts and options solely to
    manage foreign currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign
    currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to
    offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which
    are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net
    earnings in the near term is expected to be minimal.

Global Economic
    Conditions

We believe adverse conditions in the broader economy have
    negatively affected elective hospital procedures. In the fourth
    quarter of 2010, we saw some stabilization in procedure volumes
    and we believe the number of procedures will increase as the
    global economy strengthens. Despite the current conditions of
    the global economy, it is well known that demographic trends
    will expand the patient base that needs our products. We believe
    these factors will ultimately foster long-term sustained growth
    even if in the short-term the timing of these elective
    procedures continues to be adversely affected.

    Outlook

We estimate our sales will grow between 3 and 5 percent in
    2011. Such sales growth assumes knee and hip procedures will
    grow in low single digits with modest global economic growth and
    relatively stable employment. As discussed previously, we expect
    pricing to have a negative effect on sales growth by 1 to
    2 percent, and foreign currency exchange rates to have a
    positive effect on sales growth by approximately 1 percent
    based upon December 31, 2010 rates.

Assuming currency rates remain at December 31, 2010 rates,
    we expect our gross margin to be approximately 75 percent
    of sales in 2011. This takes into account anticipated losses
    from foreign currency hedge losses resulting from relative
    weakness in the U.S. Dollar. We expect to continue making
    investments in research and development (R&D) in the range
    of 5 to 6 percent of sales. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percent of sales is
    expected to be between 40 and 41 percent as we realize
    operational efficiencies from global restructuring and
    transformation initiatives and leverage revenue growth.

We expect to incur $75 to $80 million of expenses in 2011
    related to certain global restructuring and transformation
    initiatives. We also expect to incur an additional $15 to
    $20 million for certain acquisition and integration costs
    connected with recent acquisitions. We anticipate recognizing
    some of the $90 to $100 million in cost of products sold
    and the majority in “Special items” on our statement
    of net earnings. The gross margin and SG&A percentages
    discussed above do not include these expenses.

We expect interest and other expense to be approximately
    $50 million in 2011, which is slightly lower than 2010 as
    we have entered into an interest rate swap to effectively
    convert a portion of our $1 billion senior notes from
    fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt.

Knees

Knee sales have experienced flat to moderate growth over the
    past two years. Our knee sales have been affected by broader
    economic conditions impacting volume/mix and competitive
    pressures from newer knee systems that have more modern surgical
    instruments for implantation. We intend to counter these
    competitive pressures in 2011 and thereafter as we continue to
    launch our new patient specific and posterior referencing
    instrumentation systems, as well as through new product
    development.

The

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution product line, including

Gender Solutions

Knee Femoral Implants, the

NexGen

LPS-Flex Knee and the

NexGen

CR-Flex Knee, together
    with the

Gender Solutions Natural-Knee

Flex System led
    knee sales. In addition, sales of partial knee devices,
    including the

Zimmer

Unicompartmental Knee and the
    recently released

Gender Solutions

Patello-Femoral Joint,
    exhibited growth. In Europe, changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates negatively affected knee sales in the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 by 2 percent and
    6 percent, respectively. In Asia Pacific, changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates positively affected knee sales
    in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by
    10 percent and zero percent, respectively.

Hips

Hip sales rebounded from negative growth in 2009 to positive
    growth in 2010 driven by new product introductions, such as our

Continuum

Acetabular System and our

Zimmer

M/L
    Taper Stem with

Kinectiv

Technology.

The

Zimmer

M/L Taper Stem, the

Zimmer

M/L Taper
    Stem with

Kinectiv

Technology, the

CLS Spotorno

Stem from the

CLS

Hip System and the

Alloclassic
    Zweymüller

Hip Stem led hip stem sales. In addition,
    sales of revision hip products, such as the

ZMR

Hip
    System and the

Trabecular Metal

Revision Shell and
    Augment Cups, were strong when compared to the prior year
    periods, as were sales of

Fitmore

Hip Stems. In Europe,
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected
    hip sales in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by
    2 percent and 6 percent, respectively. In Asia
    Pacific, changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively
    affected hip sales in the years ended December 31, 2010 and
    2009 by 8 percent and 4 percent, respectively.

Extremities

Extremities sales have grown by low double digits the past two
    years led by the

Bigliani/Flatow

Complete Shoulder
    Solution and the

Zimmer Trabecular Metal

Reverse Shoulder
    System.

Trabecular Metal

Technology is playing a critical
    role

in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding
    extremities market.

Dental

Dental sales have experienced a significant turnaround from a
    negative 10 percent decline in 2009 to positive
    7 percent growth in 2010. In 2009, our dental sales were
    affected more by the global economic environment than our other
    product categories, as many dental procedures are not reimbursed
    by third-party payors. Sales were led by the

Tapered
    Screw-Vent

Implant System. Additionally, regenerative
    products have exhibited strong sales growth in 2010.

Trauma

Trauma sales increased in the mid single digits the past two
    years.

Zimmer

Periarticular Locking Plates and the

ITST

®

Intertrochanteric/Subtrochanteric Fixation System led trauma
    sales, while sales of cable products also made a strong
    contribution. In 2009, we initiated the launch of the

Zimmer
    Natural Nail

System, which made a strong contribution to
    2010 sales. We anticipate that a broader launch of that system
    will continue to positively affect sales growth.

Spine

In the fourth quarter of 2008 we acquired Abbott Spine. As a
    result of the acquisition, spine sales increased in 2009, but
    underlying that performance were sales losses associated with
    integration of the business. In 2010, once we anniversaried out
    of the additional sales from the acquisition, we experienced
    sales declines, most notably in our Americas segment. In
    addition to the operational challenges associated with the
    integration of the Abbott Spine business in the Americas, a
    difficult reimbursement landscape and a significant decline in
    our

Dynesys

Dynamic Stabilization System have affected
    sales. In contrast to the Americas, our spine sales grew in
    Europe and Asia Pacific in 2010 driven by the stabilization of
    our distribution channels, which followed the Abbott Spine
    integration activity of 2009. Overall, solid sales of the

PathFinder

and

Sequoia

Pedicle Screw Systems, our

Universal Clamp

System and our

Trinica

Anterior
    Cervical Plate System partly offset a decline in sales of the

Dynesys

System.

Surgical
    and other

Surgical and other sales went from 1 percent sales growth
    in 2009 to 13 percent sales growth in 2010. In 2008, we
    voluntarily recalled and suspended production of certain patient
    care products, and were able to reintroduce those products
    during the year in 2009. Accordingly, 2009 sales were
    suppressed, especially in the first half of the year, but we
    started to regain market share in the second half of 2009 and
    throughout 2010. Surgical sales were led by

PALACOS

Bone
    Cement, wound debridement products, tourniquet products and
    powered instruments.

Cost of
    Products Sold

Gross margin in total has not changed significantly over the
    past three years for various offsetting reasons. In the last
    half of 2009 and early 2010, lower production levels caused our
    manufacturing costs per unit to be higher, resulting in
    increased costs in both 2010 and 2009. In 2010, the higher unit
    costs were offset by lower excess and obsolescence charges
    resulting from improved inventory management and certain
    product-specific matters that were experienced in 2009 which did
    not recur in 2010.

Foreign currency hedging also affects our gross margin. Under
    our hedging program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of
    future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair
    value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and
    then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item
    affects earnings. In 2010 and 2009, we recognized hedge gains in
    cost of products sold with 2010 gains being less than 2009
    gains. In 2008, we recognized foreign currency hedge losses.

Operating
    Expenses

R&D expense and R&D as a percent of sales has
    increased in each of the last two years. These increases are in
    line with our strategy to invest in new product development
    activities across nearly all of our product categories, as well
    as to increase spending on external research, clinical,
    regulatory and quality initiatives. Additionally, in 2008 we
    experienced some delay in R&D activities as we implemented
    enhancements to our compliance program. We continue to expect
    R&D spending to be between 5 to 6 percent of sales in
    2011.

SG&A has increased in dollars terms over the last three
    years, but as a percent of sales was lower in 2010 and 2008
    compared to 2009.

In 2010, SG&A increased in dollar terms from 2009 primarily
    for variable selling and distribution expenses as 2010 sales
    were higher than 2009 sales, and from increased spending to fund
    medical education programs. SG&A as a percent of sales in
    2010 decreased by 60 basis points from 2009, reflecting
    disciplined spending combined with a higher base of sales, and
    no expense in 2010 related to corporate monitoring that ended
    after the first quarter of 2009.

In 2009, SG&A as a percent of sales increased approximately
    90 basis points compared to 2008. SG&A expense in the
    2008 period included approximately $60 million of
    incremental costs, such as monitor fees and consulting and legal
    fees associated with the global roll-out of enhancements to our
    compliance program. The savings from these costs in 2009 were
    offset by increased spending to fund enhanced medical education
    programs, Abbott Spine costs and increased product liability
    claims. The acquisition of Abbott Spine increased SG&A
    costs for items such as selling expenses, increased instrument
    depreciation and amortization of the acquired intangible assets.
    Additionally, SG&A as a percentage of net sales was
    negatively impacted by the decrease in revenues caused by
    changes in foreign currency rates. A majority of our SG&A
    spend is incurred in the U.S., primarily from our corporate
    headquarters and similar functions at our various businesses
    such as Dental, Trauma, Spine and Surgical. Therefore, SG&A
    expense does not respond to changes in foreign currency rates
    proportionally to our revenue, which caused SG&A as a
    percentage of net sales to increase in 2009 compared to 2008.

“Certain claims” expense is a provision for estimated
    liabilities to

Durom

Cup patients undergoing revision
    surgeries. Provisions of $35.0 million and
    $69.0 million were originally recorded during 2009 and
    2008, respectively, with an additional $75.0 million
    recorded during 2010, bringing the total provision to
    $179.0 million for these claims. For more information
    regarding these claims, see Note 19 to the consolidated
    financial statements.

In connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests
    performed in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009, we noted that
    the carrying values of the assets of our U.S. Spine
    reporting unit were in excess of the reporting unit’s
    estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded goodwill
    impairment charges of $204.0 million and $73.0 million
    during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. For more information regarding goodwill impairment
    and the factors that led to the impairment, see Note 9 to
    the consolidated financial statements. We have five other
    reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. We estimate the
    fair values of those reporting units using the income approach
    by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows
    of the reporting unit. For each of those five other reporting
    units, the estimated fair values substantially exceed their
    carrying value.

We recognized a net curtailment and settlement gain of
    $32.1 million during 2009 related to amending our
    U.S. and Puerto Rico postretirement benefit plans. For more
    information regarding the net curtailment and settlement gain,
    see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

“Special items” expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $34.7 million,
    $75.3 million and $68.5 million, respectively. 2010
    includes expenses related to restructuring of our information
    technology infrastructure as well as our management structure.
    This resulted in $7.7 million of asset impairment charges
    and $6.7 million of employee severance and
    termination-related expenses. We have also incurred consulting
    and professional fees, facility and employee relocation costs,
    contract termination expenses and other various expenses
    resulting from our acquisitions of Abbott Spine, Beijing
    Montagne Medical Device Co., Ltd, and third party distributors.
    “Special items” also includes the impairment of an

available-for-sale

security that was acquired as part of a business acquisition and
    certain litigation related matters.

“Special items” in 2009 included a workforce
    realignment, which resulted in the elimination of positions in
    some areas and increases in others to support long-term growth.
    As a result of this realignment and headcount reductions from
    acquisitions, we incurred approximately $19.0 million of
    severance and termination-related expenses. Other “Special
    items” in 2009 included approximately $9.4 million of
    expenses related to contract termination costs,
    $23.4 million of certain litigation matters that were
    recognized during the period and various costs incurred to
    integrate the Abbott Spine business acquired in the fourth
    quarter of 2008.

Included in “Special items” in 2008 was
    $38.5 million of in-process research and development
    related to the Abbott Spine acquisition and other costs related
    to the integration of Abbott Spine.



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for
    more information regarding “Special items” charges.

Interest
    and Other, Income Taxes and Net Earnings

Interest and other expense has increased over the past three
    years. Interest and other expense increased in 2010 over 2009
    due to the $1.0 billion senior unsecured notes that we
    issued in November 2009. As a result, in 2010 we had a full year
    of interest on these notes. Interest and other expense in 2009
    increased over 2008 as the result of long-term debt incurred to
    partially fund the Abbott Spine acquisition in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 and the issuance of the senior unsecured notes
    in November 2009. Interest and other income in 2008 included a
    realized gain of $38.8 million related to the sale of
    certain marketable securities.

The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 has been
    30.6 percent, 28.1 percent and 24.3 percent,
    respectively. The effective tax rates for 2010 and 2009 are
    negatively impacted by the goodwill impairment charges of
    $204.0 million and $73.0 million, respectively, for
    which no tax benefit was recorded. The goodwill impairment
    charges have increased the effective tax rate for the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by approximately
    6 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Additionally,
    in 2010 the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the
    resolution of certain tax contingencies. The effective tax rate
    for 2008 includes the impact of a current tax benefit of
    $31.7 million related to a 2007 U.S. government civil
    settlement expense, resulting in a decrease of approximately
    3 percent in the 2008 effective tax rate. This impact on
    the 2008 effective tax rate was partially offset by Abbott Spine
    acquisition-related in-process research and development charges
    recorded during 2008 for which no tax benefit was recorded.
    These discrete items account for the majority of the change in
    our effective tax rates in the past three years.

As a result of the revenues and expenses discussed previously,
    net earnings in 2010 decreased 17 percent compared to 2009.
    In 2009, net earnings decreased 15 percent compared to
    2008. Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased
    11 percent in 2010 compared to 2009, while 2009 basic and
    diluted earnings per share decreased 10 percent and
    11 percent, respectively, from 2008. The disproportionate
    change in earnings per share as compared to net earnings is
    attributed to the effect of share repurchases made in the last
    three years.

Non-GAAP
    operating performance measures

We use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating
    performance that differ from financial measures determined in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles (GAAP). Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the
    impact of inventory

step-up

charges, “Special items,” “Certain claims,”
    Net curtailment and settlement and Goodwill impairment, and the
    taxes on those items and the tax benefit related to a 2007 civil
    settlement. We use this information internally and believe it is
    helpful to investors because it allows more meaningful

period-to-period

comparisons of our on-going operating results, it helps to
    better identify operating trends and perform trend analysis that
    may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items,
    and provides a higher degree of transparency of certain items.
    Certain of these non-GAAP financial measures are used as metrics
    for our incentive compensation programs.

Our non-GAAP adjusted net earnings used for internal management
    purposes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 were $871.6 million, $849.9 million, and
    $924.3 million, respectively, and our non-GAAP adjusted
    diluted earnings per share were $4.33, $3.94, and $4.05,
    respectively.

Our non-GAAP adjusted net earnings increased in 2010 compared to
    2009 due to increased sales, disciplined spending in SG&A,
    and the absence of monitor-related expenses in 2010. Such
    increases to non-GAAP adjusted net earnings were slightly offset
    by increased R&D and medical education expenses and
    increased interest expense from the senior unsecured notes
    issued in 2009.

Our non-GAAP adjusted net earnings decreased in 2009 compared to
    2008 as lower sales and higher R&D and medical education
    expenses reduced non-GAAP adjusted net earnings. Additionally,
    2008 non-GAAP adjusted net earnings featured a
    $38.8 million pre-tax gain related to sales of certain
    marketable securities. The 2009 period did contain some expense
    savings such as the $60 million of incremental savings
    related to monitor fees and consulting and legal fees associated
    with the global roll-out of enhancements to our compliance
    program, but such savings were not enough to offset the other
    items that reduced non-GAAP adjusted net earnings.

The following are reconciliations from our GAAP net earnings and
    diluted earnings per share to our non-GAAP adjusted net earnings
    and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share used for
    internal management purposes.

Healthcare
    Reform in the U.S.

We continue to assess the impact that the healthcare reform
    legislation passed in 2010 by the U.S. federal government
    will have on our business. The new law includes a
    2.3 percent excise tax on a majority of our U.S. sales
    that is scheduled to be implemented in 2013.

LIQUIDITY AND
    CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows provided by operating activities were
    $1,193.5 million in 2010 compared to $1,117.5 million
    in 2009. The principal source of cash from operating activities
    in 2010 was net earnings. Non-cash charges included in net
    earnings accounted for another $535.1 million of operating
    cash. All other items of operating cash flows in 2010 provided
    $61.5 million of cash. The resolution of outstanding
    payments to healthcare professionals and institutions resulted
    in increased cash outflows during the 2009 period compared to
    the delay in similar payments during the 2008 period as we
    implemented enhancements to our compliance program. The
    resolution of these outstanding payments, along with a change in
    the timing of employee bonus payments compared to the 2008
    period and product liability payments, contributed to increased
    outflows from accrued expenses in 2009. Accrued expenses did not
    have any such significant variations in 2010, thus reflecting
    lower outflows in 2010 in our indirect statement of cash flows
    when compared to 2009. We have paid approximately
    $45 million and $25 million in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, related to

Durom

Cup product liability
    claims. We estimate the remaining liability for

Durom

Cup
    claims as of December 31, 2010, is $132.8 million. We
    expect to pay the majority of this amount over the next three
    years.

At December 31, 2010, we had 58 days of sales
    outstanding in trade accounts receivable, an increase of
    2 days when compared to December 31, 2009, reflecting
    some changes in collection practices that may have slightly
    increased days sales outstanding, but have decreased our costs
    to collect at an acceptable risk level. At December 31,
    2010, we had 307 days of inventory on hand, a slight
    increase of 5 days compared to December 31, 2009.

Cash flows used in investing activities were $726.9 million
    in 2010, compared to $381.2 million in 2009. Additions to
    instruments increased in 2010 compared to the 2009 period to
    support new product launches, such as our

Continuum

Acetabular System, and as we introduced new instrumentation
    in our knee product category such as posterior referencing
    instrumentation. In 2011, we expect to spend approximately $140
    to $150 million on instruments to support new products and
    sales growth. Spending on other property, plant and equipment
    decreased in 2010 compared to the 2009 period as there were no
    significant infrastructure initiatives in 2010. During 2011, we
    expect to purchase approximately $110 to $120 million in
    other property, plant and equipment, reflecting the cash outlays
    necessary to complete new product-related investments and
    replacement of older machinery and equipment. Beginning in 2009
    and with more significance in 2010, we began investing some of
    our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated debt securities.
    The purchases and any sales or maturities of these investments
    are reflected as cash flows from investing activities. Acquired
    intellectual property rights decreased to $8.5 million in
    2010 compared to $35.8 million in 2009 and
    $109.4 million in 2008. These items relate to lump-sum
    payments made to certain healthcare professionals and
    institutions in place of future royalty payments that otherwise
    would have been due under the terms of existing contractual
    arrangements. These lump-sum payments were based upon a third
    party fair market valuation of the current net present value of
    the contractual arrangements. Included in investing cash flows
    in 2008 were $363.0 million paid to acquire Abbott Spine
    and $54.9 million of proceeds we received from the sale of
    certain equity securities. In the past three years, we have made
    other smaller business acquisitions including Beijing Montagne
    Medical Device Co., Ltd., Sodem Diffusion S.A. and foreign-based
    distributors.

Cash flows used in financing activities were $489.6 million
    for 2010, compared to $262.1 million in 2009. In 2010, the
    only significant cash we used in financing activities related to
    the repurchase of $505.6 million of our common stock. In
    November 2009, we sold $1.0 billion aggregate principal
    amount of senior unsecured notes (Senior Notes) in a public
    offering. We received net proceeds of approximately
    $998.8 million, net of an offering discount of
    $1.2 million. We also paid an additional $8.5 million
    of debt issuance costs related to the sale of the Senior Notes.
    We used cash from operating cash flows and some of the proceeds
    from the Senior Notes to repurchase $923.7 million of our
    common stock in 2009.

The Senior Notes include two tranches: $500 million
    aggregate principal amount of 4.625 percent Senior Notes
    due November 30, 2019, and $500 million aggregate
    principal amount of 5.75 percent Senior Notes due
    November 30, 2039. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable
    on May 30 and November 30 of each year until maturity.

We may redeem the Senior Notes at our election in whole or in
    part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal
    to the greater of 1) 100 percent of the principal
    amount of the notes being redeemed; or 2) the sum of the
    present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal
    and interest (not including any portion of such payments of

interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to
    the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury
    Rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 20 basis
    points, in the case of the 2019 notes, and 25 basis points,
    in the case of the 2039 notes. We will also pay the accrued and
    unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to the redemption date.

We have a five year $1,350 million revolving,
    multi-currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing
    November 30, 2012 (Senior Credit Facility). We had
    $141.8 million outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility
    at December 31, 2010, and an availability of
    $1,208.2 million.

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
    $77.8 million.

We place our cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial
    institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
    entity. We invest only in high-quality financial instruments in
    accordance with our internal investment policy.

As of December 31, 2010 we had short-term and long-term
    investments in debt securities with a fair value of
    $410.6 million. These investments are in debt securities of
    many different counterparties and therefore we have no
    significant concentration of risk with a single counterparty.
    All these debt securities are highly-rated and therefore we
    believe the risk of default by the counterparties is low.

As of December 31, 2010, $725.3 million of our cash
    and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments
    are held in jurisdictions outside of the U.S and expected to be
    indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations.
    Repatriation of these assets to the U.S. would have
    negative tax consequences. Approximately $550 million of
    this amount is denominated in U.S. Dollars and therefore
    bears no foreign currency translation risk. The remaining is
    denominated in the various currencies where we operate.

We may use excess cash to repurchase additional common stock
    under our share repurchase program. As of December 31,
    2010, approximately $1.2 billion remained authorized under
    a $1.5 billion repurchase program, which will expire on
    December 31, 2013.

Management believes that cash flows from operations and
    available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility are
    sufficient to meet our expected working capital, capital
    expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment
    opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet
    and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if
    necessary.

CONTRACTUAL
    OBLIGATIONS

We have entered into contracts with various third parties in the
    normal course of business that will require future payments. The

Approximately 8 percent of the other long-term liabilities
    on our balance sheet are liabilities related to defined benefit
    pension plans. Defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon
    the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not
    based upon future contributions. Due to uncertainties regarding
    future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our
    intentions on voluntary contributions, we are unable to
    reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2011. Therefore,
    this table does not include any amounts related to future
    contributions to our plans. See Note 14 to our consolidated
    financial statements for further information on our defined
    benefit plans.

Also included in other long-term liabilities on our balance
    sheet are liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits and
    corresponding interest and penalties thereon. Due to the
    uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the
    ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to
    reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax
    payments related to these positions will be made. Therefore,
    this table does not include any obligations related to uncertain
    tax benefits. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial
    statements for further information on these uncertain tax
    benefits.

We have entered into various contractual agreements that may
    result in future payments dependent upon various events such as
    the achievement of certain product R&D milestones, sales
    milestones, or at our discretion to maintain exclusive rights to
    distribute a product. Since there is uncertainty on the timing
    or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not
    included them in this table. These payments could range from $0
    to $60 million.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our financial results are affected by the selection and
    application of accounting policies and methods. Significant
    accounting policies which require management’s judgment are
    discussed below.

Excess Inventory and Instruments

– We must
    determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or
    unsaleable at our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also
    determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use
    or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are
    established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to
    net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of
    reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to
    historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our
    products and instrument systems and components. The basis for
    the determination is generally the same for all inventory and
    instrument items and categories except for

work-in-process

inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued
    items are generally destroyed and completely written off.
    Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves
    based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other
    factors on a regular basis.

Income Taxes

– Our income tax expense, deferred
    tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax
    benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated
    future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the
    U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant
    judgments and estimates are required in determining the
    consolidated income tax expense.

We estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and
    assets by taxable jurisdiction. Realization of deferred tax
    assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability
    to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the
    benefits. We evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis
    and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is
    “more likely than not” that the deferred tax benefit
    will be realized. Federal income taxes are provided on the
    portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected
    to be remitted to the U.S.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
    uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and
    regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global
    operations. We are subject to regulatory review or audit in
    virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and
    audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. We
    record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all
    relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws,
    our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status
    of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax
    authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial
    matters.

We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) guidance on income
    taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes
    as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously
    available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties,
    the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is
    materially different from our current estimate of the tax
    liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or
    decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are
    determined.

Commitments and Contingencies

– Accruals for
    product liability and other claims are established with the
    assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on
    current information and historical settlement information for
    claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not
    reported. We use an actuarial model to assist management in
    determining an appropriate level of accruals for product
    liability claims. Historical patterns of claim loss development
    over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which
    are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.

In addition to our general product liability, we have recorded
    “Certain claims” provisions totaling
    $179.0 million related to the

Durom

Cup, including
    $75.0 million in 2010. The additional provision was needed
    in 2010 in part because we revised the definition of
    “Certain claims” recorded in our statement of earnings
    to include worldwide claims relating to all revisions of

Durom

Cup cases where the original surgery was performed
    before our July 22, 2008 suspension of marketing and
    distribution, regardless of the time period elapsed between the
    original surgery and the revision surgery. This additional
    provision represents management’s updated estimate of
    liability to

Durom

Cup patients undergoing revisions
    associated with original surgeries occurring before
    July 22, 2008. The remaining liability as of
    December 31, 2010 is $132.8 million.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

– We evaluate
    the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible
    assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate
    the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the
    carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events
    or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate
    the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably
    estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such,
    these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable
    inputs. Changes to these assumptions could require us to record
    impairment charges on these assets.

As of December 31, 2010, we had intangible assets of
    $210.7 million related to trademarks and trade names, of
    which $197.3 million are classified as having an indefinite
    life. We currently have and anticipate future product
    development efforts that may replace the current products that
    use those trademarks and trade names. While it is possible, it
    is not known if these new products will utilize these trademarks
    and trade names. If these new products do not use these
    trademarks and trade names, these assets may be impaired.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined our U.S. Spine
    reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its
    estimated fair value. Fair value was determined using an equal
    weighting of income and market approaches. Fair value under the
    income approach was determined by discounting to present value
    the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. Fair
    value under the market approach utilized the comparable
    transaction methodology, which uses valuation indicators
    determined from sales of other businesses that are similar to
    our U.S. Spine reporting unit.

As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for the
    U.S. Spine reporting unit of $204.0 million during the
    year ended December 31, 2010. In the year ended
    December 31,



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

2009, we also recorded an impairment charge related to this
    reporting unit of $73.0 million. See Note 9 to our
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the
    factors that contributed to these impairment charges.

We have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to
    them. We estimate the fair value of those reporting units using
    the income approach by discounting to present value the
    estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. For each of
    those five reporting units, the estimated fair values
    substantially exceed their carrying value.

Share-based Payment

– We measure share-based
    payment expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the
    award and recognize expense over the requisite service period.
    Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant
    date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life
    of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock.
    Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share-based awards
    that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected
    volatility based upon the implied volatility of actively traded
    options on our stock. The expected life of stock options and
    estimated forfeitures are based upon our employees’
    historical exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions
    used in determining the grant date fair value and the expected
    forfeitures represent management’s best estimates.

RECENT ACCOUNTING
    PRONOUNCEMENTS

There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we
    have not yet adopted that are expected to have a material effect
    on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

MARKET
    RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing
    business operations, including risks from changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices
    that could affect our financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market
    risks through regular operating and financing activities and
    through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use
    derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools
    and not for speculative investment purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
    EXCHANGE RISK

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
    could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency
    exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets
    denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British
    Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won,
    Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South
    African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees. We manage the
    foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined basis, which
    allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural
    offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign currency exchange
    rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign
    currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in
    the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and
    options with major financial institutions. These forward
    contracts and options are designed to hedge anticipated foreign
    currency transactions, primarily intercompany sale and purchase
    transactions, for periods consistent with commitments. Realized
    and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts and options
    that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in
    other comprehensive income, then recognized in cost of products
    sold when the hedged item affects net earnings.

For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010, we had
    obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros,
    Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian
    Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht,
    Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian
    Rupees and purchase Swiss Francs and sell U.S. Dollars at
    set maturity dates ranging from January 2011 through June 2013.
    The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered
    into with third parties to purchase U.S. Dollars at
    December 31, 2010 were $1.4 billion. The notional
    amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered into with third
    parties to purchase Swiss Francs at December 31, 2010 were
    $212.1 million. The weighted average contract rates
    outstanding at December 31, 2010 were Euro:USD 1.35,
    USD:Swiss Franc 1.04, USD:Japanese Yen 87.20, British Pound:USD
    1.57, USD:Canadian Dollar 1.07, Australian Dollar:USD 0.82,
    USD:Korean Won 1,231, USD:Swedish Krona 7.32, USD:Czech Koruna
    19.57, USD:Thai Baht 31.27, USD:Taiwan Dollar 30.62,
    USD:South African Rand 7.85, USD:Russian Ruble 32.24 and
    USD:Indian Ruppee 48.08.

We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk
    management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms
    of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted
    transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges,
    changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are
    generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the
    fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management
    program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess
    potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and
    financial position relating to hypothetical movements in
    currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in
    the fair value of foreign currency exchange forward contracts
    outstanding at December 31, 2010 indicated that, if the
    U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent
    relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound,
    Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Korean Won, Swedish Krona,
    Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand,
    Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees, with no change in the interest
    differentials, the fair value of those contracts would increase
    or decrease earnings before income taxes in periods through
    2012, depending on the direction of the change, by an average
    approximate amount of $59.8 million, $19.8 million,
    $36.1 million, $11.3 million, $7.2 million,
    $12.6 million, $1.7 million, $2.3 million,
    $0.6 million, $0.6 million, $1.7 million,
    $0.5 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million,
    respectively. Any change in the fair value of foreign currency
    exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a
    currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a
    change in the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently,
    foreign currency exchange contracts would not subject us to
    material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and
    losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets,
    liabilities and transactions being hedged.

We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency
    denominated assets and liabilities of approximately
    $2,250 million at December 31, 2010, primarily in
    Euros and Japanese Yen. Approximately $1,295 million of the
    net asset exposure at December 31, 2010 relates to goodwill
    recorded in the Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary
    assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
    entity’s functional currency. As a result, foreign currency
    remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are generally
    offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency forward
    exchange contracts in the same reporting period.

COMMODITY PRICE
    RISK

We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome,
    titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into
    supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months,
    where available, on these commodities to alleviate



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

the effect of market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk
    management program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to
    potential commodity price changes. A 10 percent price
    change across all these commodities would not have a material
    effect on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

INTEREST RATE
    RISK

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk
    from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of
    operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to
    interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing
    activities.

We invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in
    highly-rated corporate commercial paper and bank deposits. We
    also have short-term and long-term investments in highly-rated
    corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency debt
    securities, U.S. government treasury funds, municipal
    bonds, foreign government debt securities, commercial paper and
    certificates of deposit. The primary investment objective is to
    ensure capital preservation of our invested principal funds.
    Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our
    investment portfolio.

We are exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and
    our cash and cash equivalents. Presently, all of our debt
    outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility bears interest at
    short-term rates.

In December 2010, we entered into interest rate swap agreements
    with a consolidated notional amount of $250 million that
    hedge a portion of our $500 million 4.625 percent
    Senior Notes due November 30, 2019. On the interest rate
    swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2010, we
    receive a fixed interest rate of 4.625 percent and we pay
    variable interest equal to the three-month LIBOR plus an average
    of 133 basis points.

The interest rate swap agreements are to manage our exposure to
    interest rate movements by converting fixed-rate debt into
    variable-rate debt. The objective of the instruments is to more
    closely align interest expense with interest income received on
    cash and cash equivalents.

These derivative instruments are designated as fair value hedges
    under U.S. GAAP. Changes in the fair value of the
    derivative instrument are recorded in earnings and are offset by
    gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument.

Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of
    December 31, 2010, a change of 10 percent in interest
    rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would
    not have a material effect on net interest expense. This
    analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level
    of overall economic activity that could exist in such an
    environment.

CREDIT
    RISK

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash and cash
    equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, derivative
    instruments, counterparty transactions and accounts receivable.

We place our investments in highly-rated financial institutions
    and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. We
    believe we do not have any significant credit risk on our cash
    and cash equivalents and investments.

We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with
    which we conduct business fail to perform. However, this loss is
    limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the
    counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our
    obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing
    with a diversified group of major financial institutions. We
    manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our
    counterparties using standard credit guidelines. We do not
    anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
    receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and
    their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by
    frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to
    whom credit is granted in the normal course of business.
    However, essentially all of our trade receivables are
    concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare
    industry in the U.S. and internationally or with
    distributors or dealers who operate in international markets
    and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business,
    economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent
    upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the
    respective countries’ national economic and healthcare
    systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit
    approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and we
    believe that reserves for losses are adequate. While we are
    exposed to risks from the broader healthcare industry where we
    do business, there is no significant net exposure due to any
    individual customer.

    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the company’s Board of Directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, the
    company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

.

Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2010, the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The company’s independent registered public accounting firm
    has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
    as stated in its report which appears in Item 8 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To The Stockholders and Board
    of Directors of Zimmer Holdings, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Zimmer
    Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
    financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control –
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
    on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BUSINESS

We design, develop, manufacture and market orthopaedic
    reconstructive, spinal and trauma devices, dental implants and
    related surgical products. We also provide other healthcare
    related services. Orthopaedic reconstructive devices restore
    function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as knees,
    hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive implants
    restore function and aesthetics in patients who have lost teeth
    due to trauma or disease. Spinal devices are utilized by
    orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the treatment of
    degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in all regions of
    the spine. Trauma products are devices used primarily to
    reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the
    body’s natural healing process. Our related surgical
    products include surgical supplies and instruments designed to
    aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation
    rehabilitation. We have operations in more than 25 countries and
    market our products in more than 100 countries. We operate in a
    single industry but have three reportable geographic segments,
    the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.

The words “we,” “us,” “our” and
    similar words refer to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

– The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Zimmer Holdings and
    its subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling equity
    position. Investments in companies in which we exercise
    significant influence over the operating and financial affairs,
    but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method.
    Under the equity method, we record the investment at cost and
    adjust the carrying amount of the investment by our
    proportionate share of the investee’s net earnings or
    losses. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
    are eliminated. Certain amounts in the 2009 and 2008
    consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
    conform to the 2010 presentation.

Use of Estimates

– The consolidated financial
    statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the U.S. which require us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

– The financial
    statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into
    U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and
    liabilities and average exchange rates for operating results.
    Unrealized translation gains and losses are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’
    equity. When a transaction is denominated in a currency other
    than the subsidiary’s functional currency, we recognize a
    transaction gain or loss when the transaction is settled.
    Foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in net
    earnings for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 were not significant.

Revenue Recognition

– We sell product through
    three principal channels: 1) direct to healthcare
    institutions, referred to as direct channel accounts;
    2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers;
    and 3) directly to dental practices and dental
    laboratories. The direct channel accounts represent
    approximately 80 percent of our net sales. Through this
    channel, inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or
    customers so that products are available when needed for
    surgical procedures. No revenue is recognized upon the placement
    of inventory into consignment as we retain title and maintain
    the inventory on our balance sheet. Upon implantation, we issue
    an invoice and revenue is recognized. Pricing for products is
    generally predetermined by contracts with customers, agents
    acting on behalf of customer groups or by government regulatory
    bodies, depending on the market. Price discounts under group
    purchasing contracts are generally linked to volume of implant
    purchases by customer healthcare institutions within a specified
    group. At negotiated thresholds within a contract buying period,
    price discounts may increase. Sales to stocking distributors,
    healthcare dealers, dental practices and dental laboratories
    account for approximately 20 percent of our net sales. With
    these types of sales, revenue is recognized when title to
    product passes, either upon shipment of the product or in some
    cases upon implantation of the product. Product is generally
    sold at contractually fixed prices for specified periods.
    Payment terms vary by customer, but are typically less than
    90 days. In some cases sales incentives may be earned by a
    customer for purchasing a specified amount of our product. We
    estimate whether such incentives will be achieved and, if so,
    recognize these incentives as a reduction in revenue in the same
    period the underlying revenue transaction is recognized.
    Occasionally products are returned, and, accordingly, we
    maintain an estimated sales return reserve that is recorded as a
    reduction in revenue. Product returns were not significant for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Taxes Collected from Customers

– Taxes
    collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities are presented on a net basis and excluded from
    revenues.

Shipping and Handling

– Amounts billed to
    customers for shipping and handling of products are reflected in
    net sales and are not significant. Expenses incurred related to
    shipping and handling of products are reflected in selling,
    general and administrative and were $129.1 million,
    $121.8 million and $117.3 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Research and Development

– We expense all
    research and development costs as incurred. Research and
    development costs include salaries, prototypes, depreciation of
    equipment used in research and development, consultant

fees and service fees paid to collaborative partners. Where
    contingent milestone payments are due to third parties under
    research and development arrangements, the milestone payment
    obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved.

Special Items

– We recognize expenses resulting
    directly from our business combinations and other items as
    “Special items” in our consolidated statement of
    earnings. Expenses in the “Special items” line for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, included (in

Adjustment or impairment of assets and obligations relates to
    impairment on assets that were acquired in business
    combinations, impairment of assets related to a transformation
    of our global information technology infrastructure or
    adjustments to certain liabilities of acquired companies due to
    changes in circumstances surrounding those liabilities
    subsequent to the related measurement period.

Consulting and professional fees relate to third-party
    integration consulting performed in a variety of areas such as
    tax, compliance, logistics and human resources for our business
    combinations and include third-party fees related to severance
    and termination benefits matters. These fees also include legal
    fees related to litigation matters involving acquired businesses
    that existed prior to our acquisition or resulted from our
    acquisition.

In 2010 and 2009, we terminated some employees as we reduced
    management layers, restructured certain areas, and commenced
    initiatives to focus on business opportunities that best support
    our strategic priorities. In 2010 and 2009, approximately 60 and
    300 employees, respectively, from across the globe were
    affected by these actions. As a result of these changes in our
    work force and headcount reductions from acquisitions, we
    incurred expenses related to severance benefits, redundant
    salaries as we worked through transition periods, share-based
    compensation acceleration and other employee termination-related
    costs. These termination benefits were provided in accordance
    with our existing or local government policies and are
    considered ongoing benefits. These costs were accrued when they
    became probable and estimable and were recorded as part of other
    current liabilities. The majority of these costs were paid
    during the year they were incurred.

Information technology integration relates to the
    non-capitalizable costs associated with integrating the
    information systems of acquired businesses.

In-process research and development charges for 2008 relate to
    the acquisition of Abbott Spine.

We ceased using certain leased facilities in 2010 and 2009 and,
    accordingly, recorded expense for the remaining lease payments,
    less estimated sublease recoveries, and wrote-off any assets
    being used in those facilities.

Facility and employee relocation relates to costs associated
    with relocating certain facilities as well as employee
    relocation resulting from our business combinations. Most
    notably, we consolidated our legacy European distribution
    centers into a new distribution center in Eschbach, Germany.

Over the past few years we have acquired a number of
    U.S. and foreign-based distributors. We have incurred
    various costs related to the acquisition and integration of
    those businesses.

Certain litigation matters relate to costs and adjustments
    recognized during the year for the estimated or actual
    settlement of various legal matters, including patent litigation
    matters, commercial litigation matters and matters arising from
    our acquisitions of certain competitive distributorships in
    prior years. We recognize expense for the potential settlement
    of a legal matter when we believe it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the loss. In 2009,
    we made a concerted effort to settle some of these matters to
    avoid further litigation costs.

Contract termination costs relate to terminated agreements in
    connection with the integration of acquired companies and
    changes to our distribution model as part of business
    restructuring and transformation. The terminated contracts
    primarily relate to sales agents and distribution agreements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

– We consider all
    highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
    months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts
    reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents are
    valued at cost, which approximates their fair value.

Investments

– We invest in debt securities to
    promote business and strategic objectives. Our investments
    include corporate debt securities, foreign government debt
    securities, U.S. agency debt securities and certificates of
    deposit and are classified and accounted for as

available-for-sale.

Available-for-sale

debt securities are recorded at fair value on our consolidated
    balance sheet. Investments with a contractual maturity of less
    than one year are classified as short-term investments on our
    consolidated balance sheet, or in other non-current assets if
    the contractual maturity is greater than one year. Changes in
    fair value for

(Continued)

available-for-sale

securities are recorded, net of taxes, as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance
    sheet. We review our investments for

other-than-temporary

impairment at each reporting period. If an unrealized loss for
    any investment is considered to be

other-than-temporary,

the loss will be recognized in the consolidated statement of
    earnings in the period the determination is made. See
    Note 7 for more information regarding our investments.

Accounts Receivable

– Accounts receivable
    consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables. We grant
    credit to customers in the normal course of business and
    maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit
    losses. We determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by
    geographic market and take into consideration historical credit
    experience, creditworthiness of the customer and other pertinent
    information. We make concerted efforts to collect all accounts
    receivable, but sometimes we have to write-off the account
    against the allowance when we determine the account is
    uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was
    $14.4 million and $18.8 million as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Inventories

– Inventories, net of allowances
    for obsolete and slow-moving goods, are stated at the lower of
    cost or market, with cost determined on a

first-in

first-out basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

– Property, plant
    and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
    estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and
    improvements and three to eight years for machinery and
    equipment. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. We
    review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss
    would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash
    flows relating to the asset are less than its carrying amount.
    An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the
    carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value.

Software Costs

– We capitalize certain computer
    software and software development costs incurred in connection
    with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use
    when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is
    probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized
    software costs generally include external direct costs of
    materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining
    computer software and compensation and related benefits for
    employees who are directly associated with the software project.
    Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and
    equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line
    basis when the software is ready for its intended use over the
    estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate three
    to ten years.

Instruments

– Instruments are hand-held devices
    used by surgeons during total joint replacement and other
    surgical procedures. Instruments are recognized as long-lived
    assets and are included in property, plant and equipment.
    Undeployed instruments are carried at cost, net of allowances
    for excess and obsolete instruments. Instruments in the field
    are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
    is computed using the straight-line method based on average
    estimated useful lives, determined principally in reference to
    associated product life cycles, primarily five years. We review
    instruments for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an instrument
    may not be recoverable. Depreciation of instruments is
    recognized as selling, general and administrative expense.

Goodwill

– Goodwill is not amortized but is
    subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill has been assigned
    to reporting units. We perform annual impairment tests by
    comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying
    amount to determine if there is potential impairment. The fair
    value of the reporting unit and the implied fair value of
    goodwill are determined based upon a discounted cash flow
    analysis. Significant assumptions are incorporated into these
    discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth rates and
    risk-adjusted discount rates. We perform this test in the fourth
    quarter of the year or whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting
    unit’s assets may not be recoverable. If the fair value of
    the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an
    impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair
    value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying
    value of the reporting unit goodwill. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 we recorded goodwill impairment
    charges of $204.0 million and $73.0 million,
    respectively, related to our U.S. Spine reporting unit. See
    Note 9 for more information regarding goodwill and goodwill
    impairment.

Intangible Assets

– Intangible assets are
    initially measured at their fair value. We have determined the
    fair value of our intangible assets either by the fair value of
    the consideration exchanged for the intangible asset or the
    estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected to be
    generated from the intangible asset. Intangible assets with an
    indefinite life, including certain trademarks and trade names,
    are not amortized. Indefinite life intangible assets are
    assessed annually to determine whether events and circumstances
    continue to support an indefinite life. Intangible assets with a
    finite life, including core and developed technology, certain
    trademarks and trade names, customer-related intangibles,
    intellectual property rights and patents and licenses are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
    life, ranging from less than one year to 40 years.
    Intangible assets with a finite life are tested for impairment
    whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with an
    indefinite life are tested for impairment annually or whenever
    events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
    not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the
    carrying



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. The amount
    of the impairment loss to be recorded would be determined based
    upon the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair
    value. The fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are
    determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis using the
    relief from royalty method. The relief from royalty method
    estimates the cost savings associated with owning, rather than
    licensing, assets. Significant assumptions are incorporated into
    these discounted cash flow analyses such as estimated growth
    rates, royalty rates and risk-adjusted discount rates.

In determining the useful lives of intangible assets, we
    consider the expected use of the assets and the effects of
    obsolescence, demand, competition, anticipated technological
    advances, changes in surgical techniques, market influences and
    other economic factors. For technology-based intangible assets,
    we consider the expected life cycles of products, absent
    unforeseen technological advances, which incorporate the
    corresponding technology. Trademarks and trade names that do not
    have a wasting characteristic (i.e., there are no legal,
    regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors
    which limit the useful life) are assigned an indefinite life.
    Trademarks and trade names that are related to products expected
    to be phased out are assigned lives consistent with the period
    in which the products bearing each brand are expected to be
    sold. For customer relationship intangible assets, we assign
    useful lives based upon historical levels of customer attrition.
    Intellectual property rights are assigned useful lives that
    approximate the contractual life of any related patent or the
    period for which we maintain exclusivity over the intellectual
    property.

Income Taxes

– We account for income taxes
    under the asset and liability method, which requires the
    recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
    expected future tax consequences of events that have been
    included in the financial statements. Under this method,
    deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
    differences between the financial statements and tax basis of
    assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the
    year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The
    effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes
    the enactment date.

We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these
    assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such
    determination, we consider all available positive and negative
    evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable
    temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax
    planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the
    event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our
    deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net
    recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation
    allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
    Federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income
    of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the
    U.S.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– We measure
    all derivative instruments at fair value and report them on our
    consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. We maintain
    written policies and procedures that permit, under appropriate
    circumstances and subject to proper authorization, the use of
    derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes.
    The use of derivative financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes is prohibited by our policy. See
    Note 13 for more information regarding our derivative and
    hedging activities.

Other Comprehensive Income

– Other
    comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and
    losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are
    included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net
    earnings as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment
    to stockholders’ equity. Other comprehensive income is
    comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments,
    unrealized foreign currency hedge gains and losses, unrealized
    gains and losses on

available-for-sale

securities and amortization of prior service costs and
    unrecognized gains and losses in actuarial assumptions.

Treasury Stock

– We account for repurchases of
    common stock under the cost method and present treasury stock as
    a reduction of stockholders’ equity. We reissue common
    stock held in treasury only for limited purposes.

Noncontrolling Interest

– On January 1,
    2009, we adopted the FASB’s newly issued guidance related
    to noncontrolling interests. This new guidance changes the
    accounting and reporting for minority interests, which are now
    recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
    component of equity. This new guidance requires retroactive
    adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for
    existing noncontrolling interests. This adoption did not have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements or
    results of operations. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, we acquired 100 percent ownership of our only
    outstanding noncontrolling interest for approximately
    $8.6 million. This purchase was recorded as an equity
    transaction and is reflected as a financing activity in our
    consolidated statement of cash flows. As a result, the carrying
    balance of the noncontrolling interests of $3.6 million was
    eliminated, and the remaining $5.0 million, representing
    the difference between the purchase price and carrying balance,
    was recorded as a reduction in paid-in capital. Transactions
    with noncontrolling interests had the following

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Our share-based payments primarily consist of stock options,

    respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    approximately $6.6 million and $9.4 million of
    capitalized costs remained in finished goods inventory.

Stock
    Options

We had two equity compensation plans in effect at
    December 31, 2010: the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (2009
    Plan) and the Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2009
    Plan succeeds the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (2006 Plan) and the
    TeamShare Stock Option Plan (TeamShare Plan). Following
    stockholder approval of the 2009 Plan in May 2009, no further
    awards were granted under the 2006 Plan or under the TeamShare
    Plan, and shares remaining available for grant under those plans
    are expected to be merged into the 2009 Plan. Vested and
    unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock and RSUs
    previously granted under the 2006 Plan, the TeamShare Plan and
    another prior plan, the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, remained
    outstanding as of December 31, 2010. We have reserved the
    maximum number of shares of common stock available for award
    under the terms of each of these plans. We have registered
    57.9 million shares of common stock. The 2009 Plan provides
    for the grant of nonqualified stock options and incentive stock
    options, long-term performance awards in the form of performance
    shares or units, restricted stock, RSUs and stock appreciation
    rights. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of
    the Board of Directors determines the grant date for annual
    grants under our equity compensation plans. The date for annual
    grants under the 2009 Plan to our executive officers is expected
    to occur in the first quarter of each year following the
    earnings announcements for the previous quarter and full year.
    The Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides for awards of
    stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to non-employee
    directors. It has been our practice to issue shares of common
    stock upon exercise of stock options from previously unissued
    shares. The total number of awards which may be granted in a
    given year

and/or

over
    the life of the plan under each of our equity compensation plans
    is limited. At December 31, 2010, an aggregate of
    11.9 million shares were available for future grants and
    awards under these plans.

Stock options granted to date under our plans generally vest
    over four years and generally have a maximum contractual life of
    10 years. As established under our equity compensation
    plans, vesting may accelerate upon retirement after the first
    anniversary date of the award if certain criteria are met. We
    recognize expense related to stock options on a straight-line
    basis over the requisite service period, less awards expected to
    be forfeited using estimated forfeiture rates. Due to the
    accelerated retirement provisions, the requisite service period
    of our stock options range from one to four years. Stock options
    are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of
    our common stock on the date of grant, except in limited
    circumstances where local law may dictate otherwise.

We use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the
    fair value of our stock options. Expected volatility was derived
    from the implied volatility of traded options on our stock that
    were actively traded around the grant date of the stock options
    with exercise prices similar to the stock options and maturities
    of over one year. The expected term of the stock options has
    been derived from historical employee exercise behavior. The
    risk-free interest rate is determined using the implied yield
    currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues
    with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the
    options. A dividend yield of zero percent has been used as we
    have not paid any dividends since becoming a public company in
    2001 and we do not expect to pay any dividends in the
    foreseeable future.

The weighted average fair value of the options granted in the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
    determined using the following assumptions:

The weighted average fair value for stock options granted during
    2010, 2009 and 2008 was $18.17, $16.02 and $23.32, respectively.
    The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was
    $8.5 million, $3.3 million and $31.9 million,
    respectively.

As of December 31, 2010, there was $63.4 million of
    unrecognized share-based payment expense related to nonvested
    stock options granted under our plans. That expense is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    2.2 years.

Performance
    Shares and RSUs

We have awarded both performance shares and RSUs to our
    employees. Some of these awards have had service conditions
    while others have had performance conditions. The terms of the
    service condition awards have been either two or five years with
    vesting occurring ratably on the anniversary date of the award.
    However, based upon meeting certain criteria, as established
    under our equity compensation plans, these awards may accelerate
    upon retirement after the first anniversary date of the award.
    Accordingly, the requisite service period used for share-based
    payment expense ranges from one to five years.

The last awards issued with performance conditions were to vest
    in 2008. However, for these performance condition awards it was
    determined in 2008 that the performance targets would not be
    achieved. Therefore, no performance condition awards are
    outstanding.

The fair value of the awards was determined based upon the fair
    market value of our common stock on the date of grant. We are
    required to estimate the number of RSUs that will vest and
    recognize share-based payment expense on a straight-line basis
    over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2010,
    we estimate that approximately 842,000 outstanding RSUs will
    vest. If our estimate were to change in the future, the
    cumulative effect of the change in estimate will be recorded in
    that period. Based upon the number of RSUs that we expect to
    vest, the unrecognized share-based payment expense as of
    December 31, 2010 was $30.2 million and is expected to
    be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.

ACQUISITIONS

We made a number of business acquisitions during the years 2010,
    2009 and 2008. In December 2010 we acquired Beijing Montagne
    Medical Device Co., Ltd. (Montagne) and Sodem Diffusion S.A.
    (Sodem). The Montagne acquisition makes us a leading provider of
    orthopaedic solutions in China and provides product lines
    tailored exclusively to the rapidly growing Chinese market. The
    Sodem acquisition broadens our portfolio of surgical power tools
    and strengthens our position in the approximate $1 billion
    surgical power tool market. In 2008 we acquired Abbott Spine,
    which provided us a number of innovative products and helped
    build critical mass in the spine market. Additionally, we have
    acquired a number of foreign-based distributors during the three
    year period.

The results of operations of the acquired companies have been
    included in our consolidated results of operations subsequent to
    the transaction dates, and the respective assets and liabilities
    of the acquired companies have been recorded at their estimated
    fair values in our consolidated statement of financial position
    as of the transaction dates, with any excess purchase price
    being allocated to goodwill. The estimated fair values of the
    Montagne and Sodem assets are preliminary. Pro forma financial
    information and other information required by the FASB’s
    guidance on business combinations have not been included as the
    acquisitions did not have a material impact upon our financial
    position or results of operations.

The unrealized losses on our investments in corporate debt
    securities were caused by increases in interest yields resulting
    from the current adverse conditions in the global credit
    markets. We believe the unrealized losses associated with our

available-for-sale

    do not intend to sell these investments, nor is it more likely
    than not that we will be required to sell them, before recovery

In 2010, goodwill relating to our U.S. Spine reporting unit
    with a carrying amount of $341.0 million was written down
    to its implied fair value of $137.0 million, resulting in
    an impairment charge of $204.0 million. The implied fair
    value of goodwill equals the estimated fair value of a reporting
    unit

    HOLDINGS, INC.

    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

minus the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets. In
    determining the implied fair value of the U.S. Spine
    reporting unit’s goodwill, we used unobservable inputs to
    estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and its assets and
    liabilities. Fair value was determined using an equal weighting
    of income and market approaches. Fair value under the income
    approach was determined by discounting to present value the
    estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. Fair value
    under the market approach utilized the comparable transaction
    methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from
    sales of other businesses that are similar to our
    U.S. Spine reporting unit. In estimating the future cash
    flows of the reporting unit, we utilized a combination of market
    and company specific inputs that a market participant would use
    in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. The primary
    market input was revenue growth rates. These rates were based
    upon historical trends and estimated future growth drivers such
    as an aging global population, obesity and more active
    lifestyles. Significant company specific inputs included
    assumptions regarding how the reporting unit could leverage
    operating expenses as revenue grows and the impact any new
    products will have on revenues. Under the comparable transaction
    methodology, we took into consideration when the comparable
    transaction occurred and the differences that may exist due to
    changes in the economic environment. We also took into
    consideration differences between the comparable companies and
    our U.S. Spine reporting unit that could affect fair value,
    such as cash and debt levels.

The fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and
    liabilities was determined by using the same methods that are
    used in business combination purchase accounting. See
    Note 9 for further information regarding this goodwill
    impairment.

In 2009, the implied fair value of goodwill was determined using
    the same methodologies utilized in the 2010 valuation.

There were no other significant nonfinancial assets that were
    measured at fair value in the years ended December 31, 2010
    and December 31, 2009.

We conduct our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of
    every year or whenever events occur or circumstances change that
    would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting
    unit below its carrying amount. During our 2009 and 2010 annual
    impairment tests, it was determined that our U.S. Spine
    reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its
    estimated fair value. Fair value was determined using an equal
    weighting of income and market approaches.

In the 2009 period, factors that contributed to the estimated
    fair value of the reporting unit being below its carrying value
    included a decrease in projected revenues related to the

Dynesys

Dynamic Stabilization System. This product line
    experienced increased competition and insurance reimbursement
    issues in 2009. We had been seeking approval from the FDA to
    market this product differently in the U.S., which would have
    enhanced its position in the market. However, in November 2009
    an FDA advisory panel issued a non-approvable recommendation,
    increasing the uncertainty of the estimated future cash flows at
    that time. In addition to the

Dynesys

product, revenues
    from other products had been affected as we worked through the
    integration of the sales channel following the Abbott Spine
    acquisition.

In the first quarter of 2010, our U.S. Spine reporting unit
    results were below our expectations so we performed an
    impairment test using similar methodologies to those used in
    2009. We determined at that time that goodwill was not

    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

impaired. In the second and third quarters of 2010, we did not
    perform impairment tests because our revenues and underlying
    cash flows were in line with our estimates from the first
    quarter.

As we completed our annual impairment testing in the fourth
    quarter of 2010, factors in the broader U.S. spine
    marketplace as well as company specific factors contributed to a
    further decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting
    unit. At the time of our 2009 impairment test, we estimated that
    the U.S. spine market was experiencing

year-over-year

revenue growth in the low double digits that would continue into
    the foreseeable future. Since the time of our 2009 test,

year-over-year

growth continued to decelerate and after multiple quarters of
    deceleration we estimated this may be a longer-term trend
    instead of a temporary phenomenon. In our fourth quarter 2010
    impairment test, we concluded that

year-over-year

growth had fallen to the low to mid single digits which we
    estimate to be the trend in the near-term. A portion of this
    decrease has come from lower pricing as hospitals try to reduce
    their costs.

Another factor in the lower growth trend includes increased
    scrutiny from insurance companies and continued discussion in
    the healthcare community on whether certain spine procedures are
    necessary. As an example, late in the third quarter of 2010 in
    one state an insurer provided notice that starting
    January 1, 2011, the insurer will require prior review and
    certification that the patient has met specific clinical
    criteria before the procedure will be covered. While revenues
    from these procedures in this one state are not significant to
    our overall revenues, it has caused uncertainty on whether more
    insurers may take similar actions.

As discussed above, we believe such deceleration and uncertainty
    as to revenue growth have decreased the valuations of other
    spine companies in the U.S. market and thus has affected
    our estimated fair value of our U.S. Spine reporting unit.

In addition, following the FDA advisory panel decision in
    November 2009 we continued to evaluate our regulatory options
    for marketing the

Dynesys

product differently. In 2010,
    we concluded that obtaining regulatory approval would take more
    time and cost more money than originally expected. This
    conclusion has also contributed to the decrease in our estimated
    fair value of the reporting unit.

As a result, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of
    $204.0 million and $73.0 million during the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

We have five other reporting units with goodwill assigned to
    them. We estimate the fair value of those reporting units using
    the income approach by discounting to present value the
    estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. For each of
    those five reporting units, the estimated fair value
    substantially exceeds its carrying value.

We will continue to monitor the fair value of our
    U.S. Spine reporting unit as well as our other five
    reporting units in our interim and annual reporting periods. If
    our estimated cash flows for these reporting units decrease, we
    may have to record further impairment charges in the future.
    Factors that could result in our cash flows being lower than our
    current estimates include: 1) decreased revenues caused by
    changes in the healthcare market, or our inability to generate
    new product revenue from our research and development
    activities, and 2) if we are not able to achieve the
    estimated operating margins in our forecasts due to unforeseen
    factors. Additionally, changes in the broader economic
    environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates,
    which will impact our estimated fair values.

In November 2009, we sold $500 million aggregate principal

    November 30, 2019 and $500 million aggregate principal
    amount of our 5.75 percent Senior Notes due
    November 30, 2039 (Senior Notes) in a public offering.
    Interest is payable on May 30 and November 30 of each year until
    maturity. We received net proceeds of approximately
    $998.8 million, net of an offering discount of
    $1.2 million. The Senior Notes carry an effective interest
    rate of 4.634 percent and 5.762 percent, respectively.
    The estimated fair value of our Senior Notes as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $1,022.0 million and
    $992.1 million, respectively.

We may redeem the Senior Notes at our election in whole or in
    part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal
    to the greater of 1) 100 percent of the principal
    amount of the notes being redeemed; or 2) the sum of the
    present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal
    and interest (not including any portion of such payments of
    interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to
    the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the Treasury
    Rate (as defined in the debt agreement), plus 20 basis
    points, in the case of the 2019 notes, and 25 basis points,
    in the case of the 2039 notes. We will also pay the accrued and
    unpaid interest on the Senior Notes to the redemption date.

In December 2010, we entered into interest rate swap agreements
    which we designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed
    rate obligations on our Senior Notes due 2019. We did not have
    any interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of
    December 31, 2009. See Note 13 for additional
    information regarding the interest rate swap agreements.

We have a five year $1,350 million senior credit agreement
    (Senior Credit Facility). The Senior Credit Facility is a
    revolving, multi-currency, senior unsecured credit facility
    maturing November 30, 2012. Available borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2010 were
    $1,208.2 million. The carrying value of the Senior Credit
    Facility approximates fair value, as the underlying instruments
    have variable interest rates at market value.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the
    borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus
    an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior
    unsecured long-term credit rating and the amounts drawn under
    the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a
    fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. The
    Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and
    negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured
    financing arrangement, including, among other things,
    limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
    Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to
    1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If we
    fall below an investment grade credit rating, additional
    restrictions would result, including restrictions on
    investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were
    in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit
    Facility as of December 31, 2010. Commitments under the
    Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a
    facility and a utilization fee.

DERIVATIVE
    INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We are exposed to certain market risks relating to our ongoing
    business operations, including foreign currency exchange rate
    risk, commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
    We manage our exposure to these and other market risks through
    regular operating and financing activities. Currently, the only
    risks that we manage through the use of derivative instruments
    are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Interest Rate
    Risk

Derivatives
    Designated as Fair Value Hedges

We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our
    exposure to interest rate movements by converting fixed-rate
    debt into variable-rate debt. Under these agreements, we agree
    to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between
    fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to
    an

agreed-upon

notional principal amount. The objective of the instruments is
    to more closely align interest expense with interest income
    received on cash and cash equivalents. These derivative
    instruments are designated as fair value hedges under
    U.S. GAAP. Changes in the fair value of the derivative
    instrument are recorded in current earnings and are offset by
    gains or losses on the underlying debt instrument.

In December 2010, we entered into five nine-year

fixed-to-variable

interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of
    $50 million each for a total notional amount of
    $250 million. These interest rate swap agreements were
    designated as fair value hedges of the fixed interest rate
    obligation under our $500 million 4.625 percent Senior
    Notes due November 30, 2019. On the interest rate swap
    agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2010, we receive
    a fixed interest rate of 4.625 percent and pay variable
    interest equal to the three-month LIBOR plus an average of
    133 basis points. We did not have any interest rate swap
    agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2009.

Derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges had the
    following effects on our consolidated statement of earnings for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 (in millions):

We had no ineffective fair value hedging instruments during the

Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rate Risk

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
    could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates. To reduce the potential effects of foreign
    currency exchange rate movements on net earnings, we enter into
    derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency
    exchange forward contracts and options with major financial
    institutions. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency
    exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets
    denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British
    Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won,
    Swedish Krona, Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South
    African Rand, Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees. We do not use
    derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
    purposes.

Derivatives
    Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

Our revenues are generated in various currencies throughout the
    world. However, a significant amount of our inventory is
    produced in U.S. Dollars. Therefore, movements in foreign
    currency exchange rates may have different proportional effects
    on our revenues compared to our cost of products sold. To
    minimize the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements
    on cash flows, we hedge intercompany sales of inventory expected
    to occur within the next 30 months with foreign currency
    exchange forward contracts and options. We designate these
    derivative instruments as cash flow hedges.

(Continued)

We perform quarterly assessments of hedge effectiveness by
    verifying and documenting the critical terms of the hedge
    instrument and that forecasted transactions have not changed
    significantly. We also assess on a quarterly basis whether there
    have been adverse developments regarding the risk of a
    counterparty default. For derivatives which qualify as hedges of
    future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair
    value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and
    then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item
    affects net earnings. The ineffective portion of a
    derivative’s change in fair value, if any, is reported in
    cost of products sold immediately. The net amount recognized in
    earnings during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008 due to ineffectiveness and amounts excluded from the
    assessment of hedge effectiveness was not significant.

For forward contracts and options outstanding at
    December 31, 2010, we have obligations to purchase
    U.S. Dollars and sell Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds,
    Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Korean Won, Swedish Krona,
    Czech Koruna, Thai Baht, Taiwan Dollars, South African Rand,
    Russian Rubles and Indian Rupees and purchase Swiss Francs and
    sell U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from
    January 2011 through June 2013. As of December 31, 2010,
    the notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts and
    options entered into with third parties to purchase
    U.S. Dollars were $1.4 billion. As of
    December 31, 2010, the notional amounts of outstanding
    forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase
    Swiss Francs were $212.1 million.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges had the
    following effects on other comprehensive income (OCI) on our
    consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of
    earnings on a gross basis for the years ended December 31,
    2010 and 2009 (in millions):

The fair value of outstanding derivative instruments designated
    as cash flow hedges and recorded on the balance sheet at
    December 31, 2010, together with settled derivatives where
    the hedged item has not yet affected earnings, was a net
    unrealized loss of $20.6 million, or $4.0 million
    after taxes, which is deferred in other comprehensive income, of
    which a loss of $6.4 million, or a gain of
    $2.4 million after taxes, is expected to be reclassified to
    earnings over the next twelve months.

Derivatives Not
    Designated as Hedging Instruments

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    terms of one month to manage currency exposures for monetary
    assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
    entity’s functional currency. As a result, any foreign
    currency remeasurement gains/losses recognized in earnings are
    generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period. These
    offsetting gains/losses are recorded in cost of products sold as
    the underlying assets and liabilities exposed to remeasurement
    include inventory-related transactions. These contracts are
    settled on the last day of each reporting period. Therefore,
    there is no outstanding balance related to these contracts
    recorded on the balance sheet as of the end of the reporting
    period. The notional amounts of these contracts are typically in
    a range of $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion per quarter.

The following gains/(losses) from these derivative instruments
    were recognized in cost of products sold on our consolidated

RETIREMENT
    BENEFIT PLANS

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain
    U.S. and Puerto Rico employees. The employees who are not
    participating in the defined benefit plans receive additional
    benefits under our defined contribution plans. Plan benefits are
    primarily based on years of credited service and the
    participant’s average eligible compensation. In addition to
    the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit pension plans, we
    sponsor various

non-U.S. pension

arrangements, including retirement and termination benefit plans
    required by local law or coordinated with government sponsored
    plans.

We use a December 31 measurement date for our benefit plans.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on
    the historical and estimated future rates of return on the
    different asset classes held in the plans. The expected
    long-term rate of return is the weighted average of the target
    asset allocation of each individual asset class. We believe that
    historical asset results approximate expected market returns
    applicable to the funding of a long-term benefit obligation.

Discount rates were determined for each of our defined benefit
    retirement plans at their measurement date to reflect the yield
    of a portfolio of high quality bonds matched against the timing
    and amounts of projected future benefit payments.

The U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement
    plans’ overall investment strategy is to maximize total
    returns by emphasizing long-term growth of capital while
    avoiding risk. We have established target ranges of assets held
    by the plans of 45 to 50 percent for equity securities, 45
    to 50 percent for debt securities and 5 to 10 percent
    in non-traditional investments. The plans strive to have
    sufficiently diversified assets so that adverse or unexpected
    results from one asset class will not have an unduly detrimental
    impact on the entire portfolio. The investments in the plans may
    be rebalanced quarterly based upon the target asset allocation
    of the plans.

In the U.S. and Puerto Rico, we maintain an investment
    policy statement that guides the investment allocation in the
    plans. The investment policy statement describes the target
    asset allocation positions described above. We have a benefits
    committee to monitor compliance with the investment policy
    statement and manage the general investment strategy and
    objectives of the plans. The benefits committee meets quarterly
    to review performance and to ensure that the current investment
    allocation is within the guidelines set forth in the investment
    policy statement.

The investment strategies of

non-U.S. based

plans vary according to the plan provisions and local laws. The
    majority of the assets in

non-U.S. based

plans are located in Switzerland based plans. These assets are
    held in trusts and are commingled with the assets of other Swiss
    companies with representatives of all the companies making the
    investment decisions. The overall strategy is to maximize total
    returns while avoiding risk. The trustees of the assets have
    established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 30 to
    50 percent in debt securities, 20 to 37 percent in
    equity

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our defined benefit
    pension plans’ assets did not hold any direct investment in
    Zimmer Holdings common stock.

Equity securities are valued using a market approach, based on
    quoted prices for the specific security from transactions in
    active exchange markets (Level 1), or in some cases where
    we are invested in mutual or collective funds, based upon the
    net asset value per unit of the fund which is determined from
    quoted market prices of the underlying securities in the
    fund’s portfolio (Level 2). Fixed income securities
    are valued using a market approach, based upon quoted prices for
    the specific security or from institutional bid evaluations.
    Some fixed income securities are in funds with a net asset value
    per unit which is determined using similar techniques for the
    underlying securities in the fund’s portfolio. Real estate
    is valued by discounting to present value the cash flows
    expected to be generated by the specific properties.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning
    and ending balances of our

non-U.S. pension

plan assets measured at fair value that used significant

We expect that we will have no legally required minimum funding
    requirements in 2011 for the qualified U.S. and Puerto Rico
    defined benefit retirement plans. We expect to voluntarily
    contribute between $35 million and $50 million to
    these plans during 2011. Contributions to

non-U.S. defined

benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $15 million
    in 2011. We do not expect the plan assets in any of our plans to
    be returned to us in the next year.

Defined
    Contribution Plans

We also sponsor defined contribution plans for substantially all
    of the U.S. and Puerto Rico employees and certain employees
    in other countries. The benefits offered under these plans are
    reflective of local customs and practices in the countries
    concerned. We expensed $24.4 million, $21.6 million
    and $17.1 million related to these plans for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Postretirement
    Benefit Plans

During 2009, we amended the postretirement healthcare benefit
    plans for certain U.S. and Puerto Rico employees.
    Participants in the plans between the ages of 55 and 65 who were
    previously receiving benefits will continue to receive benefits
    until reaching the age of 65. For all other participants in the
    plans, no benefits will be paid after January 1, 2010.
    Additionally, we contributed approximately $7 million to a
    Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust
    to settle any future obligations. We recognized a curtailment
    gain and settlement loss related to these actions.

The components of net periodic expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 for our unfunded
    postretirement benefit plans are as follows (in millions):

Our operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland and the State of
    Indiana benefit from various tax incentive grants. Unless these
    grants are extended, they will expire between fiscal years 2016
    and 2019.

During the third quarter of 2008, we reached an agreement with
    the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) confirming the
    deductibility of a portion of a payment we made to the
    U.S. government to settle certain claims and recorded a tax
    benefit of $31.7 million.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
    used for income tax purposes. We have established valuation
    allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected
    future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the
    deduction or credit.

The net operating loss carryovers are available to reduce future
    federal, state and foreign taxable earnings. At
    December 31, 2010, these net operating loss carryovers
    generally expire within a period of 1 to 20 years.
    Valuation allowances for net operating loss carryovers have been
    established in the amount of $14.6 million and
    $13.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The tax credit carryovers are available to offset
    future federal, state and foreign tax liabilities. At
    December 31, 2010, these tax credit carryovers generally
    expire within a period of 1 to 10 years. We have
    established valuation allowances for certain tax credit
    carryovers in the amount of $17.5 million and
    $17.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The remaining valuation allowances of
    $7.8 million and $6.2 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively, relate primarily to potential
    capital losses. We have established valuation allowances related
    to certain business combination transactions through goodwill.
    These allowances were approximately $13.3 million and
    $14.5 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

At December 31, 2010, we had an aggregate of approximately
    $2,191 million of unremitted earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries that have been, or are intended to be, indefinitely
    reinvested for continued use in foreign operations. If the total
    undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted, a
    significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the
    allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practical for us to
    determine the additional tax of remitting these earnings.

    of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at
    December 31, 2010 are $112.2 million of tax benefits
    that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. We decreased
    interest and penalties by $5.8 million during 2010, and as
    of December 31, 2010, had recognized a liability for
    interest and penalties of $22.8 million. During 2009, we
    accrued interest and penalties of $5.7 million, and as of
    December 31, 2009, had recognized a liability for interest
    and penalties of $28.6 million. During 2008, we accrued
    interest and penalties of $3.3 million, and as of
    December 31, 2008, had recognized a liability for interest
    and penalties of $22.9 million.

We operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and
    outside the U.S. and are currently under audit in numerous
    federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, we expect
    that the net amount of tax liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits will change in the next twelve

(Continued)

months due to changes in audit status, expiration of statutes of
    limitations and other events which could impact our
    determination of unrecognized tax benefits. Currently, we cannot
    reasonably estimate the amount by which our unrecognized tax
    benefits will change.

During the third quarter of 2009 we settled various tax matters
    with the IRS for all years prior to 2005. Our U.S. federal
    returns for years 2005 through 2007 are currently under IRS
    examination. In January 2011, the IRS issued a Notice of
    Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) for tax years 2006 and 2007. The NOPA
    relates to intercompany pricing between certain of our
    U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. We believe that we have
    followed applicable U.S. tax laws and will vigorously
    defend our income tax positions. However, the ultimate
    settlement with the IRS related to these proposed adjustments
    could have a material impact on our income tax expense and net
    earnings.

State income tax returns are generally subject to examination
    for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective
    return. The state impact of any federal changes generally
    remains subject to examination by various states for a period of
    up to one year after formal notification to the states. We have
    various state income tax returns in the process of examination,
    administrative appeals or litigation.

Our tax returns are currently under examination in various
    foreign jurisdictions. Foreign jurisdictions have statutes of
    limitations generally ranging from 3 to 5 years. Years
    still open to examination by foreign tax authorities in major
    jurisdictions include: Australia (2004 onward), Canada (2004
    onward), France (2008 onward), Germany (2005 onward), Ireland
    (2008 onward), Italy (2006 onward), Japan (2004 onward), Korea
    (2005 onward), Puerto Rico (2005 onward), Singapore (2004
    onward), Switzerland (2009 onward), and the United Kingdom (2009
    onward).

CAPITAL STOCK AND
    EARNINGS PER SHARE

We are authorized to issue 250 million shares of preferred
    stock, none of which were issued or outstanding as of
    December 31, 2010.

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is
    net earnings available to common stockholders. The denominator
    for basic earnings per share is the weighted average number of
    common shares outstanding during the period. The denominator for
    diluted earnings per share is weighted average shares
    outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options
    and other equity awards. The following is a reconciliation of
    weighted average shares for the basic and diluted share
    computations for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

For the year ended December 31, 2010, an average of
    13.7 million options to purchase shares of common stock
    were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
    share as the exercise prices of these options were greater than
    the average market price of the common stock. For the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, an average of
    14.3 million and 11.2 million options, respectively,
    were not included.

During 2010, we repurchased 9.1 million shares of our
    common stock at an average price of $55.26 per share for a total
    cash outlay of $505.6 million, including commissions. As of
    December 31, 2010, approximately $1.2 billion remained
    authorized under a $1.5 billion repurchase program, which
    will expire on December 31, 2013.

SEGMENT
    DATA

We design, develop, manufacture and market orthopaedic
    reconstructive implants, dental implants, spinal implants,
    trauma products and related surgical products which include
    surgical supplies and instruments designed to aid in surgical
    procedures and post-operation rehabilitation. We also provide
    other healthcare-related services. Revenue related to these
    services currently represents less than 1 percent of our
    total net sales. We manage operations through three major
    geographic segments – the Americas, which is comprised
    principally of the U.S. and includes other North, Central
    and South American markets; Europe, which is comprised
    principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and African
    markets; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan
    and includes other Asian and Pacific markets. This structure is
    the basis for our reportable segment information discussed
    below. Management evaluates reportable segment performance based
    upon segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses
    pertaining to share-based payment expense, inventory

step-up,

“Certain claims”, goodwill impairment, “Special
    items”, net curtailment and settlement and global
    operations and corporate functions. Global operations include
    research, development engineering, medical education, brand
    management, corporate legal, finance, and human resource
    functions, U.S. and Puerto Rico-based manufacturing
    operations and logistics and intangible amortization resulting
    from business combination accounting. Intercompany transactions
    have been eliminated from segment operating profit. Management
    reviews accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and
    equipment, goodwill and intangible assets by reportable segment
    exclusive of U.S. and Puerto Rico-based manufacturing operations
    and logistics and corporate assets.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES

Product
    Liability-Related Claims

We are subject to product liability claims arising in the
    ordinary course of our business. We establish standard accruals
    for product liability claims in conjunction with outside counsel
    based on current information and historical settlement
    information for open claims, related legal fees and claims
    incurred but not reported. These standard product liability
    accruals are recognized in selling, general and administrative
    expense. We may also establish provisions for certain product
    liability claims outside of the standard accruals that are
    recorded separately on our statement of earnings, such as the
    provision for claims related to the

Durom

®

Acetabular Component (

Durom

Cup) discussed below. We
    maintain insurance, subject to self-insured retention
    requirements, for losses from these and other claims.

On July 22, 2008, we temporarily suspended marketing and
    distribution of the

Durom

Cup in the
    U.S. Subsequently, a number of product liability lawsuits
    and other claims have been asserted against us. We have settled
    some of these claims and the others are still pending.
    Additional claims may be asserted in the future.

We recorded a provision of $69.0 million in 2008 as
    “Certain claims” on our statement of earnings
    representing our estimate of the

Durom

Cup-related claims
    we expected to be made for revision surgeries occurring within
    two years of the original surgery. In 2009, based on claims
    information received after our initial estimate, we increased
    our estimate of the number of claims for revision surgeries
    occurring within two years of the original surgery and,
    accordingly, increased the “Certain claims” provision
    by $35.0 million. In the second quarter of 2010, based on
    more recent claims information available and after consultation
    with an independent actuary, we revised our estimate to include
    all claims for revisions of original surgeries performed before
    July 22, 2008 on a worldwide basis, regardless of the
    amount of time between the revision surgery and the original
    surgery. As a result, we increased the “Certain
    claims” provision by $75.0 million, for a total of
    $179.0 million.

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 we
    recorded $10.9 million, $24.6 million and
    $7.2 million, respectively, as part of our standard product
    liability accruals for worldwide claims relating to revisions of

Durom

Cup cases where the revisions had occurred, or were
    estimated to occur, more than two years after the original
    surgery. Beginning with the second quarter of 2010, any
    additional provisions for such

    HOLDINGS, INC.


FORM 10-K

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

claims are recorded as part of the “Certain claims”
    accrual, as described above.

We will continue to record any provisions for claims relating to

Durom

Cup cases where the original surgery was performed
    after July 22, 2008 as part of our standard product
    liability accruals. As of December 31, 2010, we have
    recorded provisions totaling $6.0 million for such
    post-suspension claims.

Our estimate as of December 31, 2010 of the remaining
    liability for all

Durom

Cup-related claims relating to
    original surgeries performed before July 22, 2008 is
    $132.8 million, of which $42.5 million is classified
    as short-term in “Other current liabilities” and
    $90.3 million is classified as long-term in “Other
    long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet.
    We expect to pay the majority of the

Durom

Cup-related
    claims within the next three years.

We rely on significant estimates in determining the provisions
    for

Durom

Cup-related claims, including the number of
    claims that we will receive and the average amount we will pay
    per claim. The actual number of claims that we receive and the
    average amount we pay per claim may differ from our estimates,
    which could result in further changes to the provision.

On August 20, 2008, Margo and Daniel Polett filed an action
    against us and an unrelated third party, Public Communications,
    Inc. (PCI), in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia,
    Pennsylvania seeking an unspecified amount of damages for
    injuries and loss of consortium allegedly suffered by
    Mrs. Polett and her spouse, respectively. The complaint
    alleged that defendants were negligent in connection with
    Mrs. Polett’s participation in a promotional video
    featuring one of our knee products. The case was tried in
    November 2010 and the jury returned a verdict in favor of
    plaintiffs. The jury awarded $27.6 million in compensatory
    damages and apportioned fault 30 percent to plaintiffs,
    34 percent to us and 36 percent to PCI. Under
    applicable law, we may be liable for any portion of the damages
    apportioned to PCI that it does not pay. The trial court has not
    yet entered a judgment on the verdict. On December 2, 2010,
    we and PCI filed a Motion for Post-Trial Relief seeking a
    judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a new trial or a
    remittitur. That motion is pending. If our post-trial motion is
    unsuccessful, we intend to appeal the verdict and will be
    required to post a bond for the verdict amount plus interest. We
    do not believe the facts and evidence support the jury’s
    verdict. We have not recorded any charge relating to this matter
    in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended
    December 31, 2010, because we believe we have strong
    arguments for reversing the jury verdict, either before the
    trial court or on appeal. As a result, we do not believe that it
    is probable that we have incurred a liability consistent with
    the verdict and we cannot reasonably estimate any loss that
    might eventually be incurred. Although we believe we have strong
    grounds to reverse the jury’s verdict, the ultimate
    resolution of this matter is uncertain. We could in the future
    be required to record a charge to our consolidated statement of
    earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations in any particular period.

Intellectual
    Property-Related Claims

We are subject to claims of patent infringement and other
    intellectual property-related claims and lawsuits in the
    ordinary course of our business. We maintain insurance, subject
    to self-insured retention requirements, for losses from these
    and other claims.

On February 15, 2005, Howmedica Osteonics Corp. filed an
    action against us and an unrelated party in the
    U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging
    infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934; 6,372,814;
    6,664,308; and 6,818,020. On June 13, 2007, the Court
    granted our motion for summary judgment on the invalidity of the
    asserted claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934; 6,372,814;
    and 6,664,308 by ruling that all of the asserted claims are
    invalid for indefiniteness. On August 19, 2008, the Court
    granted our motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of
    certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,818,020, reducing
    the number of claims at issue in the suit to five. On
    April 9, 2009, in response to our earlier petition, the
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) instituted
    re-examination proceedings against U.S. Patent
    No. 6,818,020. The USPTO rejected all previously issued
    claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,818,020 as being
    unpatentable in light of one or more prior art references. On
    September 30, 2009, the Court issued an order staying
    proceedings in the litigation pending the outcome of the
    re-examination process. Subsequent to that stay order, Howmedica
    filed a motion seeking to certify an appeal of the summary
    judgment ruling on the ’934, ’814 and ’308
    patents. That motion was granted on January 13, 2010. On
    October 13, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s ruling on the
    invalidity of the asserted claims of the ’934, ’814
    and ’308 patents. On November 12, Howmedica filed a
    petition for a re-hearing en banc, which was denied on
    December 14, 2010. The case otherwise remains stayed
    pending the USPTO’s re-examination of the ’020 patent.
    We continue to believe that our defenses against infringement
    are valid and meritorious, and we intend to continue to defend
    this lawsuit vigorously.

While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these
    lawsuits and claims with any certainty, we believe that the
    liability, if any, resulting from these claims will not have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
    results of operations or cash flows.

Government
    Investigations

In September 2007, we and other orthopaedic companies settled a
    U.S. government investigation pertaining to consulting
    contracts, professional services agreements and other agreements
    by which remuneration is provided to orthopaedic surgeons. As
    part of the settlement, we entered

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Continued)

into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of
    Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
    (OIG-HHS). Under the CIA, which has a term expiring in 2012, we
    agreed, among other provisions, to continue the operation of our
    enhanced Corporate Compliance Program, designed to promote
    compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. We also
    agreed to retain an independent review organization to perform
    annual reviews to assist us in assessing our compliance with the
    obligations set forth in the CIA to ensure that arrangements we
    enter into do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute
    (42 U.S.C.

§ 1320a-7b).

A material breach of the CIA may subject us to exclusion by
    OIG-HHS from participation in all federal healthcare programs,
    which would have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations and cash flows.

In November 2007, we received a civil investigative demand from
    the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office seeking
    additional information regarding our financial relationships
    with a number of Massachusetts healthcare providers. We received
    a similar inquiry from the Oregon Attorney General’s office
    in October 2008. We are cooperating fully with the investigators
    with regard to these matters.

In September 2007, the Staff of the U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission (SEC) informed us that it was conducting an
    investigation regarding potential violations of the Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in the sale of medical devices in a
    number of foreign countries by companies in the medical device
    industry. In November 2007, we received a letter from the
    U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting that any
    information provided to the SEC also be provided to the DOJ on a
    voluntary basis. We are continuing to provide information and
    cooperate fully with the SEC and the DOJ. In the course of
    continuing dialogues with the agencies, we have voluntarily
    disclosed information to the SEC and DOJ relating to sales of
    our products by independent distributors in two South American
    countries. We cannot currently predict the outcome of the
    investigation or the impact of our voluntary disclosures to the
    authorities.

Putative
    Class Actions

On August 5, 2008, a complaint was filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana,
    Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union 719 Pension Fund v.
    Zimmer Holdings, Inc., et al., naming us and two of our
    executive officers as defendants. The complaint related to a
    putative class action on behalf of persons who purchased our
    common stock between January 29, 2008 and July 22,
    2008. The complaint alleged that the defendants violated the
    federal securities law by allegedly failing to disclose
    developments relating to our orthopaedic surgical products
    manufacturing operations in Dover, Ohio and the

Durom

Cup. The plaintiff sought unspecified damages and interest,
    attorneys’ fees, costs and other relief. On
    December 24, 2008, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated
    complaint that alleged the same claims and related to the same
    time period. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
    consolidated complaint on February 23, 2009. On
    December 1, 2009, the Court granted defendants’ motion
    to dismiss, without prejudice. On January 15, 2010, the
    plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend the consolidated
    complaint. On January 28, 2011, the Court denied the
    plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend the consolidated
    complaint and dismissed the case. The plaintiff has 30 days
    to file a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
    the Seventh Circuit. We believe this lawsuit is without merit,
    and we and the individual defendants intend to defend it
    vigorously.

On November 20, 2008, a complaint was filed in the
    U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,
    Dewald v. Zimmer Holdings, Inc., et al., naming us and
    certain of our current and former directors and employees as
    defendants. The complaint relates to a putative class action on
    behalf of all persons who were participants in or beneficiaries
    of our U.S. or Puerto Rico Savings and Investment Programs
    (plans) between October 5, 2007 and the date of filing and
    whose accounts included investments in our common stock. The
    complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants
    breached their fiduciary duties in violation of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, by
    continuing to offer Zimmer stock as an investment option in the
    plans when the stock purportedly was no longer a prudent
    investment and that defendants failed to provide plan
    participants with complete and accurate information sufficient
    to advise them of the risks of investing their retirement
    savings in Zimmer stock. The plaintiff seeks an unspecified
    monetary payment to the plans, injunctive and equitable relief,
    attorneys’ fees, costs and other relief. On
    January 23, 2009, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint
    that alleges the same claims and clarifies that the class period
    is October 5, 2007 through September 2, 2008. The
    defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on
    March 23, 2009. The motion to dismiss is pending with the
    court. On June 12, 2009, the U.S. Judicial Panel on
    Multidistrict Litigation entered an order transferring the
    Dewald case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern
    District of Indiana for coordinated or consolidated pretrial
    proceedings with the Plumbers & Pipefitters Local
    Union 719 Pension Fund case referenced above. We believe this
    lawsuit is without merit, and we and the individual defendants
    intend to defend it vigorously.

    related to prior periods that reduced net earnings by
    $5.0 million. The adjustments increased operating expenses
    by $2.9 million and increased the provision for income
    taxes by $2.1 million. We assessed the effects of these
    adjustments had they been made in prior periods to be immaterial.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures and
    internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable
    assurance that material information relating to us, including
    our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known on a timely basis
    to management and the Board of Directors. However, no control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are
    met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within a company have been detected.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
    of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that
    evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as
    of the end of the period covered by this report are effective.

There was no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred
    during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
    Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting appears in this report at the conclusion of
    Part II, Item 7A.

Other Information

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors was not asked to and did not approve the
    engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent
    registered public accounting firm, to perform any non-audit
    services. This disclosure is made pursuant to
    Section 10A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    as added by Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

    “Proposal No. 1: Election of Directors” in
    our definitive Proxy Statement for the annual meeting of
    stockholders to be held on May 2, 2011 (the “2011

    incorporated by reference from the section entitled
    “Committees of the Board” in our 2011 Proxy Statement.
    Information regarding the procedures by which stockholders may
    recommend nominees to the Board of Directors is incorporated by
    reference from the section entitled “Corporate
    Governance — Nominations for Directors” in our
    2011 Proxy Statement. Information regarding our executive
    officers is set forth in Item 1 of Part I of this
    report under the caption “Executive Officers.”
    Information about compliance with Section 16(a) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is incorporated by reference
    from the section entitled “Section 16(a) Beneficial
    Ownership Reporting Compliance” in our 2011 Proxy Statement.

We have adopted the Zimmer Code of Ethics for Chief Executive
    Officer and Senior Financial Officers (the “finance code of
    ethics”), a code of ethics that applies to our Chief
    Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting
    Officer and Corporate Controller, and other finance organization
