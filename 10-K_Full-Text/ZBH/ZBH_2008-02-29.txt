ANNUAL REPORT

PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

OVERVIEW

We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture
    and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants, including
    joint and dental, spinal implants, trauma products and related
    orthopaedic surgical products. We also provide other healthcare
    related services. In this report, “Zimmer”
    “we”, “us”, “our” and similar
    words refer collectively to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

There were several developments in 2007 that we expect will have
    a significant impact on our business for the foreseeable future.

In April 2007, we acquired Endius Incorporated, a privately held
    spinal products company based in Massachusetts. Endius develops
    and manufactures minimally invasive spine surgery products,
    implants and techniques to treat spine disease. The acquisition
    of Endius has expanded our spine product portfolio to include
    innovative minimally invasive instruments and implants.

In May 2007, the Board of Directors promoted two of our senior
    executives to the offices of chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer. This is the first time since we became an
    independent public company that new persons are holding those
    offices.

In September 2007, we and other major U.S. orthopaedic
    manufacturers announced a settlement reached with the
    U.S. Department of Justice regarding its ongoing
    investigation of financial relationships with consulting
    surgeons. As part of that settlement, we paid a
    $169.5 million civil settlement amount in the third quarter
    and entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
    (“DPA”) and a Corporate Integrity Agreement
    (“CIA”). As part of these agreements, we agreed to
    oversight by a federal monitor for 18 months and an
    independent review organization for an additional 42 months. We
    believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the
    requirements of the DPA and CIA. As recently announced, we
    intend to further expand our compliance program beyond the
    requirements of these agreements to enhance our ability to
    compete in an increasingly transparent and regulated environment.

In November 2007, we acquired ORTHOsoft Inc., a leader in
    computer navigation for orthopaedic surgery. The ORTHOsoft
    acquisition bolsters our

Zimmer

SmartTools strategic
    initiative designed to bring innovative tools to the marketplace
    that will help create better and more reproducible outcomes for
    surgeons and patients.

We anticipate further applying both minimally invasive and
    computer navigation concepts across our range of businesses.
    During 2007, we expanded our

Gender
    Solutions

®

platform to additional knee replacement systems and to hip
    replacement. We have also announced our intention to make
    additional investments in the higher growth areas of spine and
    dental products.

Finally, beginning in 2007, under the direction of our new
    senior executives, we undertook an extensive review of our
    operations and identified a number of planned improvements we
    subsequently announced in 2008. These include developing a new
    manufacturing facility in Ireland, upgrading our sales and
    distribution capabilities in the U.S., enhancing our information
    technology and quality systems and investing in our spine,
    dental and trauma business units.

Zimmer Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our
    history dates to 1927, when Zimmer Manufacturing Company, a
    predecessor, was founded in Warsaw, Indiana. On August 6,
    2001, Zimmer Holdings was spun off from its former parent and
    became an independent public company.

CUSTOMERS, SALES
    AND MARKETING

Our primary customers include musculoskeletal surgeons,
    neurosurgeons, oral surgeons, dentists, hospitals, distributors,
    healthcare dealers and, in their capacity as agents, healthcare
    purchasing organizations or buying groups. These customers range
    from large multinational enterprises to independent surgeons.

We have operations in more than 25 countries and market products
    in more than 100 countries, with corporate headquarters in
    Warsaw, Indiana, and more than 100 manufacturing, distribution
    and warehousing

and/or

office facilities worldwide. We manage our operations through
    three major geographic segments – the Americas, which
    is comprised principally of the United States and includes other
    North, Central and South American markets; Europe, which is
    comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and
    Africa; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan
    and includes other Asian and Pacific markets.

We market and sell products through three principal channels:
    1) direct to healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, or
    direct channel accounts, 2) through stocking distributors
    and, in the Asia Pacific region, healthcare dealers, and
    3) directly to dental practices and dental laboratories.
    With direct channel accounts, inventory is generally consigned
    to sales agents or customers. With sales to stocking
    distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices and dental
    laboratories, title to product passes generally upon shipment.
    Direct channel accounts represented approximately
    80 percent of our net sales in 2007. No individual direct
    channel account, stocking distributor, healthcare dealer, dental
    practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than
    1 percent of our net sales for 2007.

We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title
    to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products
    are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock
    levels are determined based on a number of factors, including
    demand, manufacturing lead times and

quantities required to maintain service levels. We also carry
    trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that
    are generally consistent with local market practices.

We utilize a network of sales associates, sales managers and
    support personnel, most of whom are employed or contracted by
    independent distributors and sales agencies. We invest a
    significant amount of time and expense in training sales
    associates in how to use specific products and how to best
    inform surgeons of product features and uses. Sales force
    representatives must have strong technical selling skills and
    medical education to provide technical support for surgeons.

In response to the different healthcare systems throughout the
    world, our sales and marketing strategies and organizational
    structures differ by region. We utilize a global approach to
    sales force training, marketing and medical education to provide
    consistent, high quality service. Additionally, we keep current
    with key surgical developments and other issues related to
    musculoskeletal surgeons and the medical procedures they perform.

Americas.

The Americas is our largest
    geographic segment, accounting for $2,277.0 million, or
    58 percent, of 2007 net sales, with the United States
    accounting for 94 percent of net sales in this region. The
    United States sales force consists primarily of independent
    sales agents, most of whom sell products exclusively for Zimmer.
    Sales agents in the United States receive a commission on
    product sales and are responsible for many operating decisions
    and costs. Sales commissions are accrued at the time of sale.

In this region, we contract with group purchasing organizations
    and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by
    offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions
    within a specified group. At negotiated thresholds within a
    contract buying period, price discounts increase. Generally, we
    are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources
    for specified products, although members are not obligated to
    purchase our products. Contracts with group purchasing
    organizations generally have a term of three years with
    extensions as warranted.

A majority of hospitals in the United States belong to at least
    one group purchasing organization. In 2007, individual hospital
    orders purchased through contractual arrangements with our three
    largest group purchasing organizations accounted for
    approximately 48 percent of our net sales in the United
    States. Contractual sales were highest through Novation, LLC,
    Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P., and Health
    Trust Purchasing Group, representing 27 percent,
    15 percent and 6 percent, respectively, of net sales
    in the United States. No individual end-user, however, accounted
    for over 1 percent of our net sales, and the top ten
    end-users accounted for approximately 4 percent of our
    aggregate net sales in the United States.

In the Americas, we monitor and rank independent sales agents
    across a range of performance metrics. We evaluate independent
    sales agents based on achieving certain sales targets and on
    maintaining efficient levels of working capital. We set
    expectations for efficient management of inventory and provide
    independent sales agents an incentive to aid in the collection
    of receivables.

Europe.

The European geographic segment
    accounted for $1,081.0 million, or 28 percent, of
    2007 net sales, with France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
    Switzerland and the United Kingdom collectively accounting for
    over 75 percent of net sales in the region. This segment
    also includes other key markets, including Benelux, Nordic,
    Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our
    sales force in this region is comprised of independent
    distributors, commissioned agents, direct sales associates and
    sales support personnel. In Europe, we emphasize the advantages
    of our clinically proven, established designs and innovative
    solutions, such as minimally invasive surgical procedures and
    technologies and new and enhanced materials and surfaces.

Asia Pacific.

The Asia Pacific geographic
    segment accounted for $539.5 million, or 14 percent,
    of 2007 net sales, with Japan being the largest market
    within this segment, accounting for approximately
    54 percent of the region’s sales. This segment also
    includes key markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Korea,
    China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and
    Malaysia. In Japan and most countries in the Asia Pacific
    region, we maintain a network of dealers, who act as order
    agents on behalf of hospitals in the region, and sales
    associates, who build and maintain relationships with
    musculoskeletal surgeons in their markets. These sales
    associates cover over 7,000 hospitals in the region. The
    knowledge and skills of our sales associates play a critical
    role in providing service, product information and support to
    surgeons.

SEASONALITY

Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, as many of our
    products are used in elective procedures, which typically
    decline during the summer months and holiday seasons.

DISTRIBUTION

We operate distribution facilities domestically in Warsaw,
    Indiana; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina; Memphis,
    Tennessee; Carlsbad, California; and internationally, in
    Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
    Korea, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and the
    United Kingdom. We generally ship our orders via expedited
    courier. Our operations support local language labeling for
    shipments to the European Union member countries. Our backlog of
    firm orders is not considered material to an understanding of
    our business.

PRODUCTS

Our products include joint and dental reconstructive orthopaedic
    implants, spinal implants, trauma products, and related
    orthopaedic surgical products. Reconstructive orthopaedic
    implants restore joint function lost due to disease or trauma in
    joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental
    reconstructive implants restore function and aesthetics in
    patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or disease.
    Orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons use spinal implants in
    the treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and

trauma. Trauma products are used primarily to reattach or
    stabilize damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s
    natural healing process. Our related orthopaedic surgical
    products include supplies and instruments designed to aid in
    orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation
    rehabilitation.

Orthopaedic
    Reconstructive Implants

Minimally
    Invasive Solutions Procedures and Technologies and The Zimmer
    Institute

In 2007, we continued to expand our efforts to apply minimally
    invasive surgical techniques to orthopaedic surgery, which we
    refer to as

Minimally Invasive
    Solutions

tm

(MIS) Procedures and Technologies. The principal goals of these
    MIS Technology efforts are to reduce the hardships of having a
    total joint replacement, such as the time a patient must spend
    in recovery, pain reduction and lost time from work. We have
    used The Zimmer Institute to facilitate the training of over
    7,900 surgeons on several MIS Procedures. In 2007, we trained
    nearly 1,700 surgeons through The Zimmer Institute. We intend to
    continue to conduct validated objective-based medical education
    that is designed to ensure surgical skill development in the
    safe and effective use of Zimmer products and procedures.

We continue to work with surgeons to evaluate and refine our MIS
    procedures. As refinements occur, they are incorporated into our
    course curriculum. We are focused on commercializing existing
    MIS Technique approaches and investigating new ways to apply MIS
    Technology principles to additional procedures and products.

Knee
    Implants

Total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral
    component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an articular
    surface (placed on the tibial tray). Knee replacement surgeries
    include first-time, or primary, joint replacement procedures and
    revision procedures for the replacement, repair or enhancement
    of an implant or component from a previous procedure. Knee
    implants are designed to accommodate different levels of
    ligament stabilization of the joint. While some knee implant
    designs, called cruciate retaining (CR) designs, require the
    retention of the posterior cruciate ligament, other designs,
    called posterior stabilized (PS) and ultracongruent (UC)
    designs, provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate
    ligament. There are also procedures for partial reconstruction
    of the knee, which treat limited knee degeneration and involve
    the replacement of only one side, or compartment, of the knee
    with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis.

Our portfolio of MIS Techniques includes the MIS Mini-Incision
    Total Knee Procedure. The MIS Mini-Incision Total Knee
    Instruments feature smaller instruments which accommodate a
    smaller incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft
    tissues.

We offer a wide range of products for specialized knee
    procedures, including the following:

NexGen

    system offers the surgeon the ability to conserve bone by
    replacing only the compartment of the knee that has had
    degenerative changes.

Hip
    Implants

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the
    femur and the socket portion of the pelvis (acetabulum) of the
    natural hip. Hip procedures include first time, or primary,
    joint replacement as well as revision procedures. Approximately
    30 percent of hip implant procedures involve the use of
    bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the
    surrounding bone. The remaining are press-fit into bone, which
    means that they have a surface that bone affixes to through
    either ongrowth or ingrowth technologies.

Our portfolio of MIS Techniques includes the

Zimmer

MIS

.

CopiOs

Bone Void Filler is a collagen-based synthetic bone graft
    material formed into pads of various sizes for surgical
    implantation. It is intended for filling bone voids resulting
    from trauma or created by a surgeon.

Trauma

Trauma products include devices used to stabilize damaged or
    broken bones and their surrounding tissues to support the
    body’s natural healing processes. Fractures are most often
    stabilized using internal fixation devices such as plates,
    screws, nails, wires and pins, but may also be stabilized using
    external fixation devices which are applied externally to the
    limb. We are focused on addressing unmet clinical needs,
    aligning our trauma products with MIS Procedures and on
    integrating orthobiologics and other next-generation
    technologies into our portfolio of trauma solutions.

In 2007, the new standalone Zimmer Trauma division was moved to
    a new office and manufacturing facility in Warsaw, Indiana.
    Zimmer Trauma offers a comprehensive line of trauma products,
    including:

M/DN

®

Intramedullary Fixation,

Sirus

®

Intramedullary Nail System, and

I.T.S.T.

tm

Intertrochanteric/Subtrochanteric Fixation
    System.  The

M/DN, Sirus and I.T.S.T.

Intramedullary Nailing Systems are utilized for the internal
    fixation of long bone fractures. The systems include specialized
    instrumentation that allow the nails to be put in using a
    minimally invasive approach. The

I.T.S.T.

nail system
    helps surgeons treat patients with fractures of the hip and
    proximal femur. Instrumentation for the

I.T.S.T.

system
    enables the use of the nail through an MIS approach.

Sirus

nails are highly anatomic, designed to match patients of
    every size. The nails and associated implants are made from a
    titanium alloy, a material which is preferred by many surgeons.
    The

Sirus

nails, originally sold only in Europe and parts
    of Asia Pacific, have recently been introduced into the United
    States, Japan and other key markets.

NCB

®

Plating System.  The titanium

    femur, proximal humerus and proximal tibia.

Zimmer

®

Periarticular Locking Plates.  The

Zimmer

Periarticular Locking Plate System combines advanced design
    techniques with locking screw technology to create constructs
    for use in comminuted fractures or where deficient bone stock or
    poor bone quality is encountered. By combining locking screw
    holes with compression slots, the plates can be used as both
    locking devices and fracture compression devices. The latest
    addition to this line is the Distal Lateral Fibular Locking
    plate.

Zimmer

®

Universal Locking System.  The

Zimmer

Universal
    Locking System is a comprehensive system of mini and small
    fragment stainless steel plates, screws and instruments for
    fracture fixation. The Universal Locking System plates resemble
    standard plates, but have figure-8 shaped holes that will
    accommodate standard or locking screws on either side of the
    hole. As a result, the plate can be used, depending upon the
    fracture situation, as a compression plate, a locked internal
    fixator or as an internal fixation system combining both
    techniques.

Orthopaedic
    Surgical Products

ORTHOBIOLOGICS

Our research and development efforts include an Orthobiologics
    group based in Austin, Texas, with its own full-time staff and
    dedicated projects centralizing our efforts on the development
    of technologies for orthopaedic applications, including the
    repair and replacement of damaged tendon, ligament, meniscus,
    cartilage, bone and spinal nucleus tissues. This group works on
    biological solutions to repair and regenerate damaged or
    degenerated musculoskeletal tissues using biomaterials which
    offer the possibility of treating damaged joints by biological
    repair rather than replacing them with inert materials. A
    sampling of some of our key projects in the Orthobiologics area
    is set forth below.

We are collaborating with ISTO Technologies, Inc. (ISTO) to
    develop chondral and osteochondral grafts for cartilage repair.
    ISTO is developing cell-based therapies for cartilage
    regeneration using cells from juvenile donor cartilage, with
    initial applications focused upon knee joints. Neocartilage is a
    living tissue-engineered cartilage graft under investigation for
    the restoration of cartilage defects, reestablishment of joint
    function and relief of pain in the knee. The Phase I clinical
    trial (IND) for Neocartilage has completed patient enrollment
    with some patients having reached the

12-month

follow-up

milestone. We plan to distribute this product as

DeNovo

®

ET Engineered Tissue Graft. In addition, we launched the first
    Zimmer cartilage repair product
    (

DeNovo

®

NT Natural Tissue Graft) in 2007. This product provides juvenile
    cartilage tissue pieces for repair of cartilage defects in a
    variety of anatomical sites including knee, hip, shoulder and
    ankle.

Many orthopaedic surgical procedures use bone grafts to help
    regenerate lost or damaged bone. As noted above, our Spine and
    Trauma divisions introduced a technologically-advanced synthetic
    bone graft material,

CopiOs

Bone Void Filler, in a paste
    formulation. This synthetic material has similarities to human
    cancellous bone and is used to fill bone voids or defects. It
    can be soaked in an individual’s own bone marrow to
    localize biologic components necessary for bone growth to aid in
    healing. It is then placed into the bone void where it is
    completely replaced by natural bone during the healing process.

RESEARCH AND
    DEVELOPMENT

We have extensive research and development activities to develop
    new surgical techniques, materials, orthobiologics and product
    designs. The research and development functions work closely
    with our strategic brand marketing function. The rapid
    commercialization of innovative new materials, orthobiologics
    products, implant and instrument designs, and surgical
    techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to
    be an important driver of sales growth.

    $175.5 million, respectively, on research and development.
    The increased research and development expenditures have
    accelerated the output of new orthopaedic and dental
    reconstructive implants, spine and trauma products, including
    advanced new materials, product designs and surgical techniques.
    Our primary research and development facility is located in
    Warsaw, Indiana. In 2007, we completed our research and
    development facility expansion project in Warsaw. We have other
    research and development personnel based in, among other places,
    Winterthur, Switzerland; Austin, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
    Carlsbad, California; Dover, Ohio; and Parsippany, New Jersey.
    As of December 31, 2007, we employed more than 700 research
    and development employees worldwide.

    REGULATION OF OUR OPERATIONS

We are subject to government regulation in the countries in
    which we conduct business. In the United States, numerous laws
    and regulations govern all the processes by which medical
    devices are brought to market. These include, among

    HOLDINGS,
    INC.                                                                                                                                                              2007

ANNUAL REPORT

others, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations
    issued or promulgated thereunder. The U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) has enacted regulations that control all
    aspects of the development, manufacture, advertising, promotion
    and postmarket surveillance of medical products, including
    medical devices. In addition, the FDA controls the access of
    products to market through processes designed to ensure that
    only products that are safe and effective are made available to
    the public.

Most of our new products fall into FDA classifications that
    require the submission of a Premarket Notification (510(k)) to
    the FDA. This process requires us to demonstrate that the device
    to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is,
    substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device. We must
    submit information that supports our substantial equivalency
    claims. Before we can market the new device, we must receive an
    order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence and clearing
    the new device for commercial distribution in the United States.
    Other devices we develop and market are in a category (class)
    for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical
    investigation and Premarket Approval (PMA) requirements. The PMA
    process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that
    establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective.
    The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution
    if it determines that the data and information in the PMA
    constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is
    reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for
    its intended use(s). All of our devices marketed in the United
    States have been cleared or approved by the FDA, with the
    exception of certain

pre-amendment

devices which were in commercial distribution prior to
    May 28, 1976. The FDA has grandfathered these devices, so
    new FDA submissions are not required. Some low risk medical
    devices (including most instruments) also do not require FDA
    review and approval or clearance prior to commercial
    distribution. The FDA has the authority to: halt the
    distribution of certain medical devices; detain or seize
    adulterated or misbranded medical devices; or order the repair,
    replacement of or refund the costs of such devices. There are
    also certain requirements of state, local and foreign
    governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and
    marketing of our products.

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our
    products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among
    other things, design and product standards, packaging
    requirements and labeling requirements. Many of the regulations
    applicable to our devices and products in these countries are
    similar to those of the FDA. The member countries of the
    European Union have adopted the European Medical Device
    Directive, which creates a single set of medical device
    regulations for products marketed in all member countries.
    Compliance with the Medical Device Directive and certification
    to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a CE mark
    on its products. To obtain authorization to affix the CE mark to
    a product, a recognized European Notified Body must assess a
    manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s
    conformity to the requirements of the Medical Device Directive.
    We are subject to inspection by the Notified Bodies for
    compliance with these requirements.

Further, we are subject to various federal and state laws
    concerning healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims
    laws and anti-kickback laws. These laws are administered by,
    among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of
    Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
    and state attorneys general. Many of these agencies have
    increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical
    device manufacturers in recent years. In 2007, we and other
    major U.S. orthopaedic manufacturers settled alleged
    violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute with the
    U.S. Department of Justice. As part of this settlement, we
    entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement and a Corporate
    Integrity Agreement and paid a civil settlement amount. See
    “Item 1A — Risk Factors — RISKS
    RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS” for more information about our
    obligations under these agreements. We are continuing to enhance
    our Corporate Compliance Program and are applying these
    enhancements to all of our businesses on a global basis. We are
    monitoring our practices on an ongoing basis to better ensure
    that we have proper controls in place to comply with the laws
    referenced above. Violations of these laws are punishable by
    criminal

and/or

civil
    sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment
    and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in
    government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and
    Veterans Administration (VA) health programs.

Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex
    federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and
    occupational safety laws and regulations, including those
    relating to discharges of substances in the air, water and land,
    the handling, storage and disposal of wastes and the cleanup of
    properties by pollutants. We do not expect that the ongoing
    costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will
    have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital
    expenditures or competitive position.

COMPETITION

The orthopaedics industry is highly competitive. In the global
    markets for reconstructive implants, trauma and orthopaedic
    surgical products, our major competitors include: DePuy
    Orthopaedics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson &
    Johnson), Stryker Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Synthes, Inc.,
    Smith & Nephew plc, Wright Medical Group, Inc. and
    Tornier Inc.

In the Americas geographic segment, we and DePuy Orthopaedics,
    Inc., Stryker Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Smith &
    Nephew, Inc. (a subsidiary of Smith & Nephew plc),
    Wright Medical Group, Inc. and Synthes, Inc., account for a
    large majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant
    sales.

In the Asia Pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma
    products, we compete primarily with DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.,
    Stryker Corporation, Synthes, Inc. and Smith & Nephew
    plc, as well as regional companies, including Japan Medical
    Materials Corporation and Japan Medical Dynamic Marketing, Inc.
    Factors, such as the dealer system,

ANNUAL REPORT

complex regulatory environments and the accompanying inability
    to compete on price, make it difficult for smaller companies,
    particularly those that are non-regional, to compete effectively
    with the market leaders in the Asia Pacific region.

The European reconstructive implant and trauma product markets
    are more fragmented than the Americas or the Asia Pacific
    segments. The variety of philosophies held by European surgeons
    regarding hip reconstruction, for example, has fostered the
    existence of many regional European companies, including Mathys
    AG and Waldemar LINK GmbH & Co. KG, which compete with
    us in addition to the global competitors. Today most hip
    implants sold in Europe are products developed specifically for
    Europe, although global products are gaining acceptance.
    Therefore, we will continue to develop and produce specially
    tailored products to meet specific European needs.

In the spinal implant category, we compete globally primarily
    with Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic,
    Inc.), DePuy Spine (a subsidiary of Johnson &
    Johnson), Synthes, Inc., Stryker Corporation and EBI, L.P., now
    operating as Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine (a subsidiary of
    Biomet, Inc.).

In the dental reconstructive implant category, we compete
    primarily with Nobel Biocare Holding AG, Straumann Holding AG,
    and Implant Innovations, Inc. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.).

Competition within the industry is primarily based on
    technology, innovation, quality, reputation and customer
    service. A key factor in our continuing success in the future
    will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing
    products and technologies. Where possible, we will continue to
    seek patent, trademark and other intellectual property
    protection concerning the surgical techniques, materials,
    technologies and products we design and develop.

MANUFACTURING AND
    RAW MATERIALS

We manufacture substantially all of our products at eight
    locations including Warsaw, Indiana; Winterthur, Switzerland;
    Ponce, Puerto Rico; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina;
    Carlsbad, California; Parsippany, New Jersey; and Etupes,
    France. In February 2008, we announced plans to open a new
    manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland.

We believe that our manufacturing facilities set industry
    standards in terms of automation and productivity and have the
    flexibility to accommodate future growth. The manufacturing
    operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the
    cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a
    manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous operational
    improvement. In addition, at certain of our manufacturing
    facilities, many of the employees are cross-trained.

We generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at
    levels up to 90 percent of total capacity. We continually
    evaluate the potential to in-source products currently purchased
    from outside vendors to

on-site

production.

Improving manufacturing process capability and productivity have
    been major contributors to improvement in profitability and
    offset the impact of inflationary costs. Major areas of
    improvement have included utilization of computer-assisted
    robots and multi-axis grinders to precision polish medical
    devices, automation of certain manufacturing and inspection
    processes including on-machine inspection and process controls,
    state-of-the-art equipment purchases and upgrades, in-sourcing
    of core products, such as castings and forgings, high-speed
    machining, and negotiated reductions in third party supplier
    costs.

We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the
    manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw
    materials and select components used in manufacturing our
    products from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase some
    supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance,
    sole source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints
    resulting from regulatory requirements. We work closely with our
    suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high
    quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any
    significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials
    necessary to fulfill our production schedules.

INTELLECTUAL
    PROPERTY

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the
    continued success of our business. We also rely upon trade
    secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and
    licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive
    position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of
    methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary
    information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and
    others who may have access to proprietary information. We own or
    control through licensing arrangements more than 4,000 issued
    patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate
    to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our
    products.

EMPLOYEES

We employ more than 7,600 employees worldwide, including
    more than 700 employees dedicated to research and
    development. Nearly 4,700 employees are located within the
    United States and approximately 2,900 employees are located
    outside of the United States, primarily throughout Europe and in
    Japan. We have over 3,300 employees dedicated to
    manufacturing our products worldwide. The Warsaw, Indiana
    production facility employs more than 1,500 employees.
    Fewer than 200 North American employees are members of a trade
    union covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

In May 2007, we renewed a collective bargaining agreement with
    the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber Manufacturing,
    Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International
    Union for and on behalf of Local

2737-15

covering employees at the Dover, Ohio, facility which continues
    in effect until May 15, 2012.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

Risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from
    our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial
    condition and results of operations are discussed below and
    elsewhere in this report. The risks and uncertainties described
    below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and
    uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently
    not believed to be significant to our business may also affect
    our actual results and could harm our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. If any of the risks or
    uncertainties described below or any additional risks and
    uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of
    operations and financial condition could be materially and
    adversely affected.

RISKS RELATED TO
    OUR BUSINESS

If we fail to comply with the terms of the Deferred
    Prosecution Agreement and Corporate Integrity Agreement we
    entered into in September 2007, we may be subject to criminal
    prosecution

and/or

exclusion from federal healthcare programs.

As previously reported, on September 27, 2007, we settled
    an investigation conducted by the United States Attorney’s
    Office for the District of New Jersey (the
    “U.S. Attorney”) into financial relationships
    between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting
    orthopaedic surgeons. As part of that settlement, we entered
    into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the “DPA”) with
    the U.S. Attorney and a Corporate Integrity Agreement (the
    “CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General of the
    Department of Health and Human Services (the
    “OIG-HHS”). Copies of the DPA and CIA are filed as
    exhibits to this report and a copy of the DPA is available on
    our website at www.zimmer.com.

The DPA has a term of 18 months and provides for oversight
    by a federally appointed monitor. If we breach the DPA, we could
    be subject to prosecution for violations of the federal
    Anti-Kickback Statute that the U.S. Attorney alleges we
    committed between 2002 and 2006, as well as any new or
    continuing violations. We could also be subject to exclusion by
    OIG-HHS from participation in federal healthcare programs,
    including Medicaid and Medicare. Any of these consequences would
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

The CIA requires us to continue our Corporate Compliance Program
    and to adhere to certain other provisions, including reporting
    requirements. We also agreed to retain an independent review
    organization to perform annual reviews to assist us in assessing
    our compliance with the CIA to ensure that arrangements we enter
    into do not violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. If we
    breach the CIA, the OIG-HHS may take further action against us,
    up to and including excluding us from participation in federal
    healthcare programs, which would have a material adverse effect
    on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our recent settlement with the Department of Justice and
    OIG-HHS could lead to further governmental investigations or
    actions by other third parties.

As a result of the publicity surrounding our recent settlement
    with the Department of Justice and OIG-HHS, including the
    allegations of wrongdoing made by the U.S. Attorney, other
    governmental agencies, including state authorities, could
    conduct investigations or institute proceedings that are not
    precluded by terms of that settlement. As previously disclosed,
    the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has commenced an
    informal investigation into sales by us and other companies of
    medical devices in foreign countries. We are also cooperating
    with an investigative demand made by one state attorney general.
    While we believe that the pending state investigation is not
    likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or
    financial condition, similar investigations by other states or
    governmental agencies are possible. In addition, in January
    2008, we received a written request from the United States
    Senate Special Committee on Aging (“Committee”),
    seeking, among other things, additional information regarding
    the financial relationships we publicly disclosed pursuant to
    the DPA. We responded to this request in writing and through
    testimony before the Committee in February 2008. Also, as
    previously reported, two shareholder derivative actions were
    filed purportedly on our behalf against current and two former
    directors relating to oversight of the conduct that lead to the
    settlement with the U.S. Attorney. In addition, the
    settlement with the U.S. Attorney could increase our
    exposure to lawsuits by potential whistleblowers under the
    federal false claims acts, based on new theories or allegations
    arising from the allegations made by the U.S. Attorney. We
    intend to review and take appropriate actions with respect to
    any such investigations or proceedings; however, we cannot
    assure that

the costs of defending or resolving those investigations or
    proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

If we are not able to fulfill or otherwise resolve our
    existing royalty and other payment obligations to consulting
    surgeons and institutions, our ability to maintain our existing
    intellectual property rights and obtain future rights may be
    impaired.

We are reviewing agreements we have entered into with consulting
    surgeons and institutions and assessing whether we can fulfill
    our obligations under these agreements in view of the DPA. If we
    do not perform those obligations or reach some other resolution
    acceptable to the affected consulting surgeons and institutions,
    our ability to use the intellectual property covered by those
    agreements may be adversely affected. In addition, our ability
    to enter into new agreements with consulting surgeons or
    institutions for the future development of intellectual property
    rights may be adversely affected.

Our ongoing efforts to enhance our Corporate Compliance
    Program globally will require cooperation by many employees and
    others and may divert substantial financial and human resources
    from our other business activities.

We are committed to devoting sufficient resources to meet our
    obligations under the DPA and CIA. We have also announced our
    intention to further enhance our Corporate Compliance Program
    and to expand those enhancements into all of our businesses on a
    global basis. Successful implementation of this enhanced program
    will require the full cooperation of our employees, distributors
    and sales agents and the healthcare professionals with whom they
    interact. These efforts not only involve expense, but also
    require management and other key employees to focus extensively
    on these matters, preventing them from devoting as much time as
    they otherwise would to other business matters.

In addition, if our competitors do not make similar enhancements
    to their compliance programs, this may place us at a competitive
    disadvantage and adversely affect our results of operations.

If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors
    upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may
    not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may
    decline.

Our marketing success in the United States and abroad depends
    significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales
    and service expertise in the marketplace. Many of these agents
    have developed professional relationships with existing and
    potential customers because of the agents’ detailed
    knowledge of products and instruments. A loss of a significant
    number of these agents could have a material adverse effect on
    our business and results of operations. If some of the business
    practices of our independent sales agents and distributors are
    challenged as unlawful, they may have to change these practices,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our business and
    results of operations.

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our
    products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy
    our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we
    may not anticipate because of:

•

evolving customer needs;

•

changing demographics;

•

slowing industry growth rates;

•

declines in the reconstructive implant market;

•

the introduction of new products and technologies;

•

evolving surgical philosophies; and

•

evolving industry standards.

Without the timely introduction of new products and
    enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If
    that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer.
    The success of our new product offerings will depend on several
    factors, including our ability to:

•

properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

•

commercialize new products in a timely manner;

•

manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient
    volumes on time;

•

differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings;

•

achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

•

satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers
    and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative
    recovery and lower-cost procedures;

•

innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical
    techniques; and

•

provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical
    techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some
    or all markets, because of, among other factors:

•

entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

•

the need for regulatory clearance; and

•

uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment
    in research and development before we can determine their
    commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources
    necessary to fund the production. In addition, even if we are
    able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of
    our products, these enhancements or new generations of products
    may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development
    and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer
    preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products
    embodying new technologies or features.

We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside
    of the United States, which subjects us to additional business
    risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to
    increased costs.

Because we sell our products in more than 100 countries, our
    business is subject to risks associated with doing business
    internationally. In 2007, we derived approximately
    $1,757.2 million, or 45% of our total revenue, from sales
    of our products outside of the United States. We intend to
    continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales
    internationally, which could expose us to additional risks
    associated with international sales and operations. Our
    international operations

are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and
    potential costs, including:

•

changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

•

unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;

•

differing local product preferences and product requirements;

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries
    outside of the United States;

•

trade protection measures and import or export requirements that
    may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and
    may increase our operating costs;

•

foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from
    repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United States;

•

complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

•

extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

labor force instability;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

•

political and economic instability.

Violations stemming from any of the above identified risks could
    result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or
    our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and
    damage to our reputation.

We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate
    fluctuations, which can increase our costs and may cause our
    profitability to decline.

A substantial portion of our foreign revenues are generated in
    Europe and Japan. The United States dollar value of our
    foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate
    fluctuations. Significant increases in the value of the United
    States dollar relative to the Euro or the Japanese Yen, as well
    as other currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations. We address currency risk management
    through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a
    limited basis, through the use of derivative financial
    instruments. The derivative financial instruments we enter into
    are in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major
    financial institutions. The forward contracts are designed to
    hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily
    intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods
    consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and
    losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are
    temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, and then
    recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings.

We may fail to adequately protect our proprietary technology
    and other intellectual property, which would allow competitors
    or others to take advantage of our research and development
    efforts.

Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market
    technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or
    maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not
    be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary
    technologies. Also, our currently pending or future patent
    applications may not result in issued patents. In the United
    States, patent applications are confidential for 18 months
    following their filing, and, because third parties may have
    filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending
    patent applications without our being aware of those
    applications, our patent applications may not have priority over
    patent applications of others. In addition, our issued patents
    may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against
    third parties with similar technologies or products, or provide
    us with any competitive advantage. If a third party initiates
    litigation regarding our patents, our collaborators’
    patents, or those patents for which we have license rights, and
    is successful, a court could declare our patents invalid or
    unenforceable or limit the scope of coverage of those patents.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the
    courts have not consistently treated the breadth of claims
    allowed or interpreted in orthopaedic reconstructive implant and
    biotechnology patents. If the USPTO or the courts begin to allow
    or interpret claims more broadly, the incidence and cost of
    patent interference proceedings and the risk of infringement
    litigation will likely increase. On the other hand, if the USPTO
    or the courts begin to allow or interpret claims more narrowly,
    the value of our proprietary rights may be reduced. Any changes
    in, or unexpected interpretations of, the patent laws may
    adversely affect our ability to enforce our patent position.

In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or
    limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier
    for competitors to capture market position. Competitors may also
    capture market share from us by designing products that mirror
    the capabilities of our products or technology without
    infringing our intellectual property rights. If we do not obtain
    sufficient international protection for our intellectual
    property, our competitiveness in international markets could be
    impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue.

We also rely upon trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and
    continuing technological innovation to remain competitive. We
    attempt to protect this information with security measures,
    including the use of confidentiality agreements with our
    employees, consultants, and collaborators. These individuals may
    breach these agreements and any remedies available to us may be
    insufficient to compensate our damages. Furthermore, our trade
    secrets, know-how and other technology may otherwise become
    known or be independently discovered by our competitors.

We may be subject to intellectual property litigation and
    infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant
    expenses or prevent us from selling our products.

A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property
    infringement against us could adversely affect our growth and
    profitability, in some cases materially. From time to time, we
    receive notices from third parties of potential infringement and
    receive claims of potential infringement. We may be unaware of
    intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of
    our technology. If someone claims that our products infringed
    their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation
    could be costly and time consuming and would divert the
    attention of management and key personnel from other business
    issues.

FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of
    intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Claims of
    intellectual property infringement also might require us to
    enter into costly royalty or license agreements. However, we may
    be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms
    acceptable to us or at all. We also may be subject to
    significant damages or an injunction preventing us from
    manufacturing, selling or using some of our products in the
    event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual
    property infringement. Any of these adverse consequences could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

We may complete additional acquisitions, which could increase
    our costs or liabilities or be disruptive.

We intend to continue to look for additional strategic
    acquisitions of other businesses that are complementary to our
    businesses. Acquisition involves risk, including the following:

•

we may need to divert more management resources to integration
    than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to
    pursue other more profitable activities;

•

the difficulties of integration may be increased if we need to
    integrate geographically separated organizations, personnel with
    disparate business backgrounds and companies with different
    corporate cultures;

•

we may not eliminate as many redundant costs as we anticipated
    in selecting our acquisition candidates; and

•

one or more of our acquisition candidates also may have
    liabilities or adverse operating issues that we failed to
    discover through our diligence prior to the acquisition.

If we are unable to form strategic alliances, or if our
    strategic alliances fail to achieve their objectives, our
    operating results will be negatively impacted.

We have entered into strategic alliances with other orthopaedic
    and biotechnology companies. These include our collaboration
    with ISTO Technologies, Inc. relating to regenerative cartilage
    technology and our distribution agreement with Heraeus relating
    to orthopaedic bone cement products. The success of these and
    similar arrangements is largely dependent on technology and
    other intellectual property contributed by our strategic
    partners or the resources, efforts and skills of these partners.
    Disputes and difficulties in such relationships are common,
    often due to conflicting priorities. Merger and acquisition
    activity may exacerbate these issues. The benefits of these
    alliances are reduced or eliminated when strategic partners:

•

terminate the agreements or limit our access to the underlying
    intellectual property;

•

fail to devote financial or other resources to the alliances and
    thereby hinder or delay development, manufacturing or
    commercialization activities;

•

fail to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize any
    products; or

•

fail to maintain the financial resources necessary to continue
    financing their portion of the development, manufacturing, or
    commercialization costs or their own operations.

Furthermore, under some of our strategic alliances, we may make
    milestone payments well in advance of commercialization of
    products with no assurance that we will ever recoup these
    payments. We also may make equity investments in our strategic
    partners. These investments may decline in value and result in
    our incurring financial statement charges in the future.

We depend on a limited number of suppliers for some key raw
    materials and outsourced activities.

We use a number of suppliers for raw materials that we need to
    manufacture our products and to outsource some key manufacturing
    activities. These suppliers must provide the materials and
    perform the activities to our standards for us to meet our
    quality and regulatory requirements. Some key raw materials and
    outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source
    or a limited number of sources. A prolonged disruption or other
    inability to obtain these materials or outsource key
    manufacturing activities could materially and adversely affect
    our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could have
    a material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

Our future profitability may be affected by changes to our
    product category and region sales mix.

Reconstructive implants produce the highest operating profit
    margins among our product categories. These products accounted
    for approximately 84% of 2007 net sales. Sales in our
    Americas region accounted for approximately 58% of 2007 net
    sales. Sales in the Americas region produce the highest
    operating profit margins in the geographic markets in which we
    operate. While we expect net sales of reconstructive implants
    and net sales in the Americas region to remain strong, changes
    to our product category mix or our region sales mix could
    adversely affect our future profitability.

RISKS RELATED TO
    OUR INDUSTRY

The ongoing informal investigation by the United States
    Securities and Exchange Commission regarding potential
    violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the sale of
    medical devices in a number of foreign countries by companies in
    the medical device industry could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, financial condition and cash flows.

We are cooperating fully with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission with regard to an ongoing informal investigation of
    potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the
    sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by
    companies in the medical device industry. The Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their officers,
    directors, employees, stockholders acting on their behalf and
    agents from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments
    to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
    business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment and
    this law requires companies to maintain records which fairly and
    accurately reflect transactions and to maintain internal
    accounting controls. In many countries, hospitals and clinics
    are government-owned and healthcare professionals employed by
    such hospitals and clinics, with whom we regularly interact,
    meet the definition of a foreign official for purposes of the
    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we have adopted policies
    and procedures designed to prevent improper payments and we
    conduct training in this area, there

can be no assurance that violations of these requirements do not
    occur in connection with sales of our medical devices. If we are
    found to have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, we may
    face sanctions including fines, criminal penalties, disgorgement
    of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to
    contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and cash flows.

We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations on
    an ongoing basis that could require us to change our business
    practices and restrict our operations in the future.

Our industry is subject to various federal and state laws
    pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims
    laws, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, similar state laws and
    physician self-referral laws. We settled alleged violations of
    the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in September 2007, but we
    remain subject to these laws on an ongoing basis. Violations of
    these laws are punishable by criminal

and/or

civil
    sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment
    and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in
    government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and
    Veterans Administration (VA) health programs. The interpretation
    and enforcement of these laws and regulations are uncertain and
    subject to rapid change. We are continuing to enhance our
    Corporate Compliance Program and monitoring our practices on an
    ongoing basis to better ensure that we have proper controls in
    place to comply with these laws.

If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for
    our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our
    products may decline and our ability to sell our products
    profitably may be harmed.

We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors,
    dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which receive
    reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their
    patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and
    international government programs, private insurance plans and
    managed care programs. These third-party payors may deny
    reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a
    procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment
    methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for
    an unapproved indication. Third-party payors may also decline to
    reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. If our
    products are not considered cost-effective by third-party
    payors, our customers may not be reimbursed for our products.

In addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to
    contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level
    of reimbursement for medical products and services. For example,
    managed care programs often prescribe only those orthopaedic
    recovery products that match a patient as to age, need for
    mobility and other parameters in an effort to provide more
    cost-effective care. If third-party payors reduce reimbursement
    levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our
    products, demand for our products may decline or we may
    experience pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which
    could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of
    operations.

In international markets, where the movement toward healthcare
    reform and the development of managed care are generally not as
    advanced as in the United States, we have experienced downward
    pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare
    reform. In Japan, for example, a government-operated insurance
    system reimburses customers for our products. Under this system,
    the Japanese government periodically reviews and reduces the
    reimbursement levels for products. If the Japanese government
    continues to reduce the reimbursement level for orthopaedic
    products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely
    affected.

The ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing
    organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations.

Many customers for our products have formed group purchasing
    organizations in an effort to contain costs. Group purchasing
    organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply
    manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are
    made available to a group purchasing organization’s
    affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the
    providers selected by a group purchasing organization,
    affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to
    purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization
    has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another
    manufacturer’s products, we may be precluded from making
    sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the
    duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to respond
    to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing
    organizations may cause us to lose market share to our
    competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our
    sales and results of operations.

Our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and
    market our products against those of our competitors.

We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our present or
    future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by
    technological advances by one or more of our present or future
    competitors or by other therapies, including orthobiological
    therapies. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop
    and acquire new products and technologies.

In the global markets for reconstructive orthopaedic implants,
    trauma products and other orthopaedic products, a limited number
    of competitors, including DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (a subsidiary
    of Johnson & Johnson), Stryker Corporation, Biomet,
    Inc., Wright Medical Group, Inc., Synthes, Inc. and
    Smith & Nephew plc, compete with us for the majority
    of product sales. In the spinal implant category, we compete
    globally primarily with Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a
    subsidiary of Medtronic, Inc.), DePuy Spine (a subsidiary of
    Johnson & Johnson), Synthes, Inc., Stryker Corporation
    and EBI, L.P. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.). In the dental
    reconstructive implant category, we compete primarily with Nobel
    Biocare Holding AG, Straumann Holding AG, and Implant
    Innovations, Inc. (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.). Competition is
    primarily on the basis of:

•

technology;

•

innovation;

•

quality;

•

reputation; and

•

customer service.

In markets outside of the United States, other factors influence
    competition as well, including:

•

local distribution systems;

•

complex regulatory environments; and

•

differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

Our competitors may:

•

have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

•

respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

•

undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

•

adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

•

be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees
    and strategic partners.

Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to
    have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.

We and our customers are subject to various governmental
    regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and
    marketing of our products and we may incur significant expenses
    to comply with these regulations and develop products compatible
    with these regulations.

The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market
    are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other
    federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process
    of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device,
    particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental
    authorities, can be costly and time consuming and approvals
    might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if
    at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals
    for future products could result in delayed realization of
    product revenues or in substantial additional costs which could
    have a material adverse effect on our business or results of
    operations.

In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA medical
    device or other material regulatory requirements, including, for
    example, the Quality System Regulation, recordkeeping
    regulations, labeling requirements and adverse event reporting
    regulations, that failure could result in, among other things:

•

warning letters;

•

fines or civil penalties;

•

injunctions;

•

repairs, replacements or refunds;

•

recalls or seizures of products;

•

total or partial suspension of production;

•

the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or
    approvals;

•

withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications; and

•

criminal prosecution.

Any of these actions, in combination or alone, could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our
    products, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other
    things:

•

clinical efficacy;

•

product standards;

•

packaging requirements;

•

labeling requirements;

•

import/export restrictions;

•

tariff regulations;

•

duties; and

•

tax requirements.

Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products
    in these countries, such as the European Medical Devices
    Directive, are similar to those of the FDA. In addition, in many
    countries the national health or social security organizations
    require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed
    with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility. Failure to
    receive, or delays in the receipt of, relevant foreign
    qualifications also could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

As both the FDA and foreign government regulators have become
    increasingly stringent, we may be subject to more rigorous
    regulation by governmental authorities in the future. Our
    products and operations are also often subject to the rules of
    industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards
    Organization. If we fail to adequately address any of these
    regulations, our business will be harmed.

We may incur product liability losses, and insurance coverage
    may be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.

Our business is subject to potential product liability risks
    that are inherent in the design, development, manufacture and
    marketing of medical devices. Our products are often used in
    surgical and intensive care settings. In addition, some of the
    medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be
    implanted in the human body for long periods of time. In the
    ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product
    liability lawsuits alleging that component failures,
    manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of
    product-related risks or product-related information resulted in
    an unsafe condition or injury to patients. Product liability
    lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls,
    regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material
    adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability
    to attract and retain customers.

As part of our risk management policy, we maintain third-party
    product liability insurance coverage. However, product liability
    claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our
    insurance policies or cause us to record a self-insured loss.
    Even if any product liability loss is covered by an insurance
    policy, these policies may have substantial retentions or
    deductibles that provide that we will not receive insurance
    proceeds until the losses incurred exceed the amount of those
    retentions or deductibles. We will be responsible for paying any
    losses that are below those retentions or deductibles. A product
    liability claim in excess of applicable insurance could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

In February 2008 we announced plans to expand our global
    manufacturing network by adding 100,000 square feet of
    manufacturing capacity at a new facility in Shannon, Ireland. We
    expect to begin manufacturing operations at this facility in
    late 2008. We believe the current facilities, including
    manufacturing, warehousing, research and development and office
    space, together with the planned expansion provide sufficient
    capacity to meet ongoing demands. Once a facility reaches
    85 percent utilization, we examine alternatives for either
    expanding that facility or acquiring new facilities to meet our
    ongoing demands.

In addition to the above, we maintain more than 100 other
    offices and warehouse facilities in more than 25 countries
    around the world, including the United States, Japan, Australia,
    France, Russia, India, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and China. We
    believe that all of the facilities and equipment are in good
    condition, well maintained and able to operate at present levels.

Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in
    conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the
    corresponding notes included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW

We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture
    and marketing of reconstructive orthopaedic implants, including
    joint and dental, spinal implants, trauma products and related
    orthopaedic surgical products (sometimes referred to in this
    report as “OSP”). We also provide other healthcare
    related services. Reconstructive orthopaedic implants restore
    joint function lost due to disease or trauma in joints such as
    knees, hips, shoulders and elbows. Dental reconstructive
    implants restore function and aesthetics in patients that have
    lost teeth due to trauma or disease. Spinal implants are
    utilized by orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in the
    treatment of degenerative diseases, deformities and trauma in
    all regions of the spine. Trauma products are devices used
    primarily to reattach or stabilize damaged bone and tissue to
    support the body’s natural healing process. OSP include
    supplies and instruments designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical
    procedures and post-operation rehabilitation. We have operations
    in more than 25 countries and market products in more than 100
    countries. We manage operations through three reportable
    geographic segments — the Americas, Europe and Asia
    Pacific.

Certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis
    are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and
    therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for
    disclosure purposes. Certain amounts in the 2006 consolidated
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
    2007 presentation.

We believe the following developments or trends are important in
    understanding our financial condition, results of operations and
    cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Demand (Volume
    and Mix) Trends

Increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales
    contributed 9 percentage points of 2007 sales growth, which
    is 2 percentage points above the rate of growth from 2006
    compared to 2005. We believe orthopaedic procedure volume on a
    global basis will continue to rise at mid single digit rates
    driven by an aging global population, obesity and more active
    lifestyles, among other factors. In addition, the continued
    shift in demand to premium products, such as

Longevity

,

Durasul

and

Prolong

Highly Crosslinked
    Polyethylenes,

Trabecular Metal

Technology products,
    high-flex knees, knee revision products and porous hip stems,
    continue to positively affect sales growth. For example, during
    2007, sales of products incorporating

Trabecular Metal

Technology were over $210 million, a

year-over-year

increase of over 26 percent.

We believe innovative surgical approaches will continue to
    significantly affect the orthopaedics industry. In 2007, we
    acquired ORTHOsoft Inc., a market leader in surgical navigation
    in orthopaedics. Combined with our SmartTools strategic
    initiative, we are focused on becoming a leader in operating
    room efficiency and enhancing surgical outcomes through the use
    of innovative navigation devices and cutting tools. We continued
    our significant progress in the development and introduction of
    MIS Implants, Procedures and Technologies. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, The Zimmer Institute trained nearly
    1,700 surgeons on advanced techniques, including approximately
    850 surgeons on MIS Procedures.

We believe innovative products will continue to affect the
    orthopaedics industry. In the second half of 2006, we launched
    the

Zimmer Gender Solutions

High-Flex Knee Femoral
    Implant. High Flex Knees now make up approximately
    44 percent of our total femoral unit sales on a global
    basis, having grown from approximately 28 percent prior to
    the launch of the

Zimmer Gender Solutions

Knee.

Pricing Trends

Selling prices were flat during 2007 compared to a modest
    increase during 2006 when compared to 2005. Asia Pacific selling
    prices decreased 1 percentage point for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to a 2 percent decrease in
    2006 when compared to 2005. As anticipated, the Japanese
    government reduced reimbursement rates during 2007. This action
    affected sales in Japan negatively by approximately
    5 percent for 2007, while other Asia Pacific markets were
    flat to positive. Japan represents approximately 7 percent
    of our sales. The Americas experienced a 1 percent increase
    in selling prices during 2007, compared to a 2 percent
    increase in 2006. In Europe, selling prices for 2007 decreased
    1 percent, the same decrease we saw in 2006 as compared to
    2005. Within Europe, Germany and Italy reported decreases in
    average selling prices of 4 percent and 2 percent,
    respectively, in 2007, as a result of reductions in government
    implant reimbursement rates and group purchasing arrangements
    while most other European markets were positive to flat. Germany
    and Italy combined represent approximately 11 percent of
    our sales. With the effect of governmental healthcare cost
    containment efforts and pressure from group purchasing
    organizations, global selling prices are expected to remain flat
    in 2008.

Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rates

For 2007, foreign currency exchange rates had a positive
    3 percent effect on global sales growth. If foreign
    currency exchange rates remain consistent with the year end
    rates, we estimate that the weaker dollar versus foreign
    currency exchange rates will have a positive effect in 2008 of
    approximately 2 percent on sales. We address currency risk
    through regular operating and financing activities, and under
    appropriate circumstances and subject to proper authorization,
    through the use of forward contracts solely for managing foreign
    currency volatility and risk. Changes to foreign currency
    exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting
    gains/losses on hedge contracts, which are

FORM 10-K

recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in
    the near term is expected to be minimal.

New Product
    Sales

New products, which we define as products or stock keeping units
    (“SKU’s”) introduced within the prior

36-month

period to a particular market, accounted for 25 percent, or
    $961 million, of 2007 sales. Adoption rates for new
    technologies are a key indicator of performance in our industry.
    Our sales have grown with the introduction of new products, such
    as

Trabecular Metal

Modular Acetabular Cups, certain
    SKU’s of the

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution including
    the

Gender Solutions

Knee Femoral Implant for the
    LPS-Flex and CR-Flex Knees, the

Dynesys


Dynamic Stabilization System, the

We believe new products in our current pipeline should continue
    to favorably affect our operating performance. Products we
    expect to contribute to new product sales in 2008 include the

Gender Solutions

Knee Femoral Implant;

Acquisitions

In April 2007, we acquired Endius Incorporated, a privately held
    spinal products company for an aggregate value of approximately
    $80 million in cash, before adjustments for debt repayment
    and other items.

In November 2007, we acquired ORTHOsoft Inc., a leader in
    computer navigation for orthopaedic surgery, in a cash
    transaction for an aggregate value of approximately
    $50 million.

Settlement of
    Department of Justice Investigation

On September 27, 2007, we and other major
    U.S. Orthopaedic manufacturers reached a settlement with
    the United States government to resolve all claims related to an
    ongoing investigation into financial relationships between the
    industry and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. As part of the
    settlement, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
    with the United States Attorney’s Office for the District
    of New Jersey. Under the provisions of the Deferred Prosecution
    Agreement, we are subject to oversight by a federal monitor
    selected by the U.S. Attorney for a period of
    18 months. We expect to continue to incur costs of
    approximately $6-9 million per quarter, to comply with the
    Deferred Prosecution Agreement through the remainder of the
    18 month period.

We settled civil and administrative claims related to the
    federal investigation for a cash payment to the United States
    government of $169.5 million. We recorded a
    $169.5 million expense during the third quarter in
    connection with the settlement.

We also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the
    Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of
    Health and Human Services, which has a term of 5 years. For
    more information regarding the settlement, see Note 15 to
    the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

New Accounting
    Pronouncements

On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48, which addresses
    the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to
    be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
    statements. Under FIN 48, the tax benefits from an
    uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more
    likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon
    examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
    merits of the position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income
    taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
    disclosures.

Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, we had a long term tax
    liability for expected settlement of various federal, state and
    foreign income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the
    corollary tax impacts of these expected settlements of
    $102.1 million, as well as a separate accrued interest
    liability of $1.7 million. As a result of the adoption of
    FIN 48, we are required to present the different components
    of such liability gross versus the historical net presentation.
    The adoption resulted in the tax liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits decreasing by $6.4 million as of January 1,
    2007.

This decrease in the tax liability resulted in a reduction to
    retained earnings of $4.8 million, a reduction in goodwill
    of $61.4 million, the establishment of a tax receivable of
    $58.2 million, and the addition of an interest/penalty
    payable of $7.9 million, all as of January 1, 2007.

    Outlook

Our operating profit for 2008 will be affected by the costs we
    will incur to implement a number of recently announced
    initiatives that we believe will position us to respond better
    to the changing needs of the healthcare market. Additionally,
    during 2008 we expect to incur costs of approximately
    $6-9 million per quarter to comply with the Deferred
    Prosecution

Agreement. The infrastructure and operating initiatives we plan
    to implement in 2008 include:

•

Continuing to enhance our Corporate Compliance Program and to
    apply these enhancements to all business segments;

•

Opening a new manufacturing facility in Ireland that will add an
    additional 100,000 square feet of international
    manufacturing capacity;

•

Improving our quality system infrastructure;

•

Investing in our global information technology systems,
    including improving our field-based U.S. inventory and
    instrument tracking systems;

•

Increasing instrument deployments to permit our sales and
    distribution networks to respond more rapidly to changes in
    surgical demand patterns and capitalize on new business
    opportunities; and

•

Investing in our sales force, instrumentation and
    selling-related activities in our spine, dental and trauma
    business segments.

We estimate that these initiatives will add up to approximately
    $100 million in operating expenses in 2008, including the
    monitoring fees and expenses.

    including the

NexGen

Changes in foreign exchange rates positively affected knee sales
    by 5 percent and positively affected hip sales by
    2 percent. Reported decreases in average selling prices
    negatively affected hip sales by 3 percent. The

NexGen

Complete Knee Solution product line, including

NexGen
    Trabecular Metal

Tibial Components, the

NexGen

CR-Flex Knee and the

NexGen

LPS-Flex Knee led knee
    sales. Launch of the

Gender Solutions

Knee Femoral
    Implant in Australia also contributed to strong knee sales for
    the year. The continued conversion to porous stems, including
    the Fiber Metal Taper Stem from the

VerSys

Hip System,
    the

Alloclassic Zweymüller

Hip System and the

CLS
    Spotorno

Stem led hip stem sales. Sales of

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners and

Trabecular
    Metal

Acetabular Cups also exhibited growth.

Extremities sales increased due to stronger sales of our
    shoulder and elbow products. The

Tapered Screw-Vent

Implant System led dental sales. Trauma sales were led by
    strong growth in

Zimmer

Periarticular Plates and

Zimmer

Plates and Screws, but were partially offset by a
    reported 5 percent decrease in average selling prices
    during 2007. A registration issue with the

ST360

®

Spinal Fixation System in Japan resulted in a decrease in
    sales of this device, contributing to the negative growth in
    Spine sales for 2007. Powered surgical instruments led OSP sales.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 77.5 percent
    in 2007, compared to 77.7 percent in 2006. The following
    table reconciles the gross margin for 2006 to 2007:

Year ended December 31, 2007 gross margin

The unfavorable effect of year over year changes in foreign
    currency hedge gains and losses were partially offset by lower
    unit manufacturing costs due to productivity gains as well as
    favorable geographic sales mix. These gains were further offset
    by increased inventory charges due to the impact of our newer
    products on aging product lines.

Operating
    Expenses

Research and Development, or R&D, as a percentage of net
    sales was 5.4 percent for 2007, which is unchanged from
    2006. R&D increased to $209.6 million for 2007 from
    $188.3 million in 2006, reflecting increased spending on
    new product development across all of our product segments. In
    2007, we continued to make investments in our research and
    development facilities in Warsaw, Indiana. We continued working
    with our third party partners on genetically engineered tissues
    for regenerative therapies, including soft tissue biological
    repair and replacement. New products, which we define as those
    introduced into a market in the preceding thirty-six months,
    accounted for approximately 25 percent of net sales in 2007
    compared with 24 percent in 2006. In the fourth quarter of
    2007, we announced FDA approval of the

Zimmer NexGen

LPS-Flex Mobile Knee. Additionally, in the second half of
    2007, we launched several new products, including the

Gender
    Solutions Natural-Knee

Flex System, and the

Zimmer

M/L Taper Prosthesis with

Kinectiv

Technology. We
    continue to target our R&D spending at the high end of what
    we believe to be an industry average of 4-6 percent.

Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, as a
    percentage of net sales was 38.2 percent for 2007, compared
    to 38.8 percent in 2006. The improvement in SG&A as a
    percent of net sales from the prior year is due to sales growth
    and well controlled spending.

Settlement expense of $169.5 million for 2007 relates to
    the settlement of the federal investigation into financial
    relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and
    consulting orthopaedic surgeons. Acquisition, integration and
    other items for 2007 were $25.2 million compared to
    $6.1 million in 2006. The acquisition, integration and
    other expenses recorded during 2007 reflect in-process research
    and development write-offs related to acquisitions, costs
    related to the integration of acquired U.S. distributors,
    estimated settlements for certain pre-acquisition product
    liability claims, integration consulting fees and costs for
    integrating information technology systems. The acquisition,
    integration and other expenses recorded during 2006 included
    $27.7 million of income related to three unrelated
    matters – the sale of the former Centerpulse Austin
    land and facilities for a gain of $5.1 million and the
    favorable settlement of two pre-acquisition contingent
    liabilities.

Operating
    Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings

Operating profit for 2007 decreased 3 percent to
    $1,127.6 million, from $1,165.2 million in 2006. The
    decrease is due principally to the $169.5 million
    settlement expense. Without the settlement expense, operating
    profit would have been favorable to 2006 due to increased sales
    and controlled operating expenses.

The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and
    minority interest increased to 31.6 percent for 2007, up
    from 28.6 percent in 2006. The increase in the effective
    tax rate is primarily due to the effect of the
    $169.5 million settlement expense in 2007 for which no tax
    benefit has been

FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

recognized. Without the effect of the settlement expense, the
    effective tax rate for 2007 would have been favorable to 2006
    due to increased profitability in lower tax jurisdictions.

Net earnings decreased 7 percent to $773.2 million for
    2007, compared to $834.5 million in 2006. The decrease was
    due to the $169.5 million settlement expense and the higher
    effective tax rate that resulted from the settlement expense.
    Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased 4 percent to
    $3.28 and $3.26, respectively, from $3.43 and $3.40 in 2006 due
    to fewer outstanding shares as a result of our stock repurchase
    program.

    fell by over $25 million, accounting for the decline in OSP
    product sales.

A stronger U.S. dollar in the first half of the year
    resulted in a negative 3 percent effect on sales for Asia
    Pacific, including a 3 percent drop in knee sales and a
    negative 4 percent impact on hip sales. A reduction in
    reimbursement prices for orthopaedic implants in Japan went into
    effect April 1, 2006. Together with other price changes in
    this segment this action led to a negative 2 percent effect
    on sales, including negative 2 percent on knees and
    negative 4 percent on hips. Volume and mix growth more than
    offset the negative effects of price and currency in knees while
    netting out to result in flat sales in hips. Strong knee sales
    drove growth in Asia Pacific. The

NexGen

CR-Flex Knee and
    the

NexGen

LPS-Flex Knee led knee sales. The continued
    conversion to porous stems, including the

VerSys

Hip
    System and the

CLS Spotorno

Stem led hip sales. Sales of

Longevity

Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene Liners and

Trabecular Metal

Acetabular Cups also exhibited strong
    growth.

Dental experienced double digit percentage growth compared to
    the prior year. The

Tapered Screw-Vent

Implant System and
    the

Spline

®

Implant System led dental sales. Extremity sales were impacted
    by lower sales of the

Bigliani/Flatow

Shoulder Solution.
    Strong powered instrument sales contributed to the OSP sales
    performance.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 77.7 percent
    in 2006, compared to 77.5 percent in 2005. The following

Higher average selling prices in our largest operating segment
    offset by lower prices in Europe and Asia Pacific contributed to
    the modest improvement in gross margin. Other primary
    contributors to the improvement in gross profit margin were the
    net favorable effect of year over year changes in foreign
    currency hedge gains and losses and manufacturing productivity
    gains offset by underlying exposure gains and losses, increased
    inventory charges due to the impact of our newer products on
    aging product lines and increased royalty expenses as a
    percentage of sales due to a higher mix of royalty bearing sales.

Operating
    Expenses

Research and Development, or R&D, as a percentage of net
    sales was 5.4 percent for 2006, compared to
    5.3 percent in 2005. R&D increased to
    $188.3 million for 2006 from $175.5 million in 2005,
    reflecting increased spending on projects focused on our
    redefined corporate strategies.

Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, as a
    percentage of net sales was 38.8 percent for 2006, compared
    to 38.3 percent in 2005. Share-based compensation added
    $55.9 million of expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, or an additional 1.6 percentage
    points when compared with 2005 due to the adoption of
    SFAS 123(R) in 2006. Absent share-based compensation,
    SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased. The decrease
    was primarily due to sales growth, realized expense synergies
    and well controlled spending.

Acquisition, integration and other items for 2006 were
    $6.1 million compared to $56.6 million in 2005, and
    included $27.7 million of income related to three unrelated
    matters – the sale of the former Centerpulse Austin
    land and facilities for a gain of $5.1 million and the
    favorable settlement of two pre-acquisition contingent
    liabilities. A reduction in product liability accounted for
    $4.9 million of income. Expense items included a
    $13.4 million impairment charge for certain Centerpulse
    tradename and trademark intangibles based principally in our
    Europe operating segment, $8.8 million of integration
    consulting expenses, $3.3 million of employee severance and
    retention costs, $3.0 million of costs related to
    integrating our information technology systems,
    $2.9 million of in-process research and development,
    $2.5 million of personnel expenses and travel for full-time
    integration team members and $4.8 million of other expenses.

Operating
    Profit, Income Taxes and Net Earnings

Operating profit for 2006 increased 10 percent to
    $1,165.2 million, from $1,055.0 million in 2005.
    Increased sales, improved gross profit margins, realized
    operating expense synergies, controlled operating expenses and
    decreased acquisition and integration expenses offset
    $76.0 million of share-based compensation expense to drive
    the increase in operating profit.

The effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes and
    minority interest decreased to 28.6 percent for 2006, down
    from 29.5 percent in 2005. The reasons for the lower
    effective tax rate were the implementation of several European
    restructuring initiatives, the successful negotiation of a lower
    ongoing Swiss tax rate (from approximately 24 percent to
    12.5 percent) and the continued expansion of operations in
    lower tax jurisdictions, including Puerto Rico.

Net earnings increased 14 percent to $834.5 million
    for 2006, compared to $732.5 million in 2005. The increase
    was due to higher operating profit, lower acquisition,
    integration and other expenses, decreased interest expense due
    to a lower average outstanding debt balance and a lower
    effective tax rate, offset by $54.5 million of share-based
    compensation expense, net of tax. Basic and diluted earnings per
    share increased 16 percent to $3.43 and $3.40,
    respectively, from $2.96 and $2.93 in 2005.

OPERATING PROFIT
    BY SEGMENT

Management evaluates operating segment performance based upon
    segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses
    pertaining to global operations and corporate expenses,
    share-based compensation expense, settlement expense,
    acquisition, integration and other expenses, inventory

step-up,

in-process research and development write-offs and intangible
    asset amortization expense. Global operations include research,
    development engineering, medical education, brand management,
    corporate legal, finance, and human resource functions, and
    U.S. and Puerto Rico based manufacturing operations and
    logistics. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated from
    segment operating profit. For more information regarding our
    segments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial

expansion of our U.S. distributor network. These increases
    were partially offset by improved gross margins.

Europe operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased
    primarily as a result of decreased gross margins from the impact
    of losses from foreign currency hedges. The decrease in gross
    margin was partially offset by controlled spending.

Asia Pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales
    increased primarily due to improved gross margins. Gross margins
    increased throughout many Asia Pacific markets, including Japan,
    despite decreases in average selling prices in Japan as a result
    of reductions in government controlled reimbursement prices. The
    improvement in gross margins in Asia Pacific is due to favorable
    product sales mix and lower unit manufacturing costs.

Year Ended
    December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31,

In the Americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales
    increased due to the effective control of operating expenses,
    including realized expense synergies and controlled selling,
    general and administrative spending.

European operating profit as a percentage of net sales improved
    due to improved gross margin and the realization of expense
    synergies related to the elimination of redundant functions and
    controlled selling, general and administrative spending.

Asia Pacific operating profit as a percentage of net sales
    increased primarily due to product category mix, and controlled
    selling, general and administrative spending.

LIQUIDITY AND
    CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows provided by operating activities were
    $1,084.4 million in 2007 compared to $1,040.7 million
    in 2006. The principal source of cash was net earnings of
    $773.2 million. In 2007, cash provided from net earnings
    was reduced by $169.5 million as a result of the settlement
    with the Department of Justice. Non-cash charges included in net
    earnings accounted for another $364.5 million of operating
    cash. All other items of operating cash flows accounted for a
    use of $53.3 million of cash pertaining principally to
    investments in working capital in support of sales growth. Also
    included in operating cash flows for 2007 is approximately
    $23 million related to accrued but unpaid amounts under
    various contractual arrangements with healthcare professionals
    or institutions. Operating cash flows were increased and cash
    flows used in financing activities were decreased by
    $13.6 million when compared with amounts furnished in the
    current report filed on Form

8-K

dated
    January 29, 2008.

We continue to focus on working capital management. At
    December 31, 2007, we had 52 days of sales outstanding
    in trade accounts receivable, a decrease of 3 days when
    compared to December 31, 2006. The improvement was achieved
    through improvement in all reporting segments. At
    December 31, 2007, we had 258 days of inventory on
    hand, favorable to December 31, 2006 by 19 days. This
    decrease reflects higher cost of goods sold and strong
    underlying demand in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our inventory
    levels have improved from a third quarter high of 330 days
    as a result of seasonal demand patterns.

Cash flows used in investing activities were $491.5 million
    in 2007, compared to $287.0 million in 2006. The most
    significant contributor to the increase in cash flows used in
    investing activities were the payments related to the
    acquisitions of Endius and ORTHOsoft as well as additions to our
    global distributor network. Cash payments related to
    acquisitions for 2007 was $160.3 million compared to
    $34.9 million in 2006. Additions to instruments during 2007
    were $138.5 million compared to $126.2 million in
    2006. Additions to instruments increased in 2007 compared to
    2006 due to an increase in instrument deployments related to new
    product launches. In 2008, we expect to spend approximately
    $155 – $170 million on instruments to support new
    products, sales growth and

MIS

Procedures. Additions to
    other property, plant and equipment during 2007 were
    $192.7 million compared to $142.1 million in 2006.
    Increases were related to facility expansions in Warsaw,
    Indiana; Ponce, Puerto Rico; and Winterthur, Switzerland; and
    investment in new information technology systems. These facility
    expansions improved working conditions and capabilities for our
    research and development organization, responded to increased
    demand and the transfer of production to our other manufacturing
    sites. During 2008, we expect to purchase approximately
    $315-$330 million in other property, plant and equipment,
    under our planned infrastructure improvements and international
    manufacturing expansion.

Cash flows used in financing activities were $399.5 million
    for 2007, compared to $730.7 million in 2006. We
    repurchased $576.3 million of our common stock in 2007 as
    compared with $798.8 million in 2006 under our stock
    repurchase programs. We utilized cash generated from operating
    activities and $149.8 million in cash proceeds received
    from employee stock compensation plans to fund the repurchases.
    We may use excess cash to fund future purchases, if any, under
    our stock repurchase programs.

We have a five year $1,350 million revolving,
    multi-currency, senior unsecured credit facility maturing
    November 30, 2012 (the “Senior Credit Facility”).
    We had $104.3 million outstanding under the Senior Credit
    Facility at December 31, 2007, and an availability of
    $1,245.7 million. The $104.3 million is for use in
    Japan and carries a low interest rate. The Senior Credit
    Facility contains provisions by which we can increase the line
    to $1,750 million and request that the maturity date be
    extended for two additional one-year periods.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the
    borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes
    and bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus an applicable
    margin determined by reference to our senior unsecured long-term
    credit rating and the amounts drawn under the Senior Credit
    Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a fixed rate
    determined through a competitive bid process. The Senior Credit
    Facility contains

customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of
    default for an unsecured financing arrangement, including, among
    other things, limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales
    of assets. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio
    of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to
    1.0. If we fall below an investment grade credit rating,
    additional restrictions would result, including restrictions on
    investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were
    in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit
    Facility as of December 31, 2007. Commitments under the
    Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a
    facility and a utilization fee. The Senior Credit Facility is
    rated A- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
    and is not rated by Moody’s Investors’ Service, Inc.

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
    $70.4 million.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, together
    with available borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, are
    sufficient to meet our expected working capital, capital
    expenditure and debt service needs. Should investment
    opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet
    and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if
    necessary.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our financial results are affected by the selection and
    application of accounting policies and methods. Significant
    accounting policies which require management’s judgment are
    discussed below.

Excess Inventory and Instruments

– We must
    determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our
    inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at
    our carrying cost. Similarly, we must also determine if
    instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain
    undeployed as a result of excess supply. Reserves are
    established to effectively adjust inventory and instruments to
    net realizable value. To determine the appropriate level of
    reserves, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to
    historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our
    products and instrument systems and components. The basis for
    the determination is generally the same for all inventory and
    instrument items and categories except for

work-in-progress

inventory, which is recorded at cost. Obsolete or discontinued
    items are generally destroyed and completely written off.
    Management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves
    based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other
    factors on a regular basis.

Income Taxes

− We estimate income tax expense
    and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction.
    Realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction
    is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income
    sufficient to realize the benefits. We evaluate deferred tax
    assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances if
    it is determined to be “more likely than not” that the
    deferred tax benefit will not be realized. Federal income taxes
    are provided on the portion of the income of foreign
    subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. We
    operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions. We are subject to
    regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those
    jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended
    periods of time to resolve. We make use of all available
    information and make reasoned judgments regarding matters
    requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense,
    liabilities and reserves. We believe adequate provisions exist
    for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to
    review or audit.

Commitments and Contingencies

– Accruals for
    product liability and other claims are established with internal
    and external legal counsel based on current information and
    historical settlement information for claims, related fees and
    for claims incurred but not reported. We use an actuarial model
    to assist management in determining an appropriate level of
    accruals for product liability claims. Historical patterns of
    claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to
    arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in
    the actuarial model. The amounts established equate to less than
    5 percent of total liabilities and represent
    management’s best estimate of the ultimate costs that we
    will incur under the various contingencies.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

– We evaluate
    the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible
    assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate
    the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the
    carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events
    or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Significant assumptions are required to estimate
    the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably
    estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. As such,
    these fair valuation measurements use significant unobservable
    inputs as defined under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. Changes to
    these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges
    on these assets.

Share-based Payment

– We account for
    share-based payment expense in accordance with the fair value



ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS,
    INC.                                                                                                                                                              2007

ANNUAL REPORT

recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R). Under the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), share-based payment
    expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of
    the award and is recognized over the requisite service period.
    Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant
    date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life
    of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock.
    Additionally, we must estimate the amount of share-based awards
    that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate expected
    volatility based upon the implied volatility of our actively
    traded options. The expected life of stock options and estimated
    forfeitures are based upon our employees’ historical
    exercise and forfeiture behaviors. The assumptions used in
    determining the grant date fair value and the expected
    forfeitures represent management’s best estimates.

ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

MARKET
    RISK

We are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing
    business operations, including risks from changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices
    that could affect our financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these and other market
    risks through regular operating and financing activities, and
    through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use
    derivative financial instruments solely as risk management tools
    and not for speculative investment purposes.

FOREIGN CURRENCY
    EXCHANGE RISK

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that
    our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
    could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates. We are primarily exposed to foreign currency
    exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and net assets
    denominated in Euros, Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen, British
    Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars and Korean Won. We
    manage the foreign currency exposure centrally, on a combined
    basis, which allows us to net exposures and to take advantage of
    any natural offsets. To reduce the uncertainty of foreign
    exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign
    currencies, we enter into derivative financial instruments in
    the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major
    financial institutions. These forward contracts are designed to
    hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily
    intercompany sale and purchase transactions, for periods
    consistent with commitments. Realized and unrealized gains and
    losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are
    temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income, then
    recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item affects
    net earnings.

For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007, we had
    obligations to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros,
    Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian
    Dollars and Korean Won or purchase Swiss Francs and sell
    U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January
    2008 through May 2010. The notional amounts of outstanding
    forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase
    U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2007 and 2006, were
    $1,244.6 million and $1,169.3 million, respectively.
    The notional amounts of outstanding forward contracts entered
    into with third parties to purchase Swiss Francs at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $138.4 million and
    $205.0 million, respectively. The weighted average contract
    rates outstanding are Euro:USD 1.34, USD:Swiss Franc 1.19,
    USD:Japanese Yen 109, British Pound:USD 1.92, USD:Canadian
    Dollar 1.09, Australian Dollar:USD 0.78 and USD:Korean Won 929.

We maintain written policies and procedures governing our risk
    management activities. Our policy requires that critical terms
    of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted
    transactions. On this basis, with respect to cash flow hedges,
    changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are
    generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the
    fair value of hedge instruments. As part of our risk management
    program, we also perform sensitivity analyses to assess
    potential changes in revenue, operating results, cash flows and
    financial position relating to hypothetical movements in
    currency exchange rates. A sensitivity analysis of changes in
    the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding
    at December 31, 2007, indicated that, if the
    U.S. Dollar uniformly changed in value by 10 percent
    relative to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound,
    Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar and Korean Won, with no
    change in the interest differentials, the fair value of those
    contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income
    taxes in periods through 2010, depending on the direction of the
    change, by an average approximate amount of $78.4 million,
    $13.1 million, $20.4 million, $14.6 million,
    $5.3 million, $6.5 million and $2.0 million for
    the Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian
    Dollar, Australian Dollar and Korean Won contracts,
    respectively. Any change in the fair value of foreign exchange
    forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency
    exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in
    the value of the hedged transaction. Consequently, foreign
    exchange contracts would not subject us to material risk due to
    exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these
    contracts offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities,
    and transactions being hedged.

We had net investment exposures to net foreign currency
    denominated assets and liabilities of approximately
    $1,869.1 million at December 31, 2007, primarily in
    Swiss Francs, Japanese Yen and Euros. Approximately
    $1,178 million of the net asset exposure at
    December 31, 2007 relates to goodwill recorded in the
    Europe and Asia Pacific geographic segments.

We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
    terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets and
    liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
    entity’s functional currency. As a result, foreign currency
    translation gains/losses recognized in earnings under
    SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”
    are generally offset with gain/losses on the foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period.

COMMODITY PRICE
    RISK

We purchase raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome,
    titanium, tantalum, polymer and sterile packaging. We enter into
    supply contracts generally with terms of 12 to 24 months,
    where available, on these commodities to alleviate the effect of
    market fluctuation in prices. As part of our risk management
    program, we perform sensitivity analyses related to potential
    commodity price changes. A 10 percent price change across
    all these commodities would not have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

ANNUAL REPORT

INTEREST RATE
    RISK

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risk
    from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of
    operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure to
    interest rate risks through our regular operations and financing
    activities.

Presently, we invest our cash and equivalents primarily in
    U.S. government treasury funds and bank deposits. The
    primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation
    of our invested principal funds by limiting default and market
    risk. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments
    in our investment portfolio.

Our principal exposure to interest rate risk arises from the
    variable rates associated with our credit facilities. We are
    subject to interest rate risk through movements in interest
    rates on the committed Senior Credit Facility and our
    uncommitted credit facilities. Presently, all of our debt
    outstanding bears interest at short-term rates. We currently do
    not hedge our interest rate exposure, but may do so in the
    future. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of
    December 31, 2007, a change of 10 percent in interest
    rates, assuming the amount outstanding remains constant, would
    not have a material effect on interest expense. Further, this
    analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level
    of overall economic activity that could exist in such an
    environment.

CREDIT
    RISK

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
    concentrations of credit risk, are primarily cash, cash
    equivalents, counterparty transactions, and accounts receivable.

We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions
    and money market instruments, and limit the amount of credit
    exposure to any one entity. We believe we do not have any
    significant credit risk on our cash and equivalents and
    investments.

We are exposed to credit loss if the financial institutions with
    which we conduct business fail to perform. However, this loss is
    limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the
    counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed our
    obligation. We also minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing
    with a diversified group of major financial institutions. We
    manage credit risk by monitoring the financial condition of our
    counterparties using standard credit guidelines. We do not
    anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
    receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and
    their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by
    frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to
    whom credit is granted in the normal course of business.
    However, essentially all of our trade receivables are
    concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare
    industry in the U.S. and internationally or with
    distributors or dealers who operate in international markets
    and, accordingly, are exposed to their respective business,
    economic and country specific variables. Repayment is dependent
    upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the
    respective countries’ national economic and healthcare
    systems. Exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit
    approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures and we
    believe that reserves for losses are adequate. There is no
    significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other
    major concentration of credit risk.

Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of Zimmer Holdings, Inc. is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers and effected by the company’s Board of Directors,
    management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

The company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, the
    company’s management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

.

Based on that assessment, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2007, the company’s internal control over
    financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

The company’s independent registered public accounting firm
    has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
    as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board
    of Directors of Zimmer Holdings, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of Zimmer
    Holdings, Inc, and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
    index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein when read
    in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
    statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
    responsible for these financial statements and financial
    statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control
    over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express opinions on these financial statements, on the
    financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
    control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain tax positions in 2007. As discussed in
    Notes 3 and 10, respectively, to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for share-based compensation in 2006 and defined benefit pension
    and other postretirement plans effective December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BUSINESS

We design, develop, manufacture and market reconstructive
    orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal
    implants, trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical
    products. We also provide other healthcare related services.
    Joint reconstructive implants restore function lost due to
    disease or trauma in joints such as knees, hips, shoulders and
    elbows. Dental reconstructive implants restore function and
    aesthetics in patients that have lost teeth due to trauma or
    disease. Spinal implants are utilized by orthopaedic surgeons
    and neurosurgeons in the treatment of degenerative diseases,
    deformities and trauma in all regions of the spine. Trauma
    products are devices used primarily to reattach or stabilize
    damaged bone and tissue to support the body’s natural
    healing process. Our related orthopaedic surgical products
    include surgical supplies and instruments designed to aid in
    orthopaedic surgical procedures and post-operation
    rehabilitation. We have operations in more than 25 countries and
    market our products in more than 100 countries. We operate in a
    single industry but have three reportable geographic segments,
    the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific.

The words “we”, “us”, “our” and
    similar words refer to Zimmer Holdings, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to the parent company only.

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

– The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of Zimmer Holdings and
    its subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling equity
    position. Investments in companies in which we exercise
    significant influence over the operating and financial affairs,
    but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method.
    Under the equity method, we record the investment at cost and
    adjust the carrying amount of the investment by our
    proportionate share of the investee’s net earnings or
    losses. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
    are eliminated. Certain amounts in the 2006 consolidated
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
    2007 presentation.

Use of Estimates

– The consolidated financial
    statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that
    are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

– The financial
    statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into
    U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and
    liabilities and average exchange rates for operating results.
    Unrealized translation gains and losses are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’
    equity. When a transaction is denominated in a currency other
    than the subsidiary’s functional currency, we recognize a
    transaction gain or loss when the transaction is settled.
    Foreign currency transaction gains and losses included in net
    earnings for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were not significant.

Revenue Recognition

– We sell product through
    three principal channels: 1) direct to healthcare
    institutions, referred to as direct channel accounts,
    2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers and
    3) directly to dental practices and dental laboratories.
    The direct channel accounts represent approximately
    80 percent of our net sales. Through this channel,
    inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers so
    that products are available when needed for surgical procedures.
    No revenue is recognized upon the placement of inventory into
    consignment as we retain title and maintain the inventory on our
    balance sheet. Upon implantation, we issue an invoice and
    revenue is recognized. Pricing for products is generally
    predetermined by contracts with customers, agents acting on
    behalf of customer groups or by government regulatory bodies,
    depending on the market. Price discounts under group purchasing
    contracts are generally linked to volume of implant purchases by
    customer healthcare institutions within a specified group. At
    negotiated thresholds within a contract buying period, price
    discounts may increase. Revenue is recognized on sales to
    stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices and
    dental laboratories, which account for approximately
    20 percent of our net sales, when title to product passes
    to them, generally upon shipment. Product is generally sold to
    distributors at fixed prices for specified periods. A
    distributor may return product in the event that we terminate
    the relationship. Under those circumstances, we record an
    estimated sales return in the period in which constructive
    notice of termination is given to a distributor. Product returns
    were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005.

The reserves for doubtful accounts were $21.7 million and
    $20.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Shipping and Handling

– Amounts billed to
    customers for shipping and handling of products are reflected in
    net sales, and are not significant. Expenses incurred related to
    shipping and handling of products are reflected in selling,
    general and administrative and were $104.1 million,
    $95.5 million and $91.6 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Acquisition, Integration and Other

– We
    recognize incremental expenses resulting directly from our
    business combinations and significant nonrecurring items as
    “Acquisition, integration and other” expenses.
    Acquisition, integration and other expenses for the years ended

In-process research and development charges for 2007 are related
    to the acquisitions of Endius and ORTHOsoft. Included in the
    gain/loss on disposition or impairment of acquired assets and
    obligations for 2006 is the sale of the former Centerpulse
    Austin land and facilities for a gain of $5.1 million and
    the favorable settlement of two pre-acquisition contingent
    liabilities. These gains were offset by a $13.4 million
    impairment charge for certain Centerpulse tradename and
    trademark intangibles based principally in our Europe operating
    segment.

Cash and Equivalents

– We consider all highly
    liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
    less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in
    the balance sheet for cash and equivalents are valued at cost,
    which approximates their fair value. Restricted cash is
    primarily composed of cash held in escrow related to certain
    insurance coverage.

Inventories

– Inventories, net of allowances
    for obsolete and slow-moving goods, are stated at the lower of
    cost or market, with cost determined on a

first-in

first-out basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

– Property, plant
    and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
    estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and
    improvements, three to eight years for machinery and equipment
    and generally five years for instruments. Maintenance and
    repairs are expensed as incurred. In accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
    Long-Lived Assets,” we review property, plant and equipment
    for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
    recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
    estimated future undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset
    are less than its carrying amount. An impairment loss is
    measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset
    exceeds its fair value.

Software Costs

– We capitalize certain computer
    software and software development costs incurred in connection
    with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use
    when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is
    probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized
    software costs generally include external direct costs of
    materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining
    computer software and compensation and related benefits for
    employees who are directly associated with the software project.
    Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and
    equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line
    basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives
    of the software, which approximate three to seven years.

Instruments

– Instruments are hand held devices
    used by orthopaedic surgeons during total joint replacement and
    other surgical procedures. Instruments are recognized as
    long-lived assets and are included in property, plant and
    equipment. Undeployed instruments are carried at cost, net of
    allowances for excess and obsolete instruments. Instruments in
    the field are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on
    average estimated useful lives, determined principally in
    reference to associated product life cycles, primarily five
    years. We review instruments for impairment in accordance with
    SFAS No. 144. Depreciation of instruments is
    recognized as selling, general and administrative expense.

Goodwill

– We account for goodwill in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill has been assigned
    to reporting units, which are consistent with our operating
    segments. We perform annual impairment tests by comparing each
    reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying amount to
    determine if there is potential impairment. We perform this test
    in the fourth quarter of the year. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment
    loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of
    the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying value of
    the reporting unit goodwill. The fair value of the reporting
    unit and the implied fair value of goodwill are determined based
    upon market multiples.

Intangible Assets

– We account for intangible
    assets in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Intangible
    assets are initially measured at their fair value. We have
    determined the fair value of our intangible assets either by the
    fair value of the consideration exchanged for the intangible
    asset, or the estimated after-tax discounted cash flows expected
    to be generated from the intangible asset. Intangible assets
    with an indefinite life, including certain trademarks and trade
    names, are not amortized. The useful lives of indefinite life
    intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether
    events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life.
    Intangible assets with a finite life, including core and
    developed technology, certain trademarks and trade names,

    HOLDINGS,
    INC.                                                                                                                                                              2007

FORM 10-K

ANNUAL REPORT

Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements

(Continued)

customer related intangibles and patents and licenses are
    amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
    life, ranging from three to forty years. Intangible assets with
    an indefinite life are tested for impairment annually, or
    whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized
    if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the
    asset. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be
    determined based upon the excess of the asset’s carrying
    value over its fair value. Intangible assets with a finite life
    are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

The useful lives of intangible assets range from 3 to
    40 years. In determining the useful lives of intangible
    assets, we consider the expected use of the assets and the
    effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, anticipated
    technological advances, changes in surgical techniques, market
    influences and other economic factors. For technology based
    intangible assets, we consider the expected life cycles of
    products, absent unforeseen technological advances, which
    incorporate the corresponding technology. Trademarks and trade
    names that do not have a wasting characteristic (i.e., there are
    no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or
    other factors which limit the useful life) are assigned an
    indefinite life. Trademarks and trade names that are related to
    products expected to be phased out are assigned lives consistent
    with the period in which the products bearing each brand are
    expected to be sold. For customer relationship intangible
    assets, we assign useful lives based upon historical levels of
    customer attrition.

Research and Development

– We expense all
    research and development costs as incurred. Research and
    development costs include salaries, prototypes, depreciation of
    equipment used in research and development, consultant fees and
    amounts paid to collaborative partners.

Income Taxes

– We account for income taxes in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
    Income Taxes” and related interperations, including
    FIN 48. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
    based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases
    of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
    rates in effect for the years in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. Federal income taxes are provided on the
    portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected
    to be remitted to the U.S.

Derivative Financial Instruments

– We account
    for all derivative financial instruments in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended by
    SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
    Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 133)” and SFAS No. 149,
    “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities”. SFAS No. 133 requires that
    all derivative instruments be reported as assets or liabilities
    on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. We maintain
    written policies and procedures that permit, under appropriate
    circumstances and subject to proper authorization, the use of
    derivative financial instruments solely for hedging purposes.
    The use of derivative financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes is prohibited by our policy. We are exposed
    to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. As a
    result, we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to offset
    the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on anticipated foreign
    currency transactions, generally intercompany sales and
    purchases expected to occur within the next twelve to thirty
    months. Derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges
    are designated as such from inception. We maintain formal
    documentation regarding our objectives, the nature of the risk
    being hedged, identification of the instrument, the hedged
    transaction, the hedging relationship and how effectiveness of
    the hedging instrument will be assessed. Our policy requires
    that critical terms of a hedging instrument are effectively the
    same as a hedged forecasted transaction. On this basis, with
    respect to a cash flow hedge, changes in cash flows attributable
    to the hedged transaction are generally expected to be
    completely offset by the cash flows attributable to hedge
    instruments. We, therefore, perform quarterly assessments of
    hedge effectiveness by verifying and documenting those critical
    terms of the hedge instrument and that forecasted transactions
    have not changed. We also assess on a quarterly basis whether
    there have been adverse developments regarding the risk of a
    counterparty default. For derivatives which qualify as hedges of
    future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair
    value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and
    then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged item
    affects net earnings. The ineffective portion of a
    derivative’s change in fair value, if any, is reported in
    cost of products sold immediately. The net amount recognized in
    earnings during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
    2005, due to ineffectiveness and amounts excluded from the
    assessment of hedge effectiveness, was not significant.

For contracts outstanding at December 31, 2007, we have an
    obligation to purchase U.S. Dollars and sell Euros,
    Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian
    Dollars and Korean Won and purchase Swiss Francs and sell
    U.S. Dollars at set maturity dates ranging from January
    2008 through May 2010. The notional amounts of outstanding
    forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase
    U.S. Dollars at December 31, 2007 were
    $1,244.6 million. The notional amounts of outstanding
    forward contracts entered into with third parties to purchase
    Swiss Francs at December 31, 2007, were
    $138.4 million. The fair value of outstanding derivative
    instruments recorded on the balance sheet at December 31,
    2007, together with settled derivatives where the hedged item
    has not yet affected earnings, was a net unrealized loss of
    $55.8 million, or $45.4 million net of taxes, which is
    deferred in other comprehensive income, of

    HOLDINGS,
    INC.                                                                                                                                                              2007

which, $44.9 million, or $38.2 million, net of taxes,
    is expected to be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve
    months.

We also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts
    with terms of one month to manage currency exposures for assets
    and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an
    entity’s functional currency. As a result, any foreign
    currency translation gains/losses recognized in earnings under
    SFAS No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”
    are generally offset with gains/losses on the foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts in the same reporting period.

Other Comprehensive Income

– Other
    comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and
    losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are
    included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net
    earnings as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment
    to stockholders’ equity. Other comprehensive income is
    comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments,
    unrealized foreign currency hedge gains and losses, unrealized
    gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and
    amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and
    losses in actuarial assumptions.

Treasury Stock

– We account for repurchases of

    a reduction of shareholders equity. We may reissue common stock
    held in treasury only for limited purposes.

Accounting Pronouncements

– In June 2006, the
    FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FAS 109,
    Accounting for Income Taxes” (FIN 48), to create a
    single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax
    positions. See our income tax disclosures in Note 11 for
    more information regarding the adoption of FIN 48.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” This Statement
    requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in
    the statement of financial position. SFAS No. 158 also
    requires recognition in other comprehensive income of certain
    gains and losses that arise during the period but are deferred
    under pension accounting rules, as well as modifies the timing
    of reporting and adds certain disclosures. The Statement
    provides recognition and disclosure elements to be effective as
    of the end of the fiscal year after December 15, 2006 and
    measurement elements to be effective for fiscal years ending
    after December 15, 2008. We adopted SFAS No. 158
    on December 31, 2006. See our pension and other
    postretirement disclosures in Note 10.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment”, which is a revision to
    SFAS No. 123. SFAS 123(R) requires all
    share-based payments to employees, including stock options, to
    be expensed based on their fair values. We adopted
    SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified
    prospective method and did not restate prior periods.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”, which defines fair value,
    establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
    accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. This Statement does not require any new
    fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure
    fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify
    the source of the information. SFAS No. 157 is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued
    FASB Staff Position (FSP)

No. SFAS 157-2,

which delays the effective date of certain provisions of
    SFAS No. 157 relating to non-financial assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis
    until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial statements or
    results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities – Including an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS No. 159).
    SFAS No. 159 creates a “fair value option”
    under which an entity may elect to record certain financial
    assets or liabilities at fair value upon their initial
    recognition. Subsequent changes in fair value would be
    recognized in earnings as those changes occur. The election of
    the fair value option would be made on a

contract-by-contract

basis and would need to be supported by concurrent documentation
    or a preexisting documented policy. SFAS No. 159
    requires an entity to separately disclose the fair

value of these items on the balance sheet or in the footnotes to
    the financial statements and to provide information that would
    allow the financial statement user to understand the impact on
    earnings from the changes in the fair value.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on our
    financial position or results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations”, which is a revision of
    SFAS 141. SFAS 141(R) will change the way in which we
    account for business combinations. The Statement introduces new
    purchase accounting concepts, expands the use of fair value
    accounting related to business combinations and changes the
    subsequent period accounting for certain acquired assets and
    liabilities, among other things. SFAS No. 141(R) will
    be applied prospectively on business combinations with
    acquisition dates in fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, and therefore this statement will not
    affect our financial statements for business combinations that
    preceded the effective date. For deferred tax assets and income
    tax reserves recorded as part of business combinations, these
    assets will be accounted for under SFAS 109 and FIN 48
    after the effective date regardless of the acquisition date.
    Therefore, if a remeasurement of those assets and liabilities is
    warranted after the effective date of this statement, it may
    affect our income tax expense in the period in which the
    remeasurement occurs.

In December 2007, the FASB also issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB 51”. SFAS No. 160
    will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests,
    which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and
    classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160
    requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure
    requirements for existing minority interests.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    on or after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within
    those fiscal years. We do not expect that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 160 will have a material impact on our
    consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Our share-based payments primarily consist of stock options,
    restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance
    shares and an employee stock purchase plan. We did not grant any
    RSUs or performance shares until 2006. Prior to January 1,
    2006, we accounted for share-based payments under APB Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,” and related Interpretations (“APB
    25”). Under APB 25, share-based payment expense was not
    significant because the exercise price of the stock options
    generally equaled the market price of the underlying stock on
    the measurement date of the stock options and we had awarded few
    shares of restricted stock and no RSUs or performance shares. No
    share-based payment expense was reflected in net income for the
    employee stock purchase plan under the provisions of APB 25, as
    the employee purchase price discount met the acceptable
    thresholds under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.

We have elected the modified prospective method for adopting
    SFAS 123(R). Under the modified prospective method, the
    provisions of SFAS 123(R) apply to all share-based payments
    granted or modified after the date of adoption. For share-based
    payments granted prior to the date of the adoption, the
    unrecognized expense related to the unvested portion at the date
    of adoption will be recognized in net earnings under the grant
    date fair value provisions used for our pro forma disclosures
    under SFAS 123. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    share-based payment expense was $70.1 million or
    $48.1 million net of the related tax benefits. For the year
    ended December 31, 2006, share-based payment expense was
    $76.0 million or $54.5 million net of the related tax
    benefits. Share-based payment expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 under APB 25 was not significant. The
    following is the pro forma expense disclosure under
    SFAS 123 for the year ended December 31, 2005 (in
    millions, except per share amounts):

Prior to adopting SFAS 123(R), we classified all tax
    benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of
    non-qualified stock options as operating cash flows.
    SFAS 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from excess
    tax benefits (i.e., tax deductions realized for stock options
    exercised in excess of the tax benefit recognized on the related
    share-based payment expense) to be classified as financing cash
    flows.

Stock
    Options

We had three equity compensation plans in effect at
    December 31, 2007: the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the
    “2006 Plan”), the TeamShare Stock Option Plan and the
    Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The 2006 Plan replaced
    the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2001 Plan”), which
    by its terms expired in August 2006. Following stockholder
    approval of the 2006 Plan in May 2006, no further awards were
    granted under the 2001 Plan. However, vested and unvested stock
    options previously granted under the 2001 Plan remained
    outstanding

as of December 31, 2007. We have reserved the maximum
    number of shares of common stock available for award under the
    terms of each of these plans and have registered
    52.9 million shares of common stock. The 2006 Plan provides
    for the grant of nonqualified stock options and incentive stock
    options, long-term performance awards in the form of performance
    shares or units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and
    stock appreciation rights. The Compensation and Management
    Development Committee of the Board of Directors determines the
    grant date for annual grants under our equity compensation
    plans. The date for annual grants under the 2006 Plan to our
    executive officers is expected to occur in February of each year
    following the earnings announcements for the previous quarter
    and full year. The TeamShare Stock Option Plan provides for the
    grant of non-qualified stock options and, in certain
    jurisdictions, stock appreciation rights, while the Stock Plan
    for Non-Employee Directors provides for awards of stock options,
    restricted stock and restricted stock units to non-employee
    directors. It has been our practice to issue shares of common
    stock upon exercise of stock options from previously unissued
    shares. The total number of awards which may be granted in a
    given year

and/or

over
    the life of the plan under each of our equity compensation plans
    is limited. At December 31, 2007, an aggregate of
    14.4 million shares were available for future grants and
    awards under these plans.

Stock options granted to date under our plans generally vest
    over four years. We recognize expense related to stock options
    on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire
    award, less awards expected to be forfeited using estimated
    forfeiture rates. Stock options are granted with an exercise
    price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date
    of grant, except in limited circumstances where local law may
    dictate otherwise. In the past, certain options have had price
    thresholds, which affect exercisability. All such price
    thresholds have been satisfied. The total number of awards which
    may be granted in a given year

and/or

over
    the life of the plan under each of our stock option plans is
    limited to control dilution.

We use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the
    fair value of our stock options. For stock options granted
    during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, expected
    volatility was derived from the implied volatility of our traded
    options that were actively traded around the grant date of the
    stock options with exercise prices similar to the stock options
    and maturities of over one year. In periods prior to
    January 1, 2006, expected volatility was derived based upon
    historical volatility of our common stock. The change in
    determining the expected volatility assumption was based upon
    our traded options with maturities over one year being more
    actively traded than in the past along with the guidance
    provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Staff
    Accounting Bulletin No. 107. The expected term of the
    stock options has been derived from historical employee exercise
    behavior. The risk-free interest rate is determined using the
    implied yield currently available for zero-coupon
    U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the
    expected life of the options. A dividend yield of zero percent
    has been used as we have not paid a dividend since becoming a
    public company in 2001.

The weighted average fair value of the options granted in the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    determined using the following assumptions:

The weighted average fair value for options granted during 2007,
    2006 and 2005 were $22.60, $22.32 and $28.11, respectively. The
    total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the
    years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    $124.5 million, $40.5 million and $109.2 million,
    respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, share-based payment expense related to stock options was
    $73.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively, or
    $50.4 million and $47.7 million net of the related tax
    benefits, respectively. For the year ended December 31,
    2006, the impact on basic and diluted EPS related to share-based
    payment expense on stock options was $0.19. Since prior to
    adoption of SFAS 123(R) the exercise price of stock options
    granted generally equaled the market price of the underlying
    stock on the measurement date, the expense related to stock
    options represents the impact of adopting this standard.

As of December 31, 2007, there was $111.4 million of

    stock options granted under our plans. That expense is expected
    to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    2.8 years.

Performance
    Shares and RSUs

We granted performance shares in 2006, the vesting of which
    depends on our achievement of objective performance targets over
    a three year period ended December 31, 2008. In addition,
    we granted performance-based RSUs in July 2007, the vesting of
    which depends on our achievement of objective performance
    targets over an 18 month period ended December 31,
    2008. To the extent our actual performance meets or exceeds the
    respective performance targets and the performance shares

and/or

RSUs
    are earned, they will generally vest at the end of the
    performance period ending December 31, 2008. We also
    granted RSUs in December 2007. These RSUs are not tied to our
    performance and will vest ratably on the first and second
    anniversaries of the date of grant, provided that the recipient
    is still our employee. Each of these awards will be converted
    into one share of our common stock upon vesting.

A summary of nonvested performance share and RSU activity for

The fair value of the awards was determined based upon the fair
    market value of our common stock on the date of grant.
    SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate the number of
    performance shares and RSUs that will vest, and recognize
    share-based payment expense on a straight line basis over the
    requisite service period. As of December 31, 2007, we
    estimate that approximately 418,000 performance shares and RSUs
    will vest. If our estimate were to change in the future, the
    cumulative effect of the change in estimate will be recorded in
    that period. Based upon the number of performance shares and
    RSUs that we expect to vest, the unrecognized share-based
    payment expense as of December 31, 2007 was
    $20.4 million, and is expected to be recognized over a
    period of 1.8 years. For the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006, pre-tax expense (income) related to these awards
    was $(3.3) million and $9.7 million, respectively, or
    $(2.3) million and $6.8 million net of the related tax
    benefits, respectively.

ACQUISITIONS

We have made acquisitions that took place during the years 2007
    and 2006, certain of which are described below. These
    acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
    accounting pursuant to SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations” (SFAS No. 141). Accordingly, the
    results of operations of the acquired companies have been
    included in our consolidated results of operations subsequent to
    the transaction dates, and the respective assets and liabilities
    of the acquired companies have been recorded at their estimated
    fair values in our consolidated statement of financial position
    as of the transaction dates, with any excess purchase price
    being allocated to goodwill. Pro forma financial information and
    other information required by SFAS No. 141 have not
    been included as the acquisitions did not have a material impact
    upon our financial position or results of operations.

ORTHOsoft

    ORTHOsoft bolsters our SmartTools strategic initiative to bring
    innovative tools to the marketplace that will help create better
    and more reproducible outcomes for surgeons and patients.

Endius
    Incorporated

In April 2007, we acquired Endius Incorporated (Endius), a
    privately held spinal products company based in Massachusetts,
    for an aggregate value of approximately $80 million in
    cash, before adjustments for debt repayment and other items. We
    recorded $42.3 million in goodwill in connection with the
    acquisition. Endius develops and manufactures minimally invasive
    spine surgery products, implants and techniques to treat spine
    disease. The acquisition of Endius has expanded our spine
    product portfolio to include innovative minimally invasive
    instruments and implants.

Musculoskeletal
    Management Systems, LLC

In June 2006, we acquired Musculoskeletal Management Systems,
    LLC, more commonly known as the Human Motion Institute (HMI), a
    privately-held, hospital-focused consulting company based in
    Pennsylvania for a cash purchase price of $15.0 million. We
    recorded $13.0 million of goodwill in connection with the

During the year ended December 31, 2007, goodwill was
    reduced by $61.4 million related to the adoption of
    FIN 48 and increased by $83.6 million related to the
    acquisitions of Endius, ORTHOsoft and a foreign-based
    distributor. During the year ended December 31, 2006,
    goodwill was reduced by $51.5 million related to changes in
    the fair value estimates of Centerpulse. $46.0 million of
    this reduction was a decrease to the long term tax liability
    related to the expiration of the applicable statute of
    limitations. The remaining reduction primarily relates to the
    release of valuation allowances.

DEBT

We have a five year $1,350 million senior credit agreement
    (the “Senior Credit Facility”). The Senior Credit
    Facility is a revolving, multi-currency, senior unsecured credit
    facility maturing November 30, 2012. Available borrowings
    under the Senior Credit Facility at December 31, 2007, were
    $1,245.7 million. The Senior Credit Facility contains
    provisions whereby borrowings may be increased to
    $1,750 million and the maturity date may be extended for up
    to two one-year periods.

We and certain of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries are the
    borrowers under the Senior Credit Facility. Borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a LIBOR-based rate plus
    an applicable margin determined by reference to our senior
    unsecured long-term credit rating and the amounts drawn under
    the Senior Credit Facility, at an alternate base rate, or at a
    fixed rate determined through a competitive bid process. The
    Senior Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and
    negative covenants and events of default for an unsecured
    financing arrangement, including, among other things,
    limitations on consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
    Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to
    1.0 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. If we
    fall below an investment grade credit rating, additional
    restrictions would result, including restrictions on
    investments, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. We were
    in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Credit
    Facility as of December 31, 2007. Commitments under the
    Senior Credit Facility are subject to certain fees, including a
    facility and a utilization fee.

Outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2007 was
    $104.3 million and $99.6 million as of
    December 31, 2006. We had no current debt as of
    December 31, 2007 or 2006.

We also have available uncommitted credit facilities totaling
    $70.4 million.

The weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the
    Senior Credit Facility was 1.17 percent at
    December 31, 2007. Borrowings under the Senior Credit
    Facility at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are Japanese Yen
    based borrowings. We paid $8.5 million, $5.8 million
    and $15.3 million in interest during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Debt issuance costs of $22.8 million were incurred to
    obtain the Senior Credit Facility arrangement. These costs were
    capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the lives
    of the related facility. At December 31, 2007, unamortized
    debt issuance costs were $4.4 million.

RETIREMENT AND
    POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain
    U.S. and Puerto Rico employees who were hired before
    September 2, 2002. Employees hired after September 2,
    2002 are not part of the U.S. defined benefit plans.
    Employees who had not become a member of the Puerto Rico defined
    benefit plans by March 1, 2004 are not part of the Puerto
    Rico defined benefit plans. The employees who are not
    participating in the defined benefit plans do receive additional
    benefits under our defined contribution plans. Plan benefits are
    primarily based on years of credited service and the
    participant’s average eligible compensation. In addition to
    the U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit pension plans, we
    sponsor various

non-U.S. pension

arrangements, including retirement and termination benefit plans
    required by local law or coordinated with government sponsored
    plans.

We also provide comprehensive medical and group life insurance
    benefits to certain U.S. and Puerto Rico eligible retirees
    who elect to participate in our comprehensive medical and group
    life plans. The medical plan is contributory, and the life
    insurance plan is non-contributory. No similar plans exist for
    employees outside the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Employees hired
    after September 2, 2002, are not eligible for retiree
    medical and life insurance benefits.

We use a December 31 measurement date for our benefit plans.

We adopted SFAS 158 (see Note 2 – Accounting
    Pronouncements) as of December 31, 2006. The adoption of
    SFAS 158 had the following effects on our consolidated
    balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 as we recognized the
    funded status of our defined benefit and postretirement benefit
    plans with a corresponding adjustment to Accumulated Other

The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets is based
    on the period expected benefits will be paid and the historical
    rates of return on the different asset classes held in the
    plans. The expected long-term rate of return is the weighted
    average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset
    class. We believe that historical asset results approximate
    expected market returns applicable to the funding of a long-term
    benefit obligation.

The U.S. and Puerto Rico defined benefit retirement
    plans’ overall investment strategy is to maximize total
    returns by emphasizing long-term growth of capital while
    avoiding risk. We have established target ranges of assets held
    by the plans of 50 to 75 percent for equity securities and
    25 to 50 percent for debt securities. The plans strive to
    have sufficiently diversified assets so that adverse or
    unexpected results from one asset class will not have an unduly
    detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. The investments in
    the plans are rebalanced quarterly based upon the target asset
    allocation of the plans.

The investment strategies of

non-U.S. based

plans vary according to the plan provisions and local laws. The
    majority of the assets in

non-U.S. based

plans are located in Switzerland based plans. These assets are
    held in trusts and are commingled with the assets of other Swiss
    companies, with representatives of all the companies making the
    investment decisions. The overall strategy is to maximize total
    returns while avoiding risk. The trustees of the assets have
    established target ranges of assets held by the plans of 30 to
    50 percent in debt securities, 20 to 37 percent in
    equity securities, 15 to 24 percent in real estate, 3 to
    15 percent in cash funds and 0 to 12 percent in other
    funds.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our defined benefit
    pension plans’ assets did not hold any direct investment in
    Zimmer Holdings common stock.

We expect that we will have no minimum funding requirements by
    law in 2008 for the qualified U.S. and Puerto Rico defined
    benefit retirement plans. However, we expect to voluntarily
    contribute between $20 million to $24 million to these
    plans during 2008. Additionally, we expect to contribute

A one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost
    trend rates would have no significant effect on the service and
    interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense
    and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The
    effect of a change in the healthcare cost trend rate is tempered
    by an annual cap that limits medical costs we pay.

Amounts recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive
    income that will be recognized as part of our postretirement
    benefit expense during 2008 are not expected to be material.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary

The vast majority of the net operating loss carryover is
    available to reduce future federal and state taxable earnings.
    At December 31, 2007, these net operating loss carryovers
    generally expire within a period of 1 to 19 years.
    Valuation allowances for net operating loss carryovers have been
    established in the amount of $16.3 million and
    $10.4 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively. The tax credit carryovers
    are entirely available to offset future federal and state tax
    liabilities. At December 31, 2007, these tax credit
    carryovers generally expire within a period of 1 to
    15 years. We have established valuation allowances for
    certain tax credit carryovers in the amount of
    $20.2 million and $15.0 million at December 31,
    2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The entire
    capital loss carryover is also available to reduce future
    federal taxable earnings; however, the capital loss carryover is
    subject to a valuation allowance and expires in 2 years.
    The remaining valuation allowances of $17.5 million and
    $8.4 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively, relate primarily to
    potential capital losses. We have established valuation
    allowances related to certain business combination transactions
    that, if not ultimately required, will result in a reduction of
    goodwill. These allowances were approximately $33.9 million
    and $29.0 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively.

At December 31, 2007, we had an aggregate of approximately
    $493 million of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries
    that have been, or are intended to be, indefinitely reinvested
    for continued use in foreign operations. If the total
    undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted, a
    significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the
    allowable foreign tax credits. It is not practical for us to
    determine the additional tax of remitting these earnings.

(Continued)

In September 2007, we reached a settlement with the United
    States Department of Justice in an ongoing investigation into
    financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers
    and consulting orthopaedic surgeons. Under the terms of the
    settlement, we paid a civil settlement amount of
    $169.5 million and we recorded an expense in that amount.
    No tax benefit has been recorded related to the settlement
    expense due to the uncertainty as to the tax treatment. We
    intend to pursue resolution of this uncertainty with taxing
    authorities, but are unable to ascertain the outcome or timing
    for such resolution at this time. For more information regarding
    the settlement, see Note 15.

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FIN 48).
    FIN 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits
    claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be
    recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, we may
    recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
    it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
    sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
    technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in
    the financial statements from such a position should be measured
    based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty
    percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
    FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties on income taxes,
    accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.

We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007.  Prior
    to the adoption of FIN 48 we had a long term tax liability
    for expected settlement of various federal, state and foreign
    income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary
    tax impact of these expected settlements of $102.1 million,
    as well as a separate accrued interest liability of
    $1.7 million. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48,
    we are required to present the different components of such
    liability on a gross basis versus the historical net
    presentation. The adoption resulted in the financial statement
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by
    $6.4 million as of January 1, 2007. The adoption
    resulted in this decrease in the liability as well as a
    reduction to retained earnings of $4.8 million, a reduction
    in goodwill of $61.4 million, the establishment of a tax
    receivable of $58.2 million, which was recorded in other
    current and non-current assets on our consolidated balance
    sheet, and an increase in an interest/penalty payable of
    $7.9 million, all as of January 1, 2007. Therefore,
    after the adoption of FIN 48, the amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits is $95.7 million as of January 1, 2007,
    of which $28.6 million would impact our effective tax rate,
    if recognized. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is
    $135.2 million as of December 31, 2007. Of this
    amount, $41.0 million would impact our effective tax rate,
    if recognized.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Earnings, which is consistent with
    the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods. As of
    January 1, 2007, we recorded a liability of
    $9.6 million for accrued interest and penalties, of which
    $7.5 million would impact our effective tax rate, if
    recognized. The amount of this liability is $19.6 million
    as of December 31, 2007. Of this amount, $14.7 million
    would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.

We expect that the amount of tax liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits will change in the next twelve months; however, we do
    not expect these changes will have a significant impact on our
    results of operations or financial position.

The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for
    the year 2003 and onward with years 2003 and 2004 currently
    under examination by the IRS. It is reasonably possible that a
    resolution with the IRS for the years 2003 through 2004 will be
    reached within the next twelve months, but we do not anticipate
    this would result in any material impact on our financial
    position. In addition, for the 1999 tax year of Centerpulse,
    which we acquired in October 2003, one issue remains in dispute.
    The resolution of this issue would not impact our effective tax
    rate, as it would be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill.

State income tax returns are generally subject to examination
    for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective
    return. The state impact of any federal changes remains subject
    to examination by various states for a period of up to one year
    after formal notification to the states. We have various state
    income tax returns in the process of examination, administrative
    appeals or litigation. It is reasonably possible that such
    matters will be resolved in the next twelve months, but we do
    not anticipate that the resolution of these matters would result
    in any material impact on our results of operations or financial
    position.

Foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally
    ranging from 3 to 5 years. Years still open to examination
    by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include
    Australia (2003 onward), Canada (1999 onward), France (2005
    onward), Germany (2005 onward), Italy (2003 onward), Japan (2001
    onward), Puerto Rico (2005 onward), Singapore (2003 onward),
    Switzerland (2004 onward), and the United Kingdom (2005 onward).

Our tax returns are currently under examination in various
    foreign jurisdictions. The major foreign tax jurisdictions under
    examination include Germany, Italy and Switzerland. It is
    reasonably possible that such audits will be resolved in the
    next twelve months, but we do not anticipate that the resolution
    of these audits would result in any material impact on our
    results of operations or financial position.

CAPITAL STOCK AND
    EARNINGS PER SHARE

We have 2 million shares of Series A Participating
    Cumulative Preferred Stock authorized for issuance, none of
    which were outstanding as of December 31, 2007.

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is
    net earnings available to common stockholders. The denominator
    for basic earnings per share is the weighted average number of
    common shares outstanding during the period. The denominator for
    diluted earnings per share is weighted average shares
    outstanding adjusted for the effect of dilutive stock options
    and other equity awards. The following is a reconciliation of
    weighted average shares for the basic and diluted share
    computations for the years ending December 31 (in millions):

For the year ended December 31, 2007, an average of
    3.1 million options to purchase shares of common stock were
    not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as
    the exercise prices of these options were greater than the
    average market price of the common stock. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, an average of 7.6 million
    and 2.9 million options, respectively, were not included.

In December 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a stock
    repurchase program of up to $1 billion through
    December 31, 2007. In December 2006, our Board of Directors
    authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to
    $1 billion through December 31, 2008. As of
    December 31, 2007 we had acquired approximately
    19,345,200 shares at a cost of $1,378.9 million,
    before commissions.

SEGMENT
    DATA

We design, develop, manufacture and market reconstructive
    orthopaedic implants, including joint and dental, spinal
    implants, trauma products and related orthopaedic surgical
    products which include surgical supplies and instruments
    designed to aid in orthopaedic surgical procedures and
    post-operation rehabilitation. We also provide other healthcare
    related services. Revenue related to these services currently
    represents less than 1 percent of our total net sales. We
    manage operations through three major geographic
    segments – the Americas, which is comprised
    principally of the United States and includes other North,
    Central and South American markets; Europe, which is comprised
    principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and Africa;
    and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan and
    includes other Asian and Pacific markets. This structure is the
    basis for our reportable segment information discussed below.
    Management evaluates operating segment performance based upon
    segment operating profit exclusive of operating expenses
    pertaining to global operations and corporate expenses,
    share-based compensation expense, settlement, acquisition,
    integration and other expenses, inventory

step-up,

in-process research and development write-offs and intangible
    asset amortization expense. Global operations include research,
    development engineering, medical education, brand management,
    corporate legal, finance, and human resource functions, and
    U.S. and Puerto Rico based manufacturing operations and
    logistics. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated from
    segment operating profit. Management reviews accounts
    receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, goodwill
    and intangible assets by reportable segment exclusive of U.S and
    Puerto Rico based manufacturing operations and logistics and

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES

Product Liability
    and Intellectual Property-Related Litigation

As a result of our acquisition of Centerpulse in 2003, we
    acquired the entity involved in Centerpulse’s hip and knee
    implant litigation matter. The litigation was a result of a
    voluntary recall of certain hip and knee implants manufactured
    and sold by Centerpulse. On March 13, 2002, a
    U.S. Class Action Settlement Agreement was entered
    into by Centerpulse that resolved U.S. claims related to
    the affected products and a settlement trust was established and
    funded for the most part by Centerpulse. The court approved the
    settlement arrangement on May 8, 2002. Under the terms of
    the settlement agreement, we will reimburse the settlement trust
    a specified amount for each revision surgery over 4,000 and
    revisions on reprocessed shells over 64. As of December 31,
    2007, the claims administrator has received 4,133 likely valid
    claims for hips (cut-off date June 5, 2003) and knees
    (cut-off date November 17, 2003) and 200 claims for
    reprocessed shells (cut-off date September 8, 2004). We
    believe the litigation liability recorded as of
    December 31, 2007 is adequate to provide for any future
    claims regarding the hip and knee implant litigation.

On February 15, 2005, Howmedica Osteonics
    Corp.  (“Howmedica”) filed an action against
    us and an unrelated party in the United States District Court
    for the District of New Jersey alleging infringement of
    U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934; 6,372,814; 6,664,308; and
    6,818,020. On June 13, 2007, the Court granted our motion
    for summary judgment on the invalidity of the asserted claims of
    U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174,934; 6,372,814; and 6,664,308 by
    ruling that all of the asserted claims are invalid for
    indefiniteness. We continue to believe that our defenses are
    valid and meritorious, and we intend to defend the Howmedica
    lawsuit vigorously.

We are also subject to product liability and other claims and
    lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, for which
    we maintain insurance, subject to self-insured retention limits.
    We establish accruals for product liability and other claims in
    conjunction with outside counsel based on current information
    and historical settlement information for open claims, related
    fees and for claims incurred but not reported. While it is not
    possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases,
    it is the opinion of management that, upon ultimate resolution,
    these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Government
    Investigations and Related Litigation

In March 2005, the United States Department of Justice through
    the United States Attorney’s Office in Newark, New Jersey
    commenced an investigation of us and four other orthopaedic
    companies pertaining to consulting contracts, professional
    service agreements and other agreements by which remuneration is
    provided to orthopaedic surgeons. On September 27, 2007, we
    reached a settlement with the government to resolve all claims
    related to this investigation. As part of the settlement, we
    entered into a settlement agreement with the United States of
    America through the United States Department of Justice and on
    behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of
    Health and Human Services (the “OIG-HHS”). In
    addition, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the
    “DPA”) with the United States Attorney’s Office
    for the District of New Jersey (the
    “U.S. Attorney”) and a Corporate Integrity
    Agreement (the “CIA”) with the OIG-HHS. We did not
    admit any wrongdoing, plead guilty to any criminal charges or
    pay any criminal fines as part of the settlement.

We settled civil and administrative claims related to the
    federal investigation for a cash payment to the United States
    government of $169.5 million. We recorded a
    $169.5 million expense during the third quarter of 2007 in
    connection with the settlement.

Under the terms of the DPA, the U.S. Attorney filed a
    criminal complaint in the United States District Court for the
    District of New Jersey charging us with conspiracy to commit
    violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C.

§ 1320a-7b)

during the years 2002 through 2006. The court deferred
    prosecution of the criminal complaint during the

18-month

term of the DPA. The U.S. Attorney will seek dismissal of
    the criminal complaint after the 18-month period if we comply
    with the provisions of the DPA. The DPA provides for oversight
    by a federally appointed monitor. Under the CIA, which has a
    term of five years, we agreed, among other provisions, to
    continue the operation of our enhanced Corporate Compliance
    Program, designed to promote compliance with federal healthcare
    program requirements, in accordance with the terms set forth in
    that agreement. We also agreed to retain an independent review
    organization (“IRO”) to perform annual reviews to
    assist us in assessing our compliance with the obligations set
    forth in the CIA to ensure that arrangements we enter into do
    not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Our obligation to retain
    an IRO is suspended during the 18-month term of the DPA. A
    material breach of the DPA or the CIA may subject us to further
    criminal or civil action and/or to exclusion by OIG-HHS from
    participation in all federal healthcare programs, which would
    have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
    results of operations and cash flows.

In November 2007, we received a civil investigative demand from
    the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office seeking
    additional information regarding the financial relationships we
    publicly disclosed pursuant to the DPA with a number of
    Massachusetts healthcare providers. We are cooperating fully
    with the investigators with regard to this matter. We understand
    that similar inquiries were directed to other companies in the
    orthopaedics industry.

In June 2006, we received a subpoena from the United States
    Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting that we
    produce documents for the period beginning January 2001 through
    June 2006, pertaining to an investigation of possible violations
    of federal criminal law, including possible violations of the
    antitrust laws, involving the manufacture and sale of
    orthopaedic implant devices. We are cooperating fully with
    federal authorities with regard to this matter. We understand
    that similar inquiries were directed to at least four other
    companies in the orthopaedics industry.

On September 25, 2007, the Staff of the SEC informed us
    that it was conducting an informal investigation regarding
    potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the
    sale of medical devices in a number of foreign countries by
    companies in the medical device industry. We understand that at
    least four other medical device companies received similar
    letters. We are fully cooperating with the SEC with regard to
    this informal investigation.

Following announcement of our entry into the DPA and CIA and
    commencement of the informal SEC investigation described above,
    two shareholder derivative actions were filed in Kosciusko
    Superior Court in Warsaw, Indiana. The first action, captioned

Bottner v. Dvorak et al

., was filed on
    October 16, 2007. The second action, captioned

Capizzi v. Dvorak et al

., was filed on
    October 30, 2007. On November 19, 2007, these two
    cases were consolidated under the caption

In re Zimmer, Inc.
    Derivative Litigation

. The plaintiffs seek to maintain the
    action purportedly on our behalf against all of our current
    directors and two former directors. On December 10, 2007,
    the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended derivative
    complaint, which claims, among other things, breaches of
    fiduciary duty by the individual defendants which allegedly
    allowed misconduct to occur, including alleged illegal payments
    to doctors, and caused us financial harm, including the cost of
    the settlement with the federal government described above. The
    plaintiffs do not seek damages from us, but instead request
    damages of an unspecified amount on our behalf. The plaintiffs
    also request that the court order (i) disgorgement of
    profits, benefits and other compensation obtained by the
    individual defendants and (ii) certain matters of corporate
    governance be placed before our stockholders for a vote. On
    January 16, 2008, we and the individual defendants filed
    separate motions to dismiss the complaint and memoranda in
    support. We and the individual defendants also filed a joint
    motion to stay discovery pending a ruling on the motions to
    dismiss. The motions are currently pending with the court.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures and
    internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable
    assurance that material information relating to us, including
    our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known on a timely basis
    to management and the Board of Directors. However, no control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are
    met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
    any, within a company have been detected.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
    of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that
    evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as
    of the end of the period covered by this report are effective.

There was no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred
    during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
    Management’s report on internal control over financial
    reporting appears in this report at the conclusion of
    Part II, Item 7A.

ITEM 9B.

Other Information

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors was not asked to and did not approve the
    engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent
    registered public accounting firm, to perform any non-audit
    services. This disclosure is made pursuant to
    Section 10A(i)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
    as added by Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

We submitted the Annual CEO Certification for 2007 required by
    the New York Stock Exchange to the exchange on June 4, 2007.
